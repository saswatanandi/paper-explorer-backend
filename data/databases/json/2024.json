      "abstract": "Agricultural production is highly dependent on the weather. The mechanisms of action are complex and interwoven, making it difficult to identify relevant management and adaptation options. The present study uses random forests to investigate such highly non-linear systems for predicting yield anomalies in winter wheat at district levels in Germany. In order to take into account sub-seasonality, monthly features are used that explicitly take soil moisture into account in addition to extreme meteorological events. Clustering is used to show spatially different damage potentials, such as a higher susceptibility to drought damage from May to July in eastern Germany compared to the rest of the country. In addition, relevant heat effects are not detected if the clusters are not sufficiently defined. The variable with the highest importance is soil moisture in March, where higher soil moisture has a detrimental effect on crop yields. In general, soil moisture explains more yield variations than the meteorological variables. The approach has proven to be suitable for explaining historical extreme yield anomalies for years with exceptionally high losses (2003, 2018) and gains (2014) and the spatial distribution of these anomalies. The highest test -squared ( ) is about 0.68. Furthermore, the sensitivity of yield variations to soil moisture and extreme meteorological conditions, as shown by the visualization of average marginal effects, contributes to the promotion of targeted decision support systems.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 41,
      "abstract": "Water security plays an important role in socio-economic development, ecosystem management, and environmental sustainability. Over the last four decades, water security assessment has attracted much political and economic attention. An improved understanding of the relationships between water demand and supply is needed to mitigate the impacts of diminishing water resources. This study provides an overview of water security assessment by focusing on the various water security indicators and the concept of water footprint (blue, green, and grey water). The water security indicators based on the water footprint concept is currently receiving more attention because it accounts for the return flow from the total water withdrawn from a watershed. We also investigate the application of different physically-based hydrological models, such as Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC), on water security assessment at a regional to continental scale. However, hydrological/agricultural system models cannot quantify evapotranspiration from irrigation and rainwater separately. Therefore, independent quantification of blue and green water footprint from an irrigated field is challenging. For illustration purposes, we apply the fully distributed Agricultural Ecosystems Services (AgES) model in the Big Dry Creek Watershed (BDCW), an intensively managed and irrigated watershed located in semiarid Colorado. The results indicate that the blue water footprint is higher than the green water footprint in the watershed. In addition, the spatial distribution of grey water footprint is highly correlated with the amount of fertilizer application. The variation of grey water footprint among the irrigated fields is higher than blue and green water footprints. We conclude that applying a physically distributed model can provide useful insight into the impact of climate and anthropogenic activities on water security at different scales.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Research",
      "citations": 73,
      "abstract": "One of the main problems of hydrologic/hydrodynamic routing models is defining the right set of parameters, especially on inaccessible and/or large basins. Remote sensing techniques provide measurements of the basin topography, drainage system, and channel width; however current methods for estimating riverbed elevation are not as accurate. This paper presents methods of altimetry data assimilation (DA) for estimating effective bathymetry of a hydrodynamic model. We tested past altimetry observations from satellites ENVISAT, ICESAT, and JASON 2 and synthetic altimetry data from satellites ICESAT 2, JASON 3, SARAL, and Surface Water and Ocean Topography to assess future/present mission's potential. The DA methods used were direct insertion, linear interpolation, the Shuffled Complex Evolution‐University of Arizona optimization algorithm, and an adapted Kalman filter developed with hydraulically based variance and covariance introduced in this paper. The past satellite altimetry DA was evaluated comparing simulated and observed water surface elevation while the synthetic altimetry DA were assessed through a direct comparison with a true bathymetry. The Shuffled Complex Evolution‐University of Arizona and hydraulically based Kalman filter methods presented the best performances, reducing water surface elevation error in 65% in past altimetry data experiment and reducing biased bathymetry error in 75% in the synthetic experiment; however, the latter method is much less computationally expensive. Regarding satellites, it was observed that the performance is related to the satellite intertrack distance, as higher number of observation sites allows more accurate bed elevation estimation.",

      "abstract": "The Himalayan region is vulnerable to climate change, which is triggering extreme hydrological events. To understand the impact of climate emission scenarios on different hydrological flow dynamics of the Himalayan region, a thorough hydrological investigation is needed for improved water resource management. Hence, this research exemplifies the use of remote sensing, modelling techniques, and recent climate projections (CMIP5 and CMIP6) for the assessment of hydrological flow dynamics in the central Himalayan catchment. The SWAT model is calibrated/validated using gauge observation and satellite altimetry-derived river discharge and used for long-term hydrological simulations (1979-2100). CMIP6 models predicted that there would be a steady rise in high flows in all the projected scenarios. Flow duration curve for CMIP5 and CMIP6 models depicted that high flow of short duration would be frequent in future. The environmental flow components (EFCs) were calculated using the indicator of hydrologic alteration tool. The SWAT model simulations of hydrological and EFCs under CMIP6 climate projections are found to be significantly more vulnerable to climate warming than CMIP5, which could be due to socioeconomic pathway emission scenarios.",

Surface relative humidity (RH) and specific humidity (SH) are the main measures of atmospheric moisture. Long‐term changes in these variables in South Korea vary regionally as well as locally, but have not been explored using long‐term observation data. This study analyzes the annual trends of the means and SD of RH, surface air temperature, and SH in South Korea at 55 stations for the period 1973–2018. Three trend detection tests based on the Mann–Kendall test have been performed to detect trends at the 5% significance level for the annual and monthly statistics (means and SD ) of these variables. Significant decreasing and increasing trends have been detected in the annual means of RH and air temperature, while the annual mean of SH has remained nearly constant. Overall, the surface air in South Korea has become drier over the study period, particularly in winter. The trend in RH and SH varies widely according to months to result in the increase in the SD over the annual cycle. The monthly SD of RH, SH, and surface air temperature show especially large positive trends for March and September, when the transition from winter to spring and summer to fall, respectively, occurs.",

      "journal": "Earth Systems and Environment",
      "citations": 3,
      "abstract": "Humidity plays a critical role in amplifying temperature impact, leading to reduced heat dissipation efficiency and severe heat stress in humans. In the specific context of North China, this study explored different sensitivities of extreme heat stress (measured by wet-bulb temperature, TW) to humidity and temperature, and analyzed the influence of upstream variables on extreme heat stress. It is found that in the past four decades, extreme heat stress in North China increased rapidly at a maximum rate of over 0.4 °C/decade, accompanied by the influence of humidity on extreme heat stress surpasses that of temperature. Even slight fluctuations in humidity can result in substantial variations in heat stress levels, unlike equivalent changes in temperature. This study is the first to find that for extreme heat stress, changes in temperature can only increase TW by up to 0.5 °C, while increase in humidity can increase TW by 3 °C. Notably, both humidity and temperature begin to rise approximately three days prior to extreme days, coinciding with intensified humidity transport and temperature advection from the upstream region. This study is also the first to find that intensified humidity transport is primarily driven by remarkably high evaporation originating from the western extension of the Northwest Pacific Subtropical High, while the strengthened temperature advection stems from a north–south temperature gradient during extreme days. This mechanism, wherein upstream variables impact downstream conditions, holds significant value for accurate prediction and timely response strategies.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 14,
      "abstract": "The response of vegetation water use efficiency (WUE) to soil or atmospheric moisture conditions has been widely identified in the past decades, however, the relationships between soil-atmospheric coupling and global vegetation WUE remain unclear under different CO 2 emission scenarios at the end of the 21st century. In this study, we investigated the evolution and characteristics of global soil-atmospheric coupling by the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and soil moisture (SM), and vegetation WUE for both the baseline period (1982–2014) and future periods (2015–2100) under four representative pathways using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 data, and then quantified the impacts of soil-atmospheric coupling on global WUE. Results indicate that the global average vegetation WUE will increase significantly in the future, and the SSP5-8.5 is observed at the fastest growth rate at 0.0902 gC kg −1 H 2 O/decade. Global soil and atmospheric are projected to become drier, especially in the Amazon and Patagonia plateaus, the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Plains; however, VPD remains relatively stable after 2050 under the SSP1-2.6 scenario, highlighting the effectiveness of active restoration policies on atmospheric drought elimination. It is revealed that over 82.13% of vegetated land exhibits a negative correlation between SM and VPD, suggesting vegetation is more susceptible to coupled soil-atmosphere, and SM-VPD coupling tend to occur during the warm season. Approximately 47–59% of global vegetated land is dominated by SM-VPD under four climate scenarios, mainly in the 20°–60°N and 20°–40°S. The affected area expands under moderate and high emission scenarios, particularly in croplands and grasslands. As climate warms, low-altitude regions will become more susceptible to VPD, and some temperature vegetation may transfer from reliance on SM-VPD to dependence on SM. These findings enrich the understanding of global vegetation WUE trends and provide deeper insights into soil-atmosphere coupling and WUE interactions.",

      "abstract": "An outstanding issue of hydrological modeling is the adequate treatment of uncertainties in model calibration and prediction. The current paradigm is that the major sources of uncertainties, namely input, output and model uncertainty should be accounted for directly, instead of assuming they can be safely lumped into the output uncertainties. In this paper, Bayesian analysis is used to calibrate the conceptual hydrologic monthly model GR2M taking into account input, output, structural and initial state uncertainty through error models and priors. Calibration is performed under different error assumptions to study the influence of the initial state uncertainty, the consequences of large input errors, the impact of error assumptions on calibrated parameter posterior distributions and the definition of error models. It is shown how such an analysis can be used to separate, a posteriori , the different sources of errors, and in particular, to identify structural errors from data errors.",

      "title": "Bayesian flood forecasting methods: A review",
      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 144,
      "abstract": "Over the past few decades, floods have been seen as one of the most common and largely distributed natural disasters in the world. If floods could be accurately forecasted in advance, then their negative impacts could be greatly minimized. It is widely recognized that quantification and reduction of uncertainty associated with the hydrologic forecast is of great importance for flood estimation and rational decision making. Bayesian forecasting system (BFS) offers an ideal theoretic framework for uncertainty quantification that can be developed for probabilistic flood forecasting via any deterministic hydrologic model. It provides suitable theoretical structure, empirically validated models and reasonable analytic-numerical computation method, and can be developed into various Bayesian forecasting approaches. This paper presents a comprehensive review on Bayesian forecasting approaches applied in flood forecasting from 1999 till now. The review starts with an overview of fundamentals of BFS and recent advances in BFS, followed with BFS application in river stage forecasting and real-time flood forecasting, then move to a critical analysis by evaluating advantages and limitations of Bayesian forecasting methods and other predictive uncertainty assessment approaches in flood forecasting, and finally discusses the future research direction in Bayesian flood forecasting.Results show that the Bayesian flood forecasting approach is an effective and advanced way for flood estimation, it considers all sources of uncertainties and produces a predictive distribution of the river stage, river discharge or runoff, thus gives more accurate and reliable flood forecasts. Some emerging Bayesian forecasting methods (e.g. ensemble Bayesian forecasting system, Bayesian multi-model combination) were shown to overcome limitations of single model or fixed model weight and effectively reduce predictive uncertainty. In recent years, various Bayesian flood forecasting approaches have been developed and widely applied, but there is still room for improvements. Future research in the context of Bayesian flood forecasting should be on assimilation of various sources of newly available information and improvement of predictive performance assessment methods.",

      "abstract": "Reliability of flood stage and inundation extent predictions are affected by the performance of a hydraulic model. However, uncertainties at all times exist in the model setup process. Therefore, prediction from a single hydraulic model implementation may be subject to huge uncertainty. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is applied in this study to combine ensemble predictions from different hydraulic model implementations and to develop a robust deterministic water stage prediction as well as the prediction distribution. The BMA approach is tested over the Black River watershed in Missouri and Arkansas based on water stage predictions from 81 LISFLOOD-FP model configurations that integrate four sources of uncertainty including channel shape, channel width, channel roughness and flow input. Model ensemble simulation outputs are trained with observed water stage data during one flood event to obtain the weight and variance for each model member, and BMA prediction ability is then validated for another flood event. The results indicate that the BMA approach is able to provide consistently good and reliable deterministic flood stage prediction across the basin, though it does not always outperform the best model in the ensemble. The BMA water stage prediction has better performance than the ensemble mean prediction. Additionally, high-chance flood inundation extent derived from a BMA probabilistic flood map is more accurate than the probabilistic flood inundation extent based on the equal model weights in the Black River watershed.",

The BN model was trained to compute flood peak forecasts from AEFs and hydrological pre-conditions. The mean absolute relative error was calculated as 0.076 for validation data. An artificial neural network (ANN) was applied for the same problem but showed inferior performance with a mean absolute relative error of 0.39. It seems that BN is less sensitive to small data sets, thus it is more suited for flood peak forecasting than ANN.",

      "citations": 65,
      "abstract": "Reservoir operation rules play a key role in real-time reservoir operation; the main factors affecting operation decisions are the current reservoir status and the future inflows. However, the future reservoir inflows are stochastic and always contain uncertainty. To study the influence of inflow uncertainty on reservoir operation rules, this paper proposes a Bayesian Deep learning method that considers both model parameter uncertainty and inflow uncertainty. In the model, the Monte Carlo integration is used to convert the complex integrals of inflow probability into a summation form. Variational inference is employed to obtain the posterior distribution of model parameters. The proposed method is applied to a real-world application at Three Gorges Project on the Yangtze River. The uncertainty estimation results show that the influence of inflow uncertainty on reservoir operation rule is greater than model parameter uncertainty, and the decision of reservoir operation is more sensitive to the reservoir inflow during dry season than other seasons. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian deep learning performs better than the comparison method in term of hydropower generation and the root mean square errors. Moreover, the proposed method is more robust than the comparison method when considering the inflow uncertainty.",

      "abstract": "Water resources allocation is very important for water resources management. However, it is subject to the uncertainty in water availability (WA) or water demand (WD), as well as the pressure exerted by multi-stakeholders. Therefore, we propose a general framework as following:(i) applying Bayes theorem to develop a forecasting model for WA and WD probability distributions;(ii) constructing the matching matrix showing matching degree between WA and WD and assessing the probabilistic behavior of water resources allocation solutions based on the matching matrices; and (iii) performing the trade-off analysis among the solutions under different stakeholders’ objectives to meet requirements of multi-stakeholders. Longgang River basin is selected as a case study area to demonstrate the proposed framework. Results show that, the forecast probability distributions of WA and WD may be updated timely with newly introduced data, and reflect their statistical characters well. Furthermore, the matching matrices illustrate the probabilities of the possible outcomes of each allocation solution clearly. From the probabilistic assessment; the results suggest: 21160× 10 4 m 3 diverted water are required to surely satisfy the current water demands, which is exactly the amount currently diverted for the study area. The proposed framework provides the updated probabilistic assessment for the possible outcomes, contributing to stakeholders to perform the tradeoff with each other. It makes significant contributions to address water allocation issues under uncertainty and is worthy to be applied broadly.",

The observed climatology was used as prior information, and results of a linear regression model that describes the relationship between ‘the observed streamflow’ and ‘the mean of the Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) forecasts’ was used to form a likelihood function. The Bayes' theorem was then applied to produce posterior information for the streamflow forecast. Thirty-five watersheds, in which a dam is operated, were tested in this study, and the forecast accuracy was evaluated. It was found that the developed Bayesian ESP (B-ESP) model is capable of improving the forecast accuracy of the ESP. It was found that the forecasting accuracy was improved for all the different lengths of lead-times with the B-ESP model. Nonetheless, the B-ESP model obtained lower RPSS values than the ESP, while its deterministic forecasting accuracy was better than the ESP.

To achieve an ensemble simulation, a Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method was applied to integrate temporally sensitive empirical model predictions given by random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and Elman neural network (ENN). The results showed that: (a) The ENN performed the worst among the three; (b) The BMA approach outperformed the individual models (i.e., RF, ENN, and SVM) in terms of Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and the percentage of bias (Pbias). The BMA weights reflect the model performance and the correlation of the predictions given by its ensemble models.

      "journal": "Dissertation",
      "citations": 0,
      "abstract": "    The predictive uncertainty quantification in monthly streamflows is crucial to make reliable hydrological predictions that help and support decision-making in water resources management. Hydrological post-processing methods are suitable tools to estimate the predictive uncertainty of deterministic streamflow predictions (hydrological model outputs). In general, this thesis focuses on improving hydrological post-processing methods for assessing the conditional predictive uncertainty of monthly streamflows. This thesis deal with two issues of the hydrological post-processing scheme i) the heteroscedasticity problem and ii) the intractable likelihood problem. Mainly, this thesis includes three specific aims. First and relate to the heteroscedasticity problem, we develop and evaluate a new post-processing approach, called GMM post-processor, which is based on the Bayesian joint probability modelling approach and the Gaussian mixture models. Besides, we compare the performance of the proposed post-processor with the well-known exiting post-processors for monthly streamflows across 12 MOPEX catchments. From this aim (chapter 2), we find that the GMM post-processor is the best suited for estimating the conditional predictive uncertainty of monthly streamflows, especially for dry catchments.Secondly, we introduce a method to quantify the conditional predictive uncertainty in hydrological post-processing contexts when it is cumbersome to calculate the likelihood (intractable likelihood). Sometimes, it can be challenging to estimate the likelihood itself in hydrological modelling, especially working with complex models or with ungauged catchments. Therefore, we propose the ABC post-processor that exchanges the requirement of calculating the likelihood function by the use of some sufficient summary statistics and synthetic datasets. With this aim in mind (chapter 3), we prove that the conditional predictive distribution is similarly produced by the exact predictive (MCMC post-processor) or the approximate predictive (ABC post-processor), qualitatively speaking. This finding is significant because dealing with scarce information is a common condition in hydrological studies.Finally, we apply the ABC post-processing method to estimate the uncertainty of streamflow statistics obtained from climate change projections, such as a particular case of intractable likelihood problem. From this specific objective (chapter 4), we find that the ABC post-processor approach: 1) offers more reliable projections than 14 climate models (without post-processing); 2) concerning the best climate models during the baseline period, produces more realistic uncertainty bands than the classical multi-model ensemble approach.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 36,
      "abstract": "Uncertainty in a hydrodynamic model originates from input data, model structure and parameters. In order to provide the robust model predictions, the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach could be used as a multi-model combining method to account for the compound effects from various uncertainty sources. However, BMA cannot provide a clear picture of the impact from individual uncertainty sources. Hierarchical Bayesian model averaging (HBMA) is a recently developed approach to study the relative impact of different uncertainty sources, which explicitly considers various sources of uncertainty in the hierarchical structure (BMA tree) for analysing uncertainty propagation. In this study, HBMA is tested over the Black River watershed in Missouri and Arkansas based on water stage predictions from 243 LISFLOOD-FP model configurations that integrate five sources of uncertainty including channel shape, channel width, channel roughness, topography and flow forcing. To compare, the model perturbation approach is also applied in this study to investigate the influence of individual uncertainty sources on model prediction. Overall, the results indicate that HBMA provides an alternative way for flood modellers to deal with modelling uncertainty in data sparse region when multiple choices of uncertainty sources are considered. Findings from Black River watershed point out that without considering the model weight (model perturbation approach), channel width and topographical data resolution have the largest impact on the hydrodynamic model predictions followed by flow forcing, which has a relatively greater influence than channel cross-sectional shape and model parameter. However, when model weights are taken into account (HBMA), model input (topography and flow forcing) and model parameter have a larger impact on prediction variance than model structure (channel width and cross-sectional shape). Moreover, as results move up the hierarchy along the BMA tree, the accuracy of deterministic mean prediction also increases in general whereas the 95% confidence interval associated with the deterministic mean prediction might become larger.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 18,
      "abstract": "Wetland hydrology differs by landscapes and thus a modeling structure that best characterize wetland hydrological processes may vary. However, structural uncertainty of wetland modeling has been assessed in few landscapes. Limited understanding of structural uncertainty remains for a landscape dominated by groundwater. This study used Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to assess structural uncertainty in catchment-scale wetland hydrology on the Coastal Plain of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, where landscape hydrology is greatly affected by groundwater. This study investigated the differences in streamflow prediction and quantification of wetland loss impacts on streamflow among three wetland modeling structures. Two lumped structures (SS and RS) and one semi-spatial structure (RG) were examined in this study. Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) was used to generate the ensemble of three model structures. To reduce parameter uncertainty on model outputs, streamflow parameters were constrained by using the same streamflow parameter set that was mutually acceptable for the three wetland modeling structures. Results showed that the three model structures exhibited different streamflow predictions and hydrologic changes by wetland loss. The RG structure provided the best streamflow simulation results due to its accurate prediction on low-flow conditions relative to the two other structures (SS and RS). The BMA results also indicated less accurate model prediction of streamflow compared to the RG. Hydrologic changes resulting from wetland loss were best captured by the RG structure that mimicked wetland water storage functions such as peak flow changes and annual streamflow variation. In contrast, the results from the two other structures and BMA did not accurately reflect those functions in responses to wetlands loss. The RG structure showed superior simulation of wetland hydrology due to its semi-spatial model structure. In contrast, poor BMA results were attributed to poor predictions from lumped model structures (SS and RS). These results suggest that a spatial model structure is critical to simulate wetland hydrologic processes in a landscape with a high dependency on groundwater processes, and wetland modeling development should be toward an explicit spatial characterization of wetlands.",

      "abstract": "Merged multisatellite precipitation datasets (MMPDs) combine the advantages of individual satellite precipitation products (SPPs), have a tendency to reduce uncertainties, and provide higher potentials to hydrological applications. This study applied a dynamic clustered Bayesian model averaging (DCBA) algorithm to merge four SPPs across Pakistan. The DCBA algorithm produced dynamic weights to different SPPs varying both spatially and temporally to accommodate the spatiotemporal differences of SPP performances. The MMPD is developed at daily temporal scale from 2000 to 2015 with spatial resolution of 0.25° using extensively evaluated SPPs and a global atmospheric reanalysis–precipitation dataset: Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42V7, Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks–Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), Climate Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH), and ERA-Interim. The DCBA algorithm is evaluated across four distinct climate regions of Pakistan over 102 ground precipitation gauges (GPGs). DCBA forecasting outperformed all four SPPs with average Theil’s U of 0.49, 0.38, 0.37, and 0.36 in glacial, humid, arid, and hyperarid regions, respectively. The average mean bias error (MBE), mean error (MAE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (CC), and standard deviation (SD) of DCBA over all of Pakistan are 0.54, 1.40, 4.94, 0.77, and 5.17 mm day −1 , respectively. Seasonal evaluation revealed a dependency of DCBA performance on precipitation magnitude/intensity and elevation. Relatively poor DCBA performance is observed in premonsoon/monsoon seasons and at high/mild elevated regions. Average improvements of DCBA in comparison with TMPA are 59.56% (MBE), 49.37% (MAE), 45.89% (RMSE), 19.48% (CC), 46.7% (SD), and 18.66% (Theil’s U ). Furthermore, DCBA efficiently captured extreme precipitation trends (premonsoon/monsoon seasons).",

In this study, we focus on Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) and Averaging (BMA), Pseudo-BMS/BMA and Bayesian Stacking. We want to foster their proper use by, first, clarifying their theoretical background and, second, contrasting their behaviours in an applied groundwater modelling task. We show that only Bayesian Stacking has the goal of model averaging for improved predictions by model combination. The other approaches pursue the quest of finding a single best model as the ultimate goal, and use model averaging only as a preliminary stage to prevent rash model choice. Improved predictions are thereby not guaranteed. In accordance with so-called M-settings that clarify the alleged relations between models and truth, we elicit which method is most promising.",

      "abstract": "Conceptual rainfall‐runoff models account for the spatial dynamics of hydrological processes in a basin using simple spatially lumped storage‐flow relations. Such rough approximations introduce model errors that are often difficult to characterize. Here, we develop and apply a methodology that recursively estimates and accounts for model errors in real‐time streamflow prediction settings by adding time‐dependent random noise to the internal states (storages) of the hydrological model. Magnitude of the added noise depends on a precision (inverse variance) parameter that is estimated from rainfall‐runoff data. A recursive Bayesian technique is used for estimation: posteriors of hydrological parameters and states are updated through time with an ensemble Kalman filter, whereas the posterior of the precision parameter is updated recursively using a novel gamma density approximation technique. Applying this algorithm to different model error scenarios allows identification of the main source of model errors. The methodology is applied to short‐term streamflow prediction with the Hymod rainfall‐runoff model in a semi‐cold, semi‐humid basin in Iran. Results show that (i) streamflow prediction in this snow‐dominated basin is more affected by model errors in the slow flow than the quick flow component of the model, (ii) accounting for model errors in the slow flow component improves both low and high flow predictions, and (iii) predictive performance further improves by accounting for Hymod parameter uncertainty in addition to model errors. Overall, accounting for model errors increased Nash‐Sutcliffe efficiency (by 1–5%), reduced mean absolute error (by 2–43%), and improved probabilistic predictive performance (by 50–80%).",

In this fully Bayesian framework, the DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm with a novel likelihood function is combined with Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). Four alternative conceptual models, representing different geological representations of an overexploited aquifer, have been developed. The uncertainty of the input of the model is represented by multipliers. A novel likelihood function based on a new heteroscedastic error model is included to extend the applicability of the framework. The results of the study confirm that neglecting conceptual model structure uncertainty results in unreliable prediction. Consideration of both model structure and input uncertainty are important to obtain confident parameter sets and better model predictions. This study shows that the IBMUEF provides more reliable model predictions and accurate uncertainty bounds.",

      "citations": 15,
      "abstract": "Copula-based statistical model has been extensively used to characterize the joint probability behaviors of extreme hydro-climatic design events, such as bivariate design floods. However, parameter uncertainty, not desirably but inevitably, accompanies the copula-based design flood estimation (CDFE) model which makes the inference results of design flood ambiguous. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian information-theoretic (BIT) approach to disclose design flood uncertainty arising from parameter uncertainty in CDFE model and furthermore examine how the parameter uncertainty is propagated to design flood estimation. Two catchments located in the Yellow River Basin, China, are selected as study regions. The research we have done indicates that design flood uncertainty is considerably large under parameter uncertainty. Worse still, the uncertainty in design flood increases along with the return period, thus making the design flood inference more ambiguous. Specifically, shape and scale parameters of marginal distributions have the largest contribution to the design flood uncertainty, followed by copula parameter, finally the location parameter of marginal distribution. Furthermore, the interaction between some parameters has dominant effect on design flood uncertainty compared with the individual effect of these parameters. These findings will enable better understanding the design flood uncertainty under parameter uncertainty. Moreover, the proposed BIT approach also offers a promising technical reference for design estimation of other types of extreme hydrological events, not limited to the design flood.",

Erosion and sediment transfer in river catchments are controlled by different processes, whose relative importance varies in space and time. We thus put forward that SY can be estimated more efficiently by using explicitly the information contained in the similarity within groups. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel Bayesian hierarchical model, applied it to a sample of heterogeneous river catchments and compared its fixed-effects and mixed-effects performance incorporating different group levels, namely gauges, rivers, basins and clusters of catchments. With a parsimonious linear model consisting of four variables (specific and extreme discharge, elevation and retention coefficient), we achieved good performance criteria in the calibration (NSE: 0.79–0.85) and in the cross-validation for temporal and spatial prediction (NSE: 0.71 and 0.72, respectively). These results support the promising potential of this technique.",

      "abstract": "We develop a Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) for estimating the statistical parameters for monthly average streamflows. We assume monthly average streamflow can be characterized by a three-parameter log-normal distribution (LN3). The three underlying statistical parameters are shift, shape, and location. When estimating a parameter, such as the shape, of a given month the BHM utilizes historical observations not only from the month under consideration but also from all other months. This is different from traditional statistical parameter estimation methods that only use historical observations for the month under consideration. We apply the proposed BHM for parameter estimation to eight watersheds in the United States, where historical unimpaired streamflows have been collected. We also carry out parameter estimation using traditional methods, such as the maximum likelihood estimation, the method of moments, and the L-moment method. Using cross-validation with test data log-likelihood as the measure of performance, the results show that BHM outperforms traditional estimation methods. In addition, we show that as available observation data decreases, the more the proposed method improves relative to traditional methods. Since BHM utilizes information contained in the entire data set, it is especially suited for parameter estimation where historical observations are limited. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis between BHM and an autoregressive model to demonstrate the advantage of BHM.",

Also, the efficiency of AM-H and conventional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification are compared. And the procedure was implemented and discussed for the case of Chaohu city, China. Results of our work reveal that: (i) the adaptive Bayesian method, especially for return level associated to large return period, shows better estimated effect when compared with MLE; it should be noted that the implementation of MLE often produces overy optimistic results in the case of Chaohu city; (ii) AM-H algorithm is more reliable than MLE in terms of uncertainty quantification, and yields relatively narrow credible intervals for the quantile estimates to be instrumental in risk assessment of urban storm drainage planning.",

      "abstract": "Stormwater runoff pollution has become a key environmental issue in urban areas. Reliable estimation of stormwater pollutant discharge is important for implementing robust water quality management strategies. Even though significant attempts have been undertaken to develop water quality models, deterministic approaches have proven inappropriate as they do not address the variability in stormwater quality. Due to the random nature of rainfall characteristics and the differences in catchment characteristics, it is difficult to generate the runoff pollutographs to a desired level of certainty. Bayesian hierarchical modelling is an effective tool for developing complex models with a large number of sources of variability. A Bayesian model does not look for a single value of the model parameters, but rather determines a distribution of the model parameters from which all inference is drawn. This study introduces a Bayesian hierarchical linear regression model to describe a catchment specific runoff pollutograph incorporating the associated uncertainties in the model parameters. The model incorporates catchment and rainfall characteristics including the effective impervious area, time of concentration, rain duration, average rainfall intensity and the antecedent dry period as the contributors to random effects.",

      "abstract": "A novel Bayesian Hierarchical Network Model (BHNM) for ensemble forecasts of daily streamflow is presented that uses the spatial dependence induced by the river network topology and hydrometeorological variables from the upstream contributing area between station gauges. Model parameters are allowed to vary with time as functions of selected covariates for each day. Using the network structure to incorporate flow information from upstream gauges and precipitation from the immediate contributing area as covariates allows one to model the spatial correlation of flows simultaneously and parsimoniously. An application to daily monsoon period (July–August) streamflow at three gauges in the Narmada basin in central India for the period 1978–2014 is presented. The best set of covariates include daily streamflow from upstream gauges or from the gauge above the upstream gauges depending on travel times and daily precipitation from the area between two stations. The model validation indicates that the model is highly skillful relative to a null‐model of generalized linear regression, which represents the analogous non‐Bayesian forecast. The ensemble spread of BHNM accounts for the forecast uncertainty leading to reliable and skillful streamflow predictions.",

      "abstract": "Because of the earth system complexity, groundwater/hydrology models are always built with structural errors, which may lead to systematic errors in model predictions. Bayesian data‐driven methods (DDMs) provide a feasible way to correct systematic model errors statistically. Generally, the physical and statistical model parameters, namely physical parameters and hyperparameters, are assumed to be independent and jointly calibrated. However, this assumption may be unreasonable and lead to over‐adjusted parameter estimation and biased model prediction. This study proposes a two‐stage DDM to calibrate physical parameters and hyperparameters separately, which does not make the independence assumption. Three case studies, including a groundwater solute transport analytical model, a three‐dimensional groundwater flow model, and a real‐world snowmelt runoff model, were used to evaluate the predictive performance of this two‐stage DDM. Based on the three case studies, we found that the independence assumption of physical parameters and hyperparameters could lead to the over‐fitting of parameter estimation and deviations in model predictions. Two‐stage DDM can constrain the systematic error model calibration; that is, physical parameters are first calibrated in the entire hyperparameter prior probability space, and then hyperparameters are calibrated in the posterior probability space of physical parameters obtained previously. As a result, compared with traditional joint calibration‐based DDM, two‐stage DDM can alleviate parameter over‐fitting and improve model predictive performance.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 97,
      "abstract": "Merging gauge observation with a single original satellite-based precipitation product (SPP) is a common approach to generate spatial precipitation estimates. For the generation of high-quality precipitation maps, however, this common method has two drawbacks: (1) the spatial resolutions of original SPPs are still too coarse; and (2) a single SPP can’t capture the spatial pattern of precipitation well. To overcome these drawbacks, a two-step scheme consisting of downscaling and fusion was proposed to merge gauge observation with multiple SPPs. In both downscaling and fusion steps, the geographically weighted ridge regression (GWRR) method, which is a combination of the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method and the ridge regression method, is proposed and implemented to generate improved spatial precipitation estimates by overcoming the collinearity problem of the pure GWR method. The proposed two-step merging scheme was applied to Xijiang Basin of China for deriving daily precipitation estimates from the data of both gauge observation and four near real-time SPPs (i.e., TMPA-3B42RT, CMORPH, PERSIANN and GSMaP_NRT) during the period of 2010–2017. The results showed that: (1) the collinearity problem caused by GWR was not serious in downscaling but serious enough to prevent GWR from being directly used in the fusion; and (2) the proposed two-step merging scheme significantly improved the spatial resolution and accuracy of precipitation estimates over the original SPPs. Comparisons also showed that, in the second step (fusion) of the merging scheme, the use of multiple SPPs provided more reliable spatial precipitation estimates than using a single SPP.",

In this study, we used the operational IMERG-Late Run version 06 product along with several meteorological and land surface parameters (elevation, soil type, land type, soil moisture, and daily maximum and minimum temperature) to produce an improved precipitation product in the Brahmaputra basin. We trained, tested, and optimized ML algorithms using 4 years (from 2015 through 2019) of reference rainfall data derived from the rain gauge. The ML generated precipitation product exhibited improved systematic and random error statistics for the study area, which is a strong indication for using the proposed algorithms in retrieving precipitation across the globe. We conclude that the proposed ML-based ensemble framework has the potential to quantify and correct the error sources for improving and promoting the use of satellite-based precipitation estimates for water resources applications.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 46,
      "abstract": "Many studies have used data from climate models, such as global climate models (GCMs) and regional climate models (RCMs), to predict the future impact of climate change. However, a bias exists between simulated climate model data and observed data. Therefore, various bias correction methods have been developed to reduce this imbalance. The quantile mapping (QM) method is one of the most widely used approaches worldwide. However, the QM method does not account for the relative change in the raw data since bias correction is only performed on observed data. To solve this problem, the detrended quantile mapping (DQM) and quantile delta mapping (QDM) methods were developed to consider the relative changes in the raw data. Generally, the QM method is performed assuming that the statistical characteristics are the same when using cumulative density functions (CDFs) obtained from climate models and observations. However, the general QM (or QDM) method is performed using daily data, and thus the outcome may be slightly different from the quantiles of observed data in the statistical analysis of extreme data. This difference can lead to distortions when estimating relative changes in rainfall quantiles. Herein, the regional quantile delta mapping (RQDM) method for bias correction, which can solve the problems of the QDM method, was proposed. Additionally, evaluations were performed for the RQDM and existing QDM methods using several statistical approaches for a historical period (S0; 1979–2005). The results revealed that the RQDM method was similarly corrected to the observed results than the QDM method and produced more appropriate outcomes based on statistical evaluations. Moreover, the RQDM method showed a well-preserved relative changes in rainfall quantiles of the raw data, unlike the QDM method. Thus, it was found that the proposed RQDM method showed more robust results than the conventional QDM method.",

      "abstract": "Bias correction is a vital technique to correct the climate model outputs for regional studies. Prior bias correction methods such as quantile mapping (QM) may be problematic in correcting extreme values. Herein we proposed a novel bias correction method, that is, the piecewise‐quantile mapping (PQM), by combing piecewise mapping with QM, which implements bias corrections on both extreme and nonextreme data. We compared the PQM method and other six commonly used methods in correcting daily precipitation in the Mekong River Basin (MRB) and the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) from two global climate models (GCMs) (i.e., EC‐Earth3 and MPI‐ESM1‐2‐HR) in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Our results show that the PQM perform better in bias correction pertaining to both the precipitation percentiles and most of the extremes indices. For example, the mean absolute error of R20mm (the number of days when precipitation ≥20 mm) is significantly reduced from 21.64 to 9.03 days and from 10.96 to 5.71 days over MRB and YRB, respectively. In addition, the PQM could capture the spatial distributions of extremes indices reasonably well. The PQM developed in this study provides more accurate bias correction of the GCMs outputs, which will reduce the uncertainty in the subsequent analyses, such as climate change impacts on hydrological and biogeochemical cycles, particularly under extreme conditions.",

      "abstract": "Recently developed remote sensing data including satellite-based products show promising performance in estimating precipitation at high spatiotemporal resolution. However, the inherent uncertainties associated with indirect precipitation measurements can limit their applications. In this study, a novel approach based on regression-based quantile mapping (RQM) combined with spatial interpolation and a clustering algorithm is proposed to adjust the spatial and temporal biases of Integrated Multi-satEllite Retrievals for Global precipitation measurement (IMERG-V06) Final Run across Canada from 2014 to 2018 at a daily time scale. Ground precipitation observed at a total of 530 gauges is provided by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). A set of invariant and time-varying topographic and climatic explanatory variables are selected and resampled to the satellite grid spatial resolution (0.1°) to develop the RQM model. The bias adjustment method is applied at gauged sites to estimate the parameters for different quantile levels of precipitation amounts. The parameters are then interpolated for the ungauged grids based on the climatic similarities between different locations and the spatial distribution of rain gauges. The proposed method shows promising results, reducing the overall relative bias (RBias) by ∼32% and increasing the correlation by ∼ 0.31 for 2014-2018. The correlation coefficient (CC) values averaged over the clusters during the cold (November to March) and warm (April to October) months are improved by 167% (from 0.3 to 0.8) and 50% (from 0.6 to 0.9), respectively. In terms of probability of detection (POD) and false alarm ratio (FAR), bias-adjusted data indicates more than 50% improvement for all seasons. The results indicate that the proposed approach can be applied for the bias correction of other remotely sensed products worldwide.",

      "abstract": "Statistical downscaling of daily precipitation is important for assessing the impact of climate change. However, some issues (e.g., the underestimation of extremes) limit statistical downscaling methods to project daily precipitation accurately. This study develops an integrated hybrid statistical downscaling model combined with bias correction and Bayesian model averaging (named as SDBC-BMA) for improving the ability of downscaling methods. The performance of SDBC is compared with regression based statistical downscaling methods (RSDM) and hybrid statistical downscaling methods (HSDM) based on different performance metrics and extreme indices. SDBC-BMA is applied to the Amu Darya River Basin (ADRB) to demonstrate its feasibility and capability, where three GCMs and two CMIP6 scenarios are considered. Several findings can be summarized: (1) compared to RSDM and HSDM, SDBC is more robust with a higher computation ability of daily precipitation and a lower mean bias (i.e., +0.10 mm/day); (2) compared with the simple model average, the biases of extreme indices and mean daily precipitation obtained from SDBC-BMA could decrease by 49 % and 88 %, respectively; (3) the mean precipitation values would increase by 56 ± 41 mm/year (under SSP245) and 126 ± 55 mm/year (under SSP585) during 2076–2100, higher than mean precipitation in the historical period (1979–2005); (4) extreme indices under multi-GCMs (except for consecutive wet days) would increase by 20 % (under SSP245) and 22 % (under SSP585), implying that extreme events in ADRB are more frequent in the 21st century. The increasing risk of precipitation extremes would exacerbate threats to agricultural and ecological security.",

      "abstract": "Statistical post-processing techniques are widely used to reduce systematic biases and quantify forecast uncertainty in numerical weather prediction (NWP). In this study, we propose a method to correct the raw daily forecast precipitation by combining large-scale circulation patterns with local spatiotemporal information such as topography and meteorological factors. Particularly, we first use the self-organizing map (SOM) model to classify large-scale circulation patterns for each season, then build the convolutional neural network (CNN) model to extract spatial information (e.g., elevation, specific humidity, and mean sea level pressure) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) model to extract time series (e.g., t, t-1, t-2), and finally correct local precipitation for each circulation pattern separately. Furthermore, the proposed method (SOM-CNN-LSTM) is compared with other benchmark methods (i.e., CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM) in the Huaihe River basin with a lead time of 15 days from 2007 to 2021. The results show that the proposed SOM-CNN-LSTM post-processing method outperforms other benchmark methods for all lead times and each season with the largest correlation coefficient improvement (32.30 %) and root mean square error reduction (26.58 %). Moreover, the proposed method can effectively capture the westward and northward movement of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), which impacts the basin's summer rain. The results illustrate that incorporating large-scale circulation patterns with local spatiotemporal information is a feasible and effective post-processing method to improve forecasting skills, which would benefit hydrological forecasts and other applications.",

In this study, a multiplicative error-based approach was used for correcting systematic bias in the SPPs at Western Ghats (WG) region of India. Most of the SPPs available so far underestimate the monsoon rainfall in WG. Quality controlled gridded rain gauge data from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) was used as the ground data for bias correction. Bias correction of three multi-satellite precipitation products, namely, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42 Version 7, Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) and Climate Prediction Center (CPC) MORPHed (CMORPH) precipitation, were performed in this study. The results show that bias correction remarkably reduced the bias between the SPPs and IMD rainfall measurements. The efficacy of bias-corrected SPPs in hydrologic modelling was investigated with the help of two conceptual rainfall runoff models, GR4J and HYMOD. The bias-corrected SPPs were able to provide improved streamflow simulations with daily Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and correlation coefficients greater than 0.4 and 0.7, respectively. It was also found that the performance of the model HYMOD was marginally better than that of GR4J in predicting streamflow in terms of NSE, linear correlation coefficient, and p-factor for all five validation catchments in the WG region. This study contributes to the ongoing research on error characterization of SPPs for improved global hydrometeorological modelling.",

      "citations": 35,
      "abstract": "Earth observations offer potential pathways for accurately closing the water and energy balance of watersheds, a fundamental challenge in hydrology. However, previous attempts based on purely satellite‐based estimates have focused on closing the water and energy balances separately. They are hindered by the lack of estimates of key components, such as runoff. Here, we posit a novel approach based on Budyko’s water and energy balance constraints. The approach is applied to quantify the degree of long‐term closure at the watershed scale, as well as its associated uncertainties, using an ensemble of global satellite data sets. We find large spatial variability across aridity, elevation, and other environmental gradients. Specifically, we find a positive correlation between elevation and closure uncertainty, as derived from the Budyko approach. In mountainous watersheds the uncertainty in closure is 3.9 ± 0.7 (dimensionless). Our results show that uncertainties in terrestrial evaporation contribute twice as much as precipitation uncertainties to errors in the closure of water and energy balance. Moreover, our results highlight the need for improving satellite‐based precipitation and evaporation data in humid temperate forests, where the closure error in the Budyko space is as high as 1.1 ± 0.3, compared to only 0.2 ± 0.03 in tropical forests. Comparing the results with land surface model‐based data sets driven by in situ precipitation, we find that Earth observation‐based data sets perform better in regions where precipitation gauges are sparse. These findings have implications for improving the understanding of global hydrology and regional water management and can guide the development of satellite remote sensing‐based data sets and Earth system models.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Research",
      "citations": 38,
      "abstract": "Understanding the dominant drivers of hydrological change is essential for water resources management. Watersheds in the United States are experiencing different types of changes (e.g., wet gets wetter and dry gets drier); however, few studies have analyzed what drivers are responsible for these changes, and how the dominant drivers vary over time and as a function of the climate/water regime and land cover. This study uses a time‐varying Budyko framework to quantify the relative importance of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and other factors (e.g., climate seasonality, agricultural drainage, and urbanization) in 889 watersheds in the contiguous United States from 1950 to 2009. Results show that watersheds that are getting wetter are primarily due to increases in precipitation. However, watersheds in dry climates that are getting drier are primarily due to other factors, while watersheds in wet climates that are getting drier are primarily due to precipitation. The drivers causing statistically significant streamflow trends vary depending on dominant land‐use types. Temporally, the increasing effects of other factors are more pronounced after the 1980s in the Midwest. The dominant drivers of streamflow in the United States are time‐varying instead of constant. This is consistent with non‐stationary patterns of streamflow. The time‐varying drivers provide information on the processes that are increasingly important and require the most attention in water resources management.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Research",
      "citations": 11,
      "abstract": "The available water for evaporation within a catchment is spatially variable. However, how the spatial variability of available water affects mean annual evaporation is not fully understood. For a specific catchment, a suitable distribution function defined for non‐negative random variables can be determined through statistical methods to represent the spatial variability of the available water when the point‐scale data are available. This article proposes that the distribution function representing the spatial variability of available water for evaporation determines the functional form of Budyko equation based on the one‐stage precipitation partitioning concept. Specifically, the available water for evaporation following a single‐parameter distribution function leads to a deterministic Budyko equation; whereas a two‐parameter distribution function of available water for evaporation leads to a single‐parameter Budyko equation. We identified the property of distribution function for symmetric Budyko equation, which suggests that precipitation partitioning and energy partitioning in the hydrological cycle follow the same functional form with respect to aridity index and humidity index, respectively. The lower bound of Budyko curve is explained as a result of probable distributions of available water for evaporation due to catchment co‐evolution.",

      "abstract": "Accurate estimation of the basin-specific parameter in the Budyko framework (e.g., parameter n in the Choudhury-Yang equation) is critical to quantify precipitation partitioning into evapotranspiration ( E ) and runoff. However, n is difficult to estimate due to complex interactions between the water balance and various environmental factors. In this study, we identified the controlling factors of n using random forest during 1981–2015 for 30 basins in the Loess Plateau of China. We then used the long short-term memory (LSTM) network combined with an 11-year moving window to develop a model to estimate time-varying n . This model was further incorporated into the Choudhury-Yang equation to simulate E . Our results showed that correlations between parameter n and environmental factors presented obvious spatial heterogeneity. Three land use type factors (i.e., the proportions of cropland, shrubland, and built-up land area), two climatic factors (i.e., precipitation and potential evapotranspiration), and a water use factor (i.e., irrigation water use) were identified as the controlling factors for n . Based on these controls, the LSTM model outperformed the traditional multiple linear regression model (MLR model) in estimating time-varying n , with root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.31/0.49 and coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0.88/0.67 for the LSTM/MLR model, respectively. Moreover, compared with the original Choudhury-Yang equation (using constant n calibrated by long-term average water balance), the improved equation (using time-varying n estimated by the LSTM) better reproduced the time series of water balance-based E . This study could enhance the applicability of the Budyko framework and provide scientific guidance for water resources management.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the effects of climate and catchment characteristics on hydrological behavior is critical in hydrological sciences. Furthermore, improving the clarity associated with the physical meaning of the Budyko hypothesis on how it can be incorporated into ecohydrological processes remains a significant challenge, while the conciseness it affords in addressing hydrological responses has promoted its application. This study explores the hydrological effects of the snow fraction ( f s ) and assesses the ecohydrological meaning of the catchment parameter ( n ) within the Budyko framework, employing 1576 globally investigated catchments. Results showed that the Budyko hypothesis decreased systematic errors (NS = 0.76, RMSE = 181.01 mm a −1 ) when incorporating the f s compared with no snow fraction incorporated it (NS = 0.54, RMSE = 248.85 mm a −1 ), especially for catchments with higher f s . In these catchments, a higher f s was generally consistent with a higher normalized mean streamflow ( Q ), while the opposite was true for normalized evaporation ( E / P ). Under the Budyko framework, n and f s distribution generally exhibited opposite trends. Moreover, higher n was mainly distributed near water limited and the highest energy limited boundaries, while higher f s represented lower ( P - Q )/ P ( i.e., the mean ( P - Q )/ P was 0.59, 0.57, and 0.38 for catchments with lower ( f s  0.12; ( iii ) the effective rooting depth ( Z e ) exhibited a complex regulatory effect on P partitioning; and ( iv ) α , Z e , and κ controlled n by 65%, 22%, and 13%, respectively, in all catchments. The ecohydrological processes incorporated into catchment parameters will broaden the ability of the Budyko hypothesis to describe hydrological behavior in a changing world, especially in the ungauged catchment.",

      "abstract": "Attribution analysis of runoff evolution under changing environmental conditions is currently a hot yet challenging topic in hydrology research. In this study, the Budyko method was used to quantitatively identify the effects of climate conditions and the underlying surface such as topography, land use and vegetation cover on the runoff changes in the Yellow River Basin during 1961–2018, and to clarify the spatial differences in the sensitivity and attribution of the runoff evolution by dividing the entire basin into sub-basins. The results show that the runoff was more sensitive to the underlying surface and precipitation changes than to the potential evaporation. The sensitivity coefficients decreased from upstream to downstream and the aridity index increased. The contribution rates of the climatic and the underlying surface changes to the runoff changes were 10.3–36.8% and 62.9–88.7%, respectively, and the underlying surface changes were the dominant factor causing the decrease in the runoff. Climate change led to increased runoff in the upper reaches and decreased runoff in the middle and lower reaches; while the underlying surface changes led to decreased runoff throughout the entire basin, especially in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. The quantified spatial differences in the runoff evolution attribution can help improve regional water resource management and provide theoretical support for studying the water cycle evolution mechanism in the Yellow River Basin.",

The performance of the proposed model was tested for 38 sub-basins in Iran representing various climate conditions, vegetation covers, and agricultural practices. The results demonstrated a good performance in terms of estimating streamflows at the basin outlet, with more than 90% of sub-basins having a correlation coefficient above 0.9.

      "abstract": "Predicting future streamflow change is essential for water resources management and understanding the impacts of projected climate and land use changes on water availability. The Budyko framework is a useful and computationally efficient tool to model streamflow at larger spatial scales. This study predicts future streamflow changes in 889 watersheds in the contiguous United States based on projected climate and land use changes from 2040 to 2069. The temporal variability of surface water balance controls, represented by the Budyko ω parameter, was modeled using multiple linear regression, random forest (RF), and gradient boosting. Results show that RF is the optimal model and can explain >85% of the variance in most watersheds. Relative cumulative moisture surplus, forest coverage, crop land and urban land are the most important variables of the time‐varying ω in most watersheds. There are statistically significant increases in mean annual precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and ω in 2040–2069, as compared to 1950–2005. This leads to a statistically significant decrease in the runoff ratio ( Q / P ). Streamflow is projected to decrease in the central, southwestern, and southeastern United States and increase in the northeast. These projections of water availability which are based on future climate and land use change scenarios can inform water resources management and adaptation strategies.",

      "citations": 12,
      "abstract": "During the last decades, significant changes in runoff ( Q ) have been reported in many regions, and attributing the changes is of great significance for water resource management. The conventionally used elasticity method based on the Budyko hypothesis neglects the impacts of climate seasonality on annual Q change (Δ Q ), and it is not yet well understood how the climate change and anthropogenic activities influence seasonal Q . Therefore, we propose a framework based on the ABCD model to explicitly identify the effects of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance on annual and seasonal Δ Q , and further apply it in 191 catchments across China from 1960 to 2000. The trend in annual Q exhibits a significant (α = 0.05) decreasing trend in most northern catchments and increasing trend in some catchments of the lower reaches of Yangtze River and Southeast Basin. The trend in seasonal Q in the northern catchments shows decreasing trend during all seasons, while most in the southern catchments shows increasing trend especially in summer. Regarding the causes for annual Δ Q , climate change has positive and negative effects in 60 % and 40 % catchments, respectively, and is the dominant factor in the catchments of the Yangtze River Basin, Southeast Basin and Pearl River Basin. Human activities have positive and negative effects in 20 % and 80 % catchments, respectively, and are the dominant factor in north China. Precipitation is the dominant climatic driver in 72 % catchments. For the causes for seasonal Δ Q , climate change increases Q in southeastern catchments during all seasons, while it decreases Q in northern catchments during autumn and winter. Human activities decrease Q in more than half of the catchments except in winter. The climate seasonality cannot be ignored and our proposed framework is superior to the elasticity method in capturing the impacts of climate seasonality on Δ Q. The elasticity method causes more than 5 % deviation of the contribution ratio of climate change to Δ Q in 48 catchments. In addition, this framework is reliable on multi-annual timescales and provides important reference for water resource management.",

      "citations": 11,
      "abstract": "Researchers seek improved models for estimating baseflow in ungauged catchments as the statistical and process-based methods traditionally used are not easily transferable and do not give robust predictions, respectively. In this study, a process-based statistical hybrid model for estimating baseflow, known here as the Budyko-type baseflow regression (BBR) model, was developed by combining the linear storage-discharge relationship with the Budyko function, and applying multiple regression. The performance of the hybrid model was then evaluated using data from 671 near-natural catchments acquired from four large-sample hydrometeorological datasets. The results showed that the BBR model performed well in estimating baseflow on both national and regional scales; the coefficient of determination between the observed and predicted mean annual baseflow varied from 0.85 to 0.94 for the calibration catchments and from 0.71 to 0.96 for the validation catchments. The BBR model has more of a physical basis, is more transferable, and is less likely to produce unrealistic (negative) mean annual baseflows than traditional multiple regression models. It is also less complex than process-based models. The calibrated BBR models were used to estimate the mean annual baseflow and the elasticity of the baseflow to climate and catchment attributes at the national scale for the United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, and Australia. The results showed that climate (precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) had the most control on the baseflow, and that the soil sand content and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index were also important catchment attributes. The BBR model developed in this study offers scientists a new and improved method for estimating baseflow. The results generated by the model in this study will improve our understanding of how climate and landscape control the baseflow.",

We used three Budyko-based models (Turc-Pike, Zhang, Fu) with and without the concept of effective precipitation scenarios. The effective precipitation and model parameters were determined together during the calibration processes. The effective precipitation-based approach improved the model performance in predicting the annual water balance in most of the River Vistula catchment.

      "abstract": "Climate change intensification (e.g., long-term drought) dramatically triggers catchment property changes, which introduces larger uncertainties for describing catchment hydrological behavior. In this study, hydrological behavior responses to multiyear drought were explored, and then causes were explained. The hydrological response to multiyear drought was explored using a magnitude of shift ( M ) in describing the relationship between precipitation ( P ) and streamflow ( Q ) in different catchment states, and a novel method, the trigonometric function decomposition method within the Budyko framework (the TFD method), was applied to assess the causes of Q changes. Several conclusions can be drawn: ( i ) multiyear drought mainly caused insignificant and significant upward ( p < 0.05) changes in the P–Q relationship among 95.45 % of the studied catchments ( p < 0.05); ( ii ) more server drying, lower leaf area index (LAI) and slope can induce a higher M via multiyear drought. In particular, catchment water storage, indicated by the deep soil layer in the Loess Plateau, can effectively mitigate the Q reduction and resulted in a 77.27 % (17/22) upward shift compared with the expected Q reduction; ( iii ) an asymmetric effect was caused by a multiyear P deficit, that is, ( P-Q )/ P increase and catchment property parameter ( n ) decrease were induced by the increases in ratio between potential evapotranspiration and P ( E p / P ), suggesting that the catchment properties can mitigate the Q reduction; and ( iv ) catchment properties had negative effects on the Q reduction (7.76 mm a −1 ), and partially offset Q reduction (−21.32 mm a −1 ) resulted from climate change during the multiyear drought period. All of these results indicated that multiyear drought triggered Q reduction, while catchment behavior in the changeable induction mechanism induced a nonlinear Q response to P reduction, which is important for accurate Q projections and appropriate adaptation strategies for droughts.",

      "abstract": "Accurate assessment of changes in water availability with changing climate is vital for effective mitigation and adaptation. In this research, we employ a parsimonious Budyko curve method to evaluate changes in water availability under low‐ (SSP126) and high‐emission (SSP585) scenarios for 331 river basins in the contiguous United States. We also assess the relative role of changes in precipitation (∆P) and potential evapotranspiration (∆PET) with changing climate on the increase in water availability vulnerability. Results highlight that around 43% (28%) of basins are projected to experience increased vulnerability to changing climate in high‐emission (low‐emission) scenarios. Sub‐humid basins are most often impacted, while arid and semi‐arid basins exhibit lower sensitivity to changes. Intriguingly, ∆PET emerges as the dominant control on vulnerability, surpassing ∆P, particularly under SSP585 scenario. The analysis prompts water managers to focus on long‐term mitigation planning and scientists to further constraint climate and water budget forecasts in affected basins.",

      "abstract": "Clean, reliable supplies of water are critical to the sustainability and resilience of communities, including water needed for energy and food production, industry, drinking water, and other human and ecological needs. However, water infrastructure and management in the United States are largely optimized for historic conditions—designed and operated to respond to social needs, and past mean and extreme streamflow, which may no longer apply in the future. Temperature, precipitation, ecosystem dynamics, energy and food production, and social systems are all experiencing changes, which cumulatively affect the security of water supply. Here, we examine the impact of these changes in a provisioning basin in the arid Southwest, the San Juan River, which supplies water, food, and energy to the Colorado River and the Rio Grande. Our analysis applies a multi-model framework to examine future climate and water use scenarios. Results demonstrate that the San Juan River basin could experience significant disruptions to water deliveries (− 12% to− 48% for the drier models) and shortages that exceed manageable thresholds (53% to 73% of water in shorted years), potentially affecting both the local basin as well as other regions that receive water and energy from the San Juan. While water stress metrics vary across the scenarios, results indicate the need for government, industry, and communities to consider options for adapting to water supply shifts. These results raise important questions regarding the resilience of water resources in basins across the West under future scenarios and implications for energy, food, and other water supply needs.",

Study focus We investigated the projected changes in water availability and demand across the Red River to identify regions of potential future water stress. The VIC model was calibrated, validated and then run with ensemble forcing from regionally representative global circulation model (GCM) outputs. For different combinations of representative concentration pathways (RCPs) we evaluated the impacts of climate change on streamflows and water availability throughout the basin. To estimate future water demand, we integrated a series of sector-specific regression models fit to historical water usage per county. New hydrological insights for the region Despite discrepancies among GCMs projections, all future scenarios include a strong west-east gradient in water availability. Joint consideration of projected water demand and availability reveals that the distribution of future hotspots of water stress is spatially patchy and generally driven by changes in water demand, rather than availability. These hotspots of future water stress highlight locations of potential water conflicts. Our approach is likely to be applicable to drought-prone river basins worldwide where the spatial patterns of future water availability differ from spatial patterns of future water demand.",

      "abstract": "Water resources allocation is facing great challenge, since hydrological series have shown non-stationarity with high uncertainty due to climate change and human activities. Adaptive measures are suggested to respond to the challenge. Aiming at quantitatively assess the impact of adaptive measures on optimal water resources allocation, we proposed a framework based on reliability, resilience and vulnerability indicators. Two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP4.5) of one global climate model were used to project future climate, and the variable infiltration capacity hydrological model was used to simulate streamflow. Three adaptive measures [water saving measure, water transfer project, dynamic control of flood limiting water levels (FLWLs) for reservoir operation] were combined to eight scenarios, then scenarios were applied to the allocation model to get different optimal allocation schemes which were assessed by RRV indicators. The results show that water saving measure decreases the vulnerability by 79 × 10 6 m 3 , water transfer project decreases the resilience by 17% in every scenario and dynamic control of FLWLs increases the reliability by 23.53% to the greatest scale. But the impacts of latter two adaptive measures are restricted to the areas which are geographically close to water supply projects. The uneven spatial distribution and decrease of streamflow will increase the risk of water shortage in the future. Optimal water allocation can reduce this risk and make 23 of 28 operational zones stable. Water saving measure is significantly valid in the rest 5 operational zones, but its impact is not positive to all water use sectors. Overall, our study helps understanding the interaction between adaptive measures and water resources system, and making guidelines for effective adaptation planning.",

      "abstract": "General circulation models (GCMs), used for climate change projections, should be able to simulate both the temporal variability and spatial patterns of the observed climate. However, the selection of GCMs in most previous studies was either based on temporal variability or mean spatial pattern of past climate. In this study, a framework is proposed for the selection of GCMs based on their ability to reproduce the spatial patterns for different climate variables. The Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) was used to assess GCMs ability to simulate the annual spatial patterns of maximum and minimum temperatures (Tmx and Tmn, respectively) and rainfall depth. The mean and standard deviation of KGEs were used as performance indicators to present the GCMs' overall skill. Finally, the global performance indicator was used as a multi-criteria decision-making approach to integrate the results of different climate variables and seasons in order to rank the GCMs. Egypt was considered as a case study. The results revealed the better performance, in order, of the MRI-CGCM3, followed by FGOALS-g2, GFDL-ESM2G, GFDL-CM3 and lastly MPI-ESM-MR over Egypt. The final set of GCMs showed a similar spatial pattern for the projected change in temperature over Egypt. For different scenarios, Tmx was projected to increase in the range of 1.63–4.2 C while the increase in Tmn ranged between 1.28 and 4.43 C. A projected increase in temperature in winter is likely greater than in summer. The selected models also projected a 62% decrease in rainfall depth over the northern coastline where rain is currently most abundant while an increase in the dry southern zones. The rise in temperature and decrease in rainfall depth could have severe implications for a country with dwindling water resources.",

      "abstract": "The Pyrenees are the main source of water for a large region in Southern Europe. In recent decades, streamflow and snow accumulation in these mountains have decreased, and climate models predict that further reductions in water will threaten the sustainability of downstream regions. This article presents a cascading multi-model and multi-scenario approach to assess how future climate change may affect the hydrology and water management of Pyrenees-dependent systems. In particular, we combined future climate projections and management scenarios and applied them to the Gállego-Cinca River System in the Ebro River Basin of Spain. We developed a hydrologic model for the headwaters of this system (the source of most of the water), and then used a management model to simulate reservoir operation and water allocation among the different agricultural demand units of this system, the largest irrigated region in Spain. We assessed future headwater streamflow for 22 climate models, and translated this climate signal into a management model by using a delta change approach. Finally, we evaluated the performance and sustainability of the system with indicators based on the frequency, duration, and magnitude of the supply deficit. The results show that use of the current planned management scenarios will threaten to the system’s future sustainability, especially for irrigated agriculture. These results indicate a need to revise current water resource planning strategies in this region, and to establish long-term, robust, and sustainable measures for adaptation to climate change.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 34,
      "abstract": "In a rapidly changing environment, analysis of risks associated with non-stationary hydroclimatic extremes has many important implications for resilient and sustainable water resources management, including the evaluation of risk for existing systems and the design of new infrastructure. This study develops a new risk-based analytical framework called the Non-Stationary Monte-Carlo (NSMC) to better address various problems associated with non-stationarity of hydrologic extremes. Current approaches in the literature evaluating non-stationary Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) of extremes events commonly use trend extension or multivariate analysis based on observed data, which often fail to account for larger changes in the future. To avoid these problems, NSMC explicitly accounts for the projected changes in hydroclimatic extremes by analyzing the changing PDFs of extremes for each future year based on statistically downscaled climate projections and hydrologic simulations. Using Monte Carlo techniques, NSMC generates a Super Ensemble (SE) of extremes, the statistics of which can be readily applied to various problems in non-stationary flood frequency analysis. For example, we show that the estimation of design standards based on Design Life Level (DLL) or Average Risk of Failure (ARF) metrics can be reduced to a simple look-up process of quantiles in the SE of extremes. A case study analyzing extreme high streamflow and a hypothetical levee design for the Wabash basin (IN, USA) demonstrates the applicability of NSMC to real-world flood risk problems. Furthermore, this study also shows an example case of using NSMC to identify cost-effective design standards for new infrastructure combining future changing risk of failure, project design lifespan, and present value of future replacement costs.",

      "abstract": "Vegetation plays an important role in the energy exchange, water cycle, carbon cycle, biogeochemical cycle, and maintenance of surface ecosystems. In recent years, regional vegetation cover has changed significantly. This study used statistical analyses, including the Mann-Kendall trend test, the Hurst exponent, and Pettitt test, to analyze the characteristics of temporal and spatial variation of vegetation coverage in the Xijiang River basin from 2000 to 2013. The results showed that vegetation coverage of 98.76% of the Xijiang River basin is weakly variable (Cv < 0.1). The area with significantly increased vegetation accounts for 43.45% of the total area ( p < = 0.05). A total of 19.47% of vegetation coverage in the Xijiang River basin had significant change-points from 2004 to 2008 ( p < = 0.05), and the area of concave change-points accounted for 25.99% of the total area of point increased the vegetation coverage. At an altitude of 500–2000 m, the altitude has an inhibitory effect on vegetation coverage. When the slope is less than 35 degrees, the slope has a promoting effect on vegetation coverage. Rich precipitation resources are the main source of soil water supply, and higher temperature provides better thermal energy resources, which may have a significant impact on vegetation growth in the future and cause time lag effects of climatic factors on vegetation coverage. The vegetation coverage and the area affected by the precipitation and temperature (time lag factors) accounted for 32.99% and 31.47% of the total watershed, respectively. The correlation between climatic factors, topographic factors, and vegetation coverage increased over time. The results from this study will help to further deepen the understanding of vegetation cover and its influencing factors, and provide a scientific basis for ecological restoration projects such as vegetation restoration in the Xijiang River basin of China.",

      "abstract": "Assessing flood risk using stationary flood frequency analysis techniques is commonplace. However, it is increasingly evident that the stationarity assumption of these analyses does not hold as anthropogenic climate change could shift a site’s hydroclimate beyond the range of historical behaviors. We employ nonstationary flood frequency models using the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution to model changing flood risk for select seasons at twelve National Parks across the U.S. In this GEV model, the location and/or scale parameters of the distribution are allowed to change as a function of time-variable covariates. We use historical precipitation and modeled flows from the Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC), a land-surface model that simulates land–atmosphere fluxes using water and energy balance equations, as covariates to fit a best nonstationary GEV model to each site. We apply climate model projections of precipitation and VIC flows to these models to obtain future flood probability estimates. Our model results project a decrease in flood risk for sites in the southwestern U.S. region and an increase in flood risk for sites in northern and eastern regions of the U.S. for the selected seasons. The methods and results presented will enable the NPS to develop strategies to ensure public safety and efficient infrastructure management and planning in a nonstationary climate.",

      "citations": 49,
      "abstract": "Projecting the likely change of potential evapotranspiration (ETp) under future climate scenarios is crucial for quantifying the impacts of climate change on the hydrologic cycle and aridity conditions. However, there are different sources of uncertainty in projecting future ETp that may arise from global climate models (GCMs), emission scenarios, and multiple ETp models used. In this study, we developed three random forest-based (RF-based) ETp models with solar radiation and air temperature at eight climatic stations in southeastern Australia. With Penman model as the benchmark, their performance was firstly compared with four empirical models (Jensen-Haise, Makkink, Abtew, and Hargreaves), which requires the same meteorological inputs. In general, the RF-based ETp models showed better performance in ETp estimates across all stations, with coefficients of determination (R 2 ) ranging from 0.68 to 0.92, root mean square errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.58 mm day −1 to 1.46 mm day −1 , and relative mean bias errors (rMBE) ranging from −16.10% to 9.73%. The RF-based and empirical models were then used to project future ETp for the eight stations based on statistically downscaled daily climatic data from 34 GCMs under two different representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). All models indicated that ETp was likely to increase at the eight stations. The ensemble increases of mean ETp across eight stations ranged from 33 mm year −1 (2.1%, 2040s) to 129 mm year −1 (9.2%, 2090s) and from 43 mm year −1 (2.8%, 2040s) to 248 mm year −1 (17.6%, 2090s) under RCP4.5 and under RCP8.5, respectively. In addition, we also quantified uncertainties in ETp projections originating from ETp models, GCMs, RCPs, and their combined effects using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method. Results showed that RCP-related uncertainty contributed the most to projected ETp uncertainty (around 40% for most stations) while GCM-related and ETp model-related uncertainties accounted for roughly equal amounts of projected ETp uncertainty (10%–30%). This study demonstrated the better performance of RF-based ETp models. It is advisable to use multiple ETp models driven by various GCMs under different RCPs to produce reliable projections of future ETp.",

      "journal": "Water",
      "citations": 10,
      "abstract": "The hydrologic nonstationarity and uncertainty associated with climate change requires new decision-making methods to incorporate climate change impacts into flood frequency and flood risk analyses. To aid decision-making under climate change, we developed a bottom-up approach for assessing the performance of flood management systems under climate uncertainty and nonstationarity. The developed bottom-up approach was applied to the American River, CA, USA flood management system by first identifying the sensitivity and vulnerability of the system to different climates. To do this, we developed a climate response surface by calculating and plotting Expected Annual Damages (EAD, $/year) under different flood regimes. Next, we determined a range of plausible future climate change and flood frequency scenarios by applying Bayesian statistical methods to projected future flows derived from a Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model forced with Global Circulation Model (GCM) output. We measured system robustness as the portion of plausible future scenarios under which the current flood system could meet its performance goal. Using this approach, we then evaluated the robustness of four proposed management strategies in the 2012 Central Valley Flood Protection Plan in terms of both flood risk and cost-effectiveness, to assess the performance of the strategies in the face of climate risks. Results indicated that the high sensitivity of the expected damages to changes in flood regimes makes the system extremely vulnerable to a large portion of the plausible range of future flood conditions. The management strategy that includes a combination of nature-based flood management actions along with engineered structures yields the greatest potential to increase system robustness in terms of maintaining EAD below an acceptable risk threshold. However, this strategy still leaves the system vulnerable to a wide range of plausible future conditions. As flood frequency regimes increase in intensity from the current conditions, the cost-effectiveness of the management strategies increases, to a point, before decreasing. This bottom up analysis demonstrated a viable decision-making approach for water managers in the face of uncertain and changing future conditions. Neglecting to use such an approach and omitting climate considerations from water resource planning could lead to strategies that do not perform as expected or which actually lead to mal-adaptations, increasing vulnerability to climate change.",

      "abstract": "The looming impacts of changing climate and ever increasing water and energy demands make it important to quantify expected water and energy availabilities and develop strategies to mitigate expected shortfalls. Keeping these aspects in mind, in this paper, hydrological modeling is performed on the Upper Yangtze River Basin (UYRB) to simulate the inflows to the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) based on the Hydrologic Engineering Center’s Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) model and a Multiple-input single-output Linear Systematic Model (MLSM). These models are derived for historical (1960–2005) and future (near: 2021–2050 and far: 2061–2090) time periods using bias corrected climate projections from an ensemble of 6 RCMs available through the COordinated Regional Downscaling EXperiment in East Asia (CORDEX-EA) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5. Simulating with and without snow, hydrological responses to both the historical and future climates are fed into a daily reservoir simulation model where the operation of the TGR follows the designed operating rule curves which can be regarded as a standard operating policy (SOP). The results indicate marginal reduction in mean annual precipitation, inflow and hydropower generation and mean hydropower generation reliability for the future scenarios under RCP 8.5 with the decreases for far future being more prominent than those for near future. The inflow decreases strongly reduce the hydropower generation of the TGR in November and May and have limited impact on other months because of the regulation ability of the SOP. Hydropower generation responses to extreme variations in annual inflow are projected to aggravate the water and energy security stress of the TGR. The without snow projections alter the inflow patterns as well as the hydropower generation patterns of the TGR with respect to the with snow projections and are likely to have positive impact on the water impounding and hydropower generation for both the historical and future time periods.",

      "citations": 5,
      "abstract": "The increasing flood risks in the Bago River due to rapid urbanization and climate change have great implications on the local development and quality of life in the basin. Therefore, the current flood hazard and potential future changes in flooding due to climate change must be assessed. This study investigates the potential flood frequency change in the Bago River and its sensitivity to the bias-correction method used in climate projections from the downscaled Global Climate Model (GCM) output. A pseudo-global warming method using MIROC5 RCP 8.5 was employed to produce 12-km 30-y historical and future climate projections. Empirical quantile mapping (EQM), gamma quantile mapping (GQM), and the multiplicative scaling method (SCM) were used for biascorrecting the rainfall input of the water-energy budget distributed hydrological model (WEB-DHM). The impacts of bias-correction methods used in reproducing the annual maximum series in the frequency analysis are sensitive to the trend of potential future changes in flood discharge frequency estimation. All methods exhibited decreases in the flood peak discharge for 50-yr and 100-yr flood predictions, which may primarily be due to the MIROC5 GCM used. However, the variation in the magnitude of the change is wide. This demonstrates the uncertainty of the frequency analysis for flood magnitude due to the employed biascorrection method. This uncertainty has significant implications on risk quantification conducted using downscaled climate projections. The effect of the uncertainty of the bias-correction method on the annual maximum rainfall time series should be communicated properly when conducting risk and hazard assessment studies.",

      "citations": 27,
      "abstract": "This study develops a new method for selecting the most representative climate model for use in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and evaluates this method in the Maumee River Basin. Downscaled temperature and precipitation data from 32 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models were used to drive the SWAT. Our model selection approach uses a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impacts of temperature and precipitation on streamflow and to determine the optimal weights for both variables. This weighting scheme is then used to rank the performance of all climate models and identify which ones are most representative of climate forcing required by the hydrological model. The results of our sensitivity analysis indicate that the response of streamflow to precipitation is consistent throughout the year, while the response to temperature is more complex. During the warm season, higher temperatures cause evapotranspiration to increase and streamflow to decrease; during the cool season, higher temperatures cause more snowmelt and this causes streamflow to increase. Based on our weighting scheme, the GISS-E2-R was identified as the most representative climate model in the Maumee River Basin. We then compared the performance of SWAT-simulated streamflow using all CMIP5 models. The most representative climate model ranked first based on correlation and mean absolute error, and second based on Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, while the model selected using a simple average method was ranked fifth, fourth and twelfth, respectively. Based on the evaluation of other key variables, such as sediment transport, nitrogen and phosphorus, the optimal climate model also has a higher correlation and a more representative standard deviation than the other CMIP5 models. The selected model also performs better than the 32-model ensemble mean based on correlation and Taylor’s skill score. When applying this method at different time scales, the responding time of streamflow to climate factors needs to be considered. The model selection method that was developed in this paper can be applied by hydrological modelers to select the most representative climate models for evaluating the impacts of climate change in other watersheds around the world.",

      "abstract": "To characterize future drought events over a drought prone area like South Asia is paramount for drought risk mitigation. In this paper, a five-model ensemble mean from CMIP6 was chosen to project drought characteristics in South Asia under the latest SSPs-RCPs emission scenarios (SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5, and SSP5–8.5) for the period 2020–2099. Additionally, corresponding scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 of CMIP5 were used for comparison and to identify the changes and improvements of CMIP6 over the South Asia. Principle Component Analysis and the Varimax rotation method is used to divided the study area into five homogenous drought sub-regions. Drought duration, frequency, and intensity are analyzed based on the Run theory, and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at 12-months timescale, and the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (sc-PDSI). The Modified Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope method is adopted to detect sub-regional trends in drought characteristics. Results show that significant increases in drought conditions mainly pronounced over the North-West sub-region. Strong increases are projected in the average drought duration and drought frequency. The North-West sub-region is the most vulnerable to face frequent drought events with longer duration with higher intensity. Parts of the South-West, North-Central, and North-East sub-regions will also face more adverse drought conditions in future. The selected model ensemble from CMIP6 has a very robust capability to simulate present climate parameters (precipitation, temperature, and evaporation) and satisfactorily captures drought characteristics in South Asia. These results provide a basis for developing drought adaptation measures for South Asia.",

      "citations": 7,
      "abstract": "Climate Impact Response Functions (CIRFs) can be useful for exploring potential risks of system failure under climate change. The performance of a water resource system can be synthesized through a CIRF that relates climate conditions to system behavior in terms of a specified threshold of deliveries to demands or environmental flow requirements. However, in highly regulated water resource systems this relationship may be quite complex, depending on storage capacity and system operation. In this paper we define a CIRF for these types of systems through a multivariable logistic regression (LR) model where a binary variable (system response) is explained by two continuous variables or predictors (precipitation and temperature). The approach involves generating multivariate synthetic inflow time series and relating them to specific climate conditions. Next, these inflows are used as inputs in a water management model, and the outcome is coded as a binary variable (failure or its absence) depending on selected vulnerability criteria. To identify the time span before the failure event in which climate variables are relevant, we characterized drought development stages through relative standardized indices. Mean values of precipitation and temperature for the selected time span are computed and used as explanatory variables through a LR model, which is validated using data from several climate models and scenarios. Results show that the predictive capacity of LR models is acceptable, so that they could be used as screening tools to detect challenging climate conditions for the system which would require adaption actions.",

      "abstract": "Variations of precipitation, temperature, and runoff in the Yellow River source region were analyzed with the Mann–Kendall and Spearman rank correlation tests over the past 60 years. Based on the seven climate scenarios from CMIP5 climate models under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, responses of hydrological process to climate change were simulated using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. Variation analysis results indicated that recorded temperature presented significant increasing trend. Daily minimum temperature presented higher increasing trend than daily maximum temperature. Annual gross precipitation presented minor increasing and annual runoff presented minor decreasing. The VIC model performed well on simulating monthly discharge at Tangnaihai station, with NSE of 0.91 and 0.93 in calibration and validation periods, respectively. The projected annual mean temperature would rise (with 25th and 75th percentiles) 1.07–1.32 °C, 1.76–2.33 °C, 3.45–4.29 °C, annual precipitation is expected to increase 3.43%–11.77%, 8.05%–17.27%, 12.84%–27.89%, and runoff would moderately increase with high variability of 0.82%–14.26%, −3.41%–19.14%, 1.43%–38.26% relative to the baseline of 1961–1990 under each RCP in the 2080s, respectively. The inhomogeneity of runoff may increase in the future. Many more droughts and floods under climate change may threaten social development in this region in the future.",

      "abstract": "The Lancang-Mekong River Basin (LMRB) is one of the most important transboundary river basins in Asia. While climate change perturbs the streamflow and affects flood events, reservoir operation may mitigate or aggravate this impact. Therefore, quantitative assessment of the climate change impact and reservoir effect on the LMRB is a vital prerequisite for future hydropower development and environmental protection. This study aimed to estimate the variation of the streamflow and flood characteristics affected by climate change and reservoir operation within the LMRB. A reservoir module was incorporated into the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to simulate the streamflow susceptible to the reservoirs. It was found that the reservoirs had a substantial influence on the streamflow during 2008–2016, when many reservoirs were constructed in the LMRB. The reservoirs across the Lancang River (the upper Mekong River located in China) reduced the annual average streamflow by 5% at Chiang Sean station (northern Thailand) in 2008–2016, whereas their influence became undetectable downstream of Vientiane station (northern Laos). The streamflow changes downstream of Mukdahan station at southern Laos (including the stations in Cambodia and southern Vietnam) were mainly attributed to the local reservoirs and climate change. Compared with the baseline period of 1985–2007, the upstream reservoir operation dramatically affected streamflow at the midstream stations with higher dry season streamflow (+15% to +37%), but lower wet season streamflow was less affected (−2% to −24%) in 2008–2016. Climate change increased the magnitude and frequency of the flood by up to 14% and 45%, respectively, whereas the reservoir operation reduced them by 16% and 36%, respectively. Our findings provide insights into the interaction between climate change and reservoir operation and their integrated effects on the streamflow, informing and supporting water management and hydropower development in the LMRB.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 77,
      "abstract": "Streamflow has been complexly altered by climate change and human activities in major rivers worldwide. The traditional Darwinian approach for impact assessment of climate change and human activities mainly focuses on variations in annual streamflow, but ignores other critical streamflow characteristics (e.g., high- and low-flow signatures). In our study, seven streamflow metrics were adopted to characterize the main streamflow signatures including average, low and high flows, and the Budyko-based method was extended based on the derived differential equation of streamflow signature change to separate individual impacts of climate change and human activities. The Yellow River Basin, China was selected as the study area because of its high intensity of human activities, and daily runoff observation series from 1960 to 2015 at four stations from the source region to the downstream region were used for the assessment. The assessment results were also compared with those estimated by the hydrological modeling method for validation. The results show that all streamflow signatures at the four stations have evidently declined after the 1980s, particularly for high-flow magnitudes. Both climate change and human activities decrease most of streamflow signatures, and human activities play major roles, which are gradually enhanced from the source region to the downstream region. The contributions of human activities are from −66.85% to −56.68% in the Tangnaihai controlled catchment, from −96.93% to −54.59% in the Qingtongxia controlled catchment, from −83.61% to −57.49% in the Longmen controlled catchment, and from −91.02% to −57.29% in the Lijin controlled catchment. The most impacted signature is the average flow in the non-flood season, followed by the annual maximum flow. The estimated contributions of climate change and human activities match well with those estimated by the hydrological modeling method, particularly for the high- and average-flow signatures with contribution deviations less than 10%. However, the estimated contributions to the low-flow signatures are quite different likely due to large uncertainty of low flow estimation. This study is expected to provide insights into the streamflow variations basin wide and provide scientific foundations for ecological protection and high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin, China.",

      "abstract": "Climate change and human activities have been widely recognized as two major factors that deeply influenced hydrological processes. It has great importance to evaluate and identify the contributions among distinct driving factors, which could help carry out better regional water resources management regulation. In this study, we used the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to quantify the contributions for different climatic variables and human activities to runoff in the Luanhe River basin (LRB) with semi-arid climate, northern China. Our intention is to detect the multiple impacts of climate change ( CC ), such as precipitation change ( PC ) and temperature rising ( TR ), and human activities ( HA ), including land use/ cover change ( LUCC ) and direct human activities (i.e., water withdrawal and inter-basin water diversion, DHA ), on runoff variance. The “natural period” (1961–1979), “weak impact period” (1980–1997) and “strong impact period” (1998–2016) were divided based on the double-mass curves and Mann-Kendall’s test of observed runoff data from 1961 to 2016. The results indicated that, 1) compared with climate change, human activities were the major factors decreasing the runoff, which contributed more than 60% to the runoff reduction in two impact periods; 2) the runoff variation affected by climate was ruled by the precipitation change positively and strongly, and the impacts of precipitation and temperature strengthened with time. 3) During the strong impact period, the direct human activities have presented the most contribution on runoff reduction, which may result from the water diversion and water withdrawal. The influence of LUCC on runoff was mainly due to the conversion between grassland and cropland. These results would be helpful for policymakers and researchers to better understand the responses of runoff to this changing environment conditions and provide implications for future water resources planning and management at the basin scale.",

      "abstract": "Separating the individual effects of climate variability and human activities on streamflow is more important than just knowing their combined effects. In this paper, using a scenario-based hydrological simulation approach, the streamflow changes caused by climate variability and two different types of human activities (i.e. land-use change and large reservoirs operations) as well as the contribution rates of these three factors over 272 sub-basins in the Yangtze river basin were quantified and compared among 5 different periods (i.e. 1988–1992 (P1), 1993–1997 (P2), 1998–2002 (P3), 2003–2007 (P4) and 2008–2012 (P5)). Results demonstrate that, at the annual scale, climate variability played a leading role in the change in outflow of most sub-basins. With regard to the seasonal variations in discharge at Datong station, climate factors played a predominant role during P1-P2 and P2-P3. Since the Three Gorges Reservoir began operating in 2003, the discharge was enhanced by reservoirs in January-May and reduced by reservoirs in July-December. Reservoir and climate factors codetermined seasonal streamflow change during P3-P4 and P4-P5. Land-use change made the smallest contribution to seasonal discharge fluctuations.

      "abstract": "Global climate change is presenting a variety of challenges to hydrology and water resources because it strongly affects the hydrologic cycle, runoff, and water supply and demand. In this study, we assessed the effects of climate change scenarios on hydrological variables (i.e., evapotranspiration and runoff) by linking the outputs from the global climate model (GCM) with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for a case study in the Lijiang River Basin, China. We selected a variety of bias correction methods and their combinations to correct the lower resolution GCM outputs of both precipitation and temperature. Then, the SWAT model was calibrated and validated using the observed flow data and corrected historical GCM with the optimal correction method selected. Hydrological variables were simulated using the SWAT model under emission scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. The results demonstrated that correcting methods have a positive effect on both daily precipitation and temperature, and a hybrid method of bias correction contributes to increased performance in most cases and scenarios. Based on the bias corrected scenarios, precipitation annual average, temperature, and evapotranspiration will increase. In the case of precipitation and runoff, projection scenarios show an increase compared with the historical trends, and the monthly distribution of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff shows an uneven distribution compared with baseline. This study provides an insight on how to choose a proper GCM and bias correction method and a helpful guide for local water resources management.",

      "abstract": "Water, food, energy, climate change and land subsystems are closely intertwined, and play remarkable roles in regional resources management system. Quantification of connections, synergies, and tradeoffs across these subsystems is needed in a more integrated and comprehensive manner, which is challenging due to the complexities and uncertainties involved therein. This paper proposed an inexact optimization approach from a novel w ater-f o od-ene r gy-c l imate change-lan d (WORLD) nexus perspective, which has potential to promote social-economic development, guarantee livelihood security, and achieve low-carbon target. The approach is capable of (1) helping decision makers identify optimal policy alternatives among water, land, and energy, balancing economic benefit, water supply guarantee rate, hydroelectric generation, water-land utilization, crop yield, and greenhouse gas emission, via a multi-objective non-linear optimization model; (2) providing decision makers insights into in-depth analysis of optimal water-land resources allocation strategies associated with different levels of water supply, optimistic-pessimistic attitude, and climate change and where the effort could be made towards regional sustainability; (3) dealing with fuzzy uncertainties simultaneously occurring in objective functions and constraints as well as tracking fluctuating attitudes of decision-makers. The effectiveness of proposed model was verified in a real-world case in Zhanghe Irrigation District, Hubei Province, China. The changing range of economic benefit, crop yield, energy production, and environmental impacts were obtained based on optimal water-land resources allocation under different confidence levels and risk attitudes. Results under climate change scenarios show that climate change exacerbated local water shortage, especially in RCP 8.5, which requires 4.24 × 10 8 m 3 of compensatory external water. Results also show that CO 2 emission contributed 94.9% of GHGs emission, while fertilizers application contributed to 58% of total CO 2 emission amount, calling for effective fertilizer utilization management. Compared with single objective models, proposed model performs better on providing coordinated policy solutions.

      "abstract": "Both climate change and anthropogenic activities are known to induce streamflow change. It is important to understand how it works. Here we integrate the long-term water balance equation with the Budyko framework to analytically attribute the mean annual streamflow change to changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration caused by climate change, and to changes in watershed properties caused by anthropogenic activities. The attribution approach is applied to six sub-basins in Mekong River basin as a case study for attributing the decadal change in streamflow during 1960–2018 over the baseline (1960–1969). Results indicate that the observed streamflow decadal changes are mostly due to anthropogenic activities with some decadal contributions from changes in precipitation. The rapid rate of water infrastructure (e.g., dams) development has been reported there. The streamflow record and the attribution approach described here can be used to explicitly unravel the climatic and anthropogenic drivers of the hydrologic cycle.",

      "abstract": "This work provides a comprehensive analysis of soil water dynamics in Australia for the climate projections of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). We modelled the historical soil water dynamics from 1981 to 2018 at various depths within and below the root zone using the BRTSim computational solver to generate the \"current conditions\". We then investigated how the CMIP6 scenario can affect water accessibility by plants, and hence their potential impact on croplands and native ecosystems. We found that surface soil moisture can decline by 7% across Australia between 2020 and 2050, with the 2030 decade projected to experience the greatest soil water loss. Above-average precipitation during the 2040s will still lead to 2% soil moisture decline relative to current conditions, with about 1 million km 2 projected to recover from this deficit later on. Seasonally, our results inferred drier summers and winters with 13% and 5% loss in soil water, respectively. Shrublands and savannas were the most affected native ecosystems with a moisture decline between 16% and 7% within the root zone, respectively. More importantly, 36% to 52% of croplands were found to undergo a 7% decline in soil moisture within the root zone, which was spatially and temporally heterogeneous across crop types. Within the crop calendar, wheat-growing regions were affected by soil moisture deficiencies from sowing to harvest in almost the entire time frame of our assessment.",

      "abstract": "This study assesses changes in low flow seasonality in response to climate change using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models. The precipitation-runoff modelling system (PRMS) model was applied to project future streamflow using 13 global climate models (GCMs) under two emissions scenarios (representative concentration pathway [RCP] 4.5 and RCP8. 5). Then, daily projected streamflows for each month in the reference and future periods were used to assess the monthly variation in low flows in Korean river basins. The results showed that high seasonal variation exists in low flows during the wet and dry seasons, including increasing low flows during the dry season and decreasing low flows during the wet season. The low flows are projected to decrease during the wet season by− 6.48% in the 2025 period and by− 2.59% in the 2085 period under RCP4. 5. Under RCP8. 5, the low flow is projected to decline in the wet season by− 1.72% in 2025 and− 4.35% in 2085. However, during the dry season, the low flow is projected to decrease slightly in the 2025 period (− 0.49%) but increase significantly in the 2085 period (12.87%) under RCP4. 5. Additionally, the low flow is projected to increase in the near future under RCP8. 5 (1.87%). The results reveal that under RCP4. 5, most Korean river basins are projected to shift from winter low flows to summer low flows. However, under RCP8. 5, except for the Han River basin, which is projected to shift from winter low flows to summer low flows, other basins are expected to retain winter low flows. The findings of this study reveal that more consideration of future low flow conditions is needed, and a robust need exists for the preparation of an adaptation plan to ensure a sustainable water supply to prevent severe water shortages during low flows.",

      "citations": 42,
      "abstract": "Streamflow, the key component of catchment-scale hydrology is acknowledged as being induced by climate change and land-use alterations. The potential quantification of these hydrological drivers on streamflow variations is quite challenging. This study quantitatively assesses the isolated influences of climate change and land-use alterations on the streamflow variations in the Brahmani (36,800 km 2) and Baitarani (12,094 km 2) River catchments of eastern India by applying three complementary techniques involving:(i) m-DMC approach (traditional trend analysis);(ii) m-SCARQ approach (slope change ratio approach); and (iii) SWAT-based hydrological modeling approach. The hydro-meteorological (precipitation, temperature, and streamflow) data variation and its significance are studied at a decadal time-spell followed by the Mann-Kendall test and the linear regression technique. The relative contributions of changing climate (θ ji C) and land-use alterations (θ ji L) are quantified at a decadal time-spell considering the initial time-spells as baseline periods (1979–1988, 1989–1998, and 1999–2008) and the subsequent time-spells as impacted periods (1989–1998, 1999–2008, and 2009–2018). Outcomes of our comparative assessment of the study area indicate that the empirical approaches (m-DMC and m-SCARQ) result in land-use alterations as a dominant contributing factor in streamflow variations. However, the performance of the SWAT-based hydrological approach specifies identical contributions from both the climate and land-use changes. The diversity in results from these three approaches is associated with different sources of errors and uncertainty. Thus, it is necessary to interpret the results of different separation approaches cautiously while addressing the adaptive management of a catchment for sustainable water resources planning in the future.",

      "abstract": "General circulation models (GCMs) are indispensable for climate change adaptive study over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is the potential trigger and amplifier in global climate fluctuations. With the release of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), 24 GCMs from CMIP5 and CMIP6 were comparatively evaluated for precipitation and air temperature simulations based on the China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD). Rank score results showed that CMIP6 models generally performed better than CMIP5 for precipitation and surface air temperature over the TP. According to multimodel ensembles (MMEs) of the optimal GCMs for each climate variable, the overestimation of precipitation was both present in CMIP5 and CMIP6, but the results of CMIP6 MMEs were relatively lower in the mid-west and northern edge of the TP. Furthermore, CMIP6 offered a better performance of precipitation in summer and autumn. For temperature, CMIP6 MMEs were able to reduce the relatively large cold bias that appeared in CMIP5 MMEs in northwest areas to about 1 C and had a smaller bias in spring and winter. Moreover, the investigation into the simulation effects of precipitation at different elevation zones demonstrated that the improved ability of CMIP6 MMEs to reduce bias was mainly concentrated in the elevation zones of 2,000-3,000 m and over 5,000 m, where the precipitation bias was more than 200%. Additionally, CMIP6 MMEs of temperature were able to reduce the bias to less than 2 C in each elevation zone, with the minimum bias of− 0.22 C distributed in the region with altitudes from 3,000 to 4,000 m, while the biases of CMIP5 MMEs  in the region of 4,000-5,000 m and over 5,000 m were smaller than those ofCMIP6 MMEs. Findings obtained in this study could provide a scientific refer-ence for related climate change research over the TP. GCMs of CMIP6 performbetter than those of CMIP5 for precipitation and temperature over theTP. Multimodel ensembles (MMEs) of CMIP6 effectively reduce the over-estimation of precipitation from CMIP5 MMEs by 40 mm at the annual scale.Improved ability of CMIP6 MMEs shows a significant elevation dependency,especially in elevation zones of 2,000-3,000 m and over 5,000 m forprecipitation.",

      "abstract": "The warming climate can considerably affect socioeconomic activities and environmental health conditions in Canada. Climate models play a key role in evaluating the impact of climate change and developing adaption and mitigation strategies corresponding to Canadian regions. This study compares the behavior of climate models participating in the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) with their CMIP5 predecessors in representing a set of climate indices relevant to Canada’s agricultural productivity, infrastructure resilience, and environmental health. Our results show that although CMIP5 and CMIP6 multi‐model ensemble mean values for the considered indices are almost similar, the behavior of individual CMIP5 and CMIP6 models or even the model pairs of the same modeling center can be different across Canada. Moreover, the CMIP6 models do not necessarily outperform CMIP5 in comparison to NOAA and NCEP reanalysis datasets in simulating the annual mean and coefficient of variation values for the indices during the historical period. The comparisons between models’ simulations also reveal that the envelope of estimated values based on individual CMIP6 models does not cover or overlap with their CMIP5 counterparts or even with other CMIP6 models. Therefore, the CMIP6 models with higher number of simulations do not necessarily provide a larger range of projections over Canadian regions. The divergence between CMIP5 and CMIP6 models’ behavior is more obvious under the 8.5 W/m 2 forcing in the long‐term horizon. Overall, the estimated sign, magnitude, and spatial pattern of changes in the climate indices depend on the considered climate model and forcing scenario.",

      "abstract": "With the recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), water experts and flood modellers are curious to explore the efficacy of the new and upgraded climate models in representing flood inundation dynamics and how they will be impacted in the future by climate change. In this study, for the first time, we consider the latest group of General Circulation Models (GCMs) from CMIP6 to examine the probable changes in floodplain regimes over Canada. A set of 17 GCMs from Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 4.5 (medium forcing) and 8.5 (high end forcing) common to historical (1980 to 2019), near-future (2021 to 2060), and far-future (2061 to 2100) time-periods are selected. A comprehensive framework consisting of hydrodynamic flood modelling, and statistical experiments are put forward to derive high-resolution Canada-wide floodplain maps for 100 and 200-yr return periods. The changes in floodplain regimes for the future periods are analyzed over drainage basin scale in terms of (i) changes in flood inundation extents, (ii) changes in flood hazards (high and very-high classes), and (iii) changes in flood frequency. Our results show a significant rise (>30%) in flood inundation extents in the future periods; particularly intense over western and eastern regions. The flood hazards are expected to cover ~16% more geographical area of Canada. We also find that large areas in northern and western Canada and a few spots in the eastern parts of Canada will be getting flooded more frequently compared to the historical period. The observations derived from this study are vital for enhancing flood preparedness, optimal land-use planning, and refurbishing both structural and non-structural flood control options for improved resilience. The study instills new knowledge on revamping the existing flood management approaches and adaptation strategies for future protection.",

      "abstract": "Climate change (CC) will most likely alter the future low flows and adapting to its impact is the key to successful management of water resources. This study investigates CC impact on the full spectrum of low flows by taking the case of Budhigandaki River Basin under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, considering baseline flows (1983–2012) and ensembled future flows (2021–2099). Gumbel distribution is found to be the best fit for 1-day, 7-day, 30-day, and monthly low flow series and the same is used to compare the future 2, 5, 10, 20, 25 and 50-year return period low flows against the corresponding baseline flows for three time windows: Near (2021–2050), Mid (2046–2075) and Far Future (2070–2099). Our results analyzing 72 scenarios show that future low flows are expected to increase compared to the corresponding baseline flows for all return periods, emission scenarios and time windows. It can be attributed to higher anticipated future rainfall in the basin. The respective changes are higher under RCP 8.5 than under RCP 4.5. The change in the projected low flows compared to the baseline for different durations increases with the return period under both RCPs in all the time windows. Contrary to the popular belief, CC is expected to have positive implications on low flows in this region.",

      "abstract": "The present study proposes a multi-stage procedure for selecting general circulation models (GCMs) which forms the basis for regional-scale climate change impact assessment with downscaling. The procedure analyses representation of climatic processes within the GCMs in the first stage, assuming that an improved process representation in the models can ensure better projections of future climate. The poor-performing models are removed after each stage. In the second stage, the ability of the GCMs to simulate the historical regional climatic variables are analysed. The characteristics of historical simulations of the climate models are compared with the observed climatic variables in terms of temporal and spatial similarity. The final stage involves removing interdependent models based on the mutual information (MI) measure estimated between the best performing climate models. The proposed method is validated on the Western Coast of India and the GCMs CESM1-BGC, CMCC_ESM2, FGOALS-G2, FIO_ESM_2_0 and MIROC4h are identified to be the better performing climate models for analysing climate change over the Western Coast of India. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is quantified in terms of reduction of uncertainty in the historic climate simulations and it is represented by the width of the simulation band for the period 1996 to 2005. The selection procedure reduces the width of the simulation band for rainfall from 359 to 118 mm, for maximum temperature from 11.7 to 2.8 °C, and for minimum temperature from 10.1 to 2.7 °C. The predictive ability of the selected climate models is also analysed for the near future period 2021–2030 and the selection procedure reduces the width of the precipitation simulation band from 428 mm for the full set of GCMs to 184 mm for the final selected set. These climate projections need to be downscaled before they can be used in climate change impact assessment, which will further reduce the data uncertainty. The selected models are highly dependent on the methods, indices and data considered for the analysis. The climate models which are not selected will have their own capabilities in other aspects which did not account for in the current study. The criteria for climate model selection needs to be fixed based on the focus of the impact analysis study.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 20,
      "abstract": "On large scales, runoff changes are complex due to the regional differences in basin characteristics and interactions among multiple influencing factors. Accurately and quantitatively decomposing the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes in large basins with significant spatial heterogeneity remains a challenge. In this paper, the fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm was used to identify the regional differences in hydrological processes of the Yangtze River Basin (YZRB) based on multiple factors. Then, regional Budyko equations with synthetic parameters were constructed for runoff decomposition using the hierarchical Bayesian model, considering the spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins. Results showed that 44 subbasins in the YZRB can be clustered into five clusters based on 10 factors including precipitation, temperature, precipitation seasonality, vegetation coverage, saturated hydraulic conductivity, elevation, slope, topographic wetness index, irrigation water consumption, and proportion of built-up area per unit area. From Cluster 1 to 5, P, T, IRR, and B decreased from about 1400 mm, 17 °C, 57.9 mm, and 1.59 % to about 870 mm, 12 °C, 15.6 mm, and 0.40 %, respectively, while ELEV and SLP increased from about 300 m and 3° to about 3500 m and 10°, respectively. Hierarchical Bayesian models can improve the performance of Budyko equations by better-simulating n, compared with linear regression models. Their R2, RB, and RMSE for the whole YZRB were as follows: 0.9104 versus 0.7591, 4.33 % versus 8.21 %, and 0.06 versus 0.11, respectively. Runoff decomposition from 1982 to 2018 showed that precipitation led to more than 34 % change in runoff in Cluster 2, while the influence of potential evapotranspiration on runoff changes was less than 3.00 % in each cluster. Rising temperature caused runoff to decrease by more than 7.90 % in Cluster 1, 3, and 4. In addition, precipitation seasonality, vegetation, and irrigation water consumption had different influences in different clusters. This study improves the ability of the Budyko equation to quantitatively decompose the impacts of multiple factors on regional runoff changes and provides more reasonable suggestions for water resource management.",

      "citations": 15,
      "abstract": "Identifying the dynamics of water retention (WR) is critical for developing adaptive strategies for effective water resources management under climate change. However, our understanding about the responses of WR to climate change is still limited, which hinders risk assessment and warning of WR under future climate trajectories. In this study, we used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to quantify the impact of climate change on WR in the upper Heihe River Basin (UHRB), a typical inner headwater basin, and predicted the future trends and potential degradation risks of WR based on climate scenarios under three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5). Our results showed that the historical (1971–2020) average WR in the UHRB was approximately 91.1 mm, with high WR occurring in the middle and west of the basin and low WR in the north and southeast. Our prediction suggested that the WR may remain stable during the near future (2021–2060) under the RCP2.6 scenario; however, WR may decrease by 23 % and 32 % during this period under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. By the end of this century (2061–2099), the WR may decrease by 10 %, 40 %, and 69 % under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, due to the substantially enhanced evapotranspiration in the warming context, though a slight increase in precipitation may partly offset this negative impact. In brief, this study provides a paradigm for assessing the dynamics and future degradation risk of water retention at watershed scale, and this can be valuable and applicable for other areas.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 31,
      "abstract": "The upper Yangtze River Basin (UYRB) provides almost half of the total runoff volume of the entire Yangtze River and is of great importance for the population living in the upstream and downstream regions. The recent streamflow decline and more frequent hydroclimatic extremes have raised concerns about the water sustainability and water security of the UYRB in a changing climate. Here we examine the hydrological changes in the UYRB during the historical period (1961–2020) and the future period (2021–2070) using a physically-based hydrological model. Based on the simulation results, the future changes in water resources and hydroclimatic extremes in the UYRB were analyzed. The results show that the mean annual runoff volume in the UYRB during the future period will further decrease by 20.4 (SSP1-2.6), 17.7 (SSP2-4.5) and 22.0 (SSP5-8.5) billion m 3 compared with the historical mean value. The agricultural drought severity will increase in all sub-regions, which tends to be more severe than the meteorological droughts, and Wujiang is going to experience the largest increase in drought severity. Averaged across the UYRB, the unprecedented agricultural droughts and pluvials will occur more than once per decade on average in the future, indicating that the most extreme events in the historical period would become the new normal in the future. The design floods with different return periods at all major hydrological stations in the UYRB are projected to increase, and in the future there will be more frequent drought-pluvial seesaws at the major hydrological stations. These findings highlight the importance of adaptive water resources management to tackle the elevated risk of water shortage and more frequent and severe hydroclimatic extremes in the future UYRB.",

      "citations": 6,
      "abstract": "This study investigates the performance of the 23 CMIP6 models in simulating spring precipitation over China and preliminarily explores the reasons for the underestimation of spring precipitation over South China (SC). The results show that the CMIP6 models can generally capture spring precipitation over China but have distinct underestimations in SC. In addition to analysing the results of the multimodel ensemble mean (MME), based on the regional mean spring precipitation differences over SC, we also analyse five models with greater overestimated precipitation amounts composing the high‐value MME (H_MME) and five models with greater underestimated precipitation amounts composing the low‐value MME (L_MME) as comparisons. Moisture budget analysis reveals that the underestimated dynamic component of vertical moisture advection mainly causes the negative biases of spring precipitation over SC. Further analyses indicate that the underestimation of the intensity of the East Asian subtropical jet (EASJ) generally causes weakened secondary meridional circulation to the south of 30°N and moisture convergence over SC in CMIP6 models. Consequently, less moistened air would be lifted to high levels, providing an unfavourable background for the occurrence of spring precipitation and inducing underestimation compared with the observations. The modelling EASJ shows much stronger (weaker) H_MME (L_MME), which generally enhances (weakens) the dynamic component of the secondary circulation over SC, favourable for the increase (decrease) in spring precipitation.",

      "citations": 20,
      "abstract": "Global warming can result in changes in droughts and hot events (or compound droughts and hot events, CDHEs), which can take a heavy toll on the society and environment. Recent studies have made substantial progress in the projection of these events. However, previous projection studies mostly focus on the concurrences of meteorological droughts and hot events but ignore the difference among various CDHEs. Specifically, the concurrence of hot events and different types of droughts (e.g., agricultural droughts and hydrological droughts) has been seldom explored from a hydrological perspective. Based on phase six of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), we evaluate changes in different types of CDHEs, including compound meteorological drought-hot events (CMDHEs), compound agricultural drought-hot events (CADHEs) and compound hydrological drought-hot events (CHDHEs), for different future periods at the global scale. Based on comparisons with data from Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2.0), CMIP6 can reproduce the overall spatial distribution and temporal variation of different CDHEs at the global scale. In addition, the frequency and spatial extent of the three compound events show a marked increase during different future periods relative to the base period 1995–2014. The projected increase in global average frequency of CMDHEs in the long term period is lower than that of CADHEs (increase by 73.74% and 113.95% for CMDHEs and CADHEs, respectively). The uncertainty in the simulation of CADHEs and CHDHEs is relatively larger than CMDHEs in the future periods over most regions. The results of this study highlight the urgent demand for adaptation measures of CDHEs to cope with compound extremes in the future.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 47,
      "abstract": "A warmer atmosphere is able to hold more water which consequently intensifies the hydrological cycle. The projected increase in extreme precipitation has been associated with greater floods; however, most recent studies have argued that the reduced soil moisture could be causing the opposite effect. We aim to understand how the hydrometeorological variables affect flood discharge and what the projections are for South America, a vulnerable continent that has been barely studied regarding flood trends. We used climate data from Eta simulations nested in 4 global climate models (BESM, CanESM2, HadGEM2-ES, MIROC5) as input for the MGB-SA hydrological model to yield flood discharge estimates. Then we were able to project the climate impacts on extreme precipitation, antecedent soil moisture, and flood discharge for large rivers (>1,000 km 2 ) and understand how these variables are related. Our results showed a strong sign that antecedent soil moisture is expected to be reduced in most of the continent except in Southeastern South America (SESA). On the other hand, there are mixed signs for rarer precipitation and a clear spatial pattern for 2-year precipitations (RP2), which is expected to increase on the SESA and west Amazon and decrease on Central South America (CSA). For basins>100,000 km 2 , results indicate a negative change sign for 2-year precipitations, meaning that rainfall events that generate ordinary floods in large South American rivers are expected to decrease in the XXI century due to climate change. The change signs for flood discharge and extreme precipitation are spatially similar but more basins show a decrease for flooding than for rainfall. While only half of the South American basins are expected to present reduced 2-year precipitations, nearly 70 % of the rivers present a negative sign for 2-year floods, which can be attributed to the reduced antecedent soil moisture.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 37,
      "abstract": "Global Climate change and local human activities have profoundly affected the regional hydrological cycle and water resources. It is imperative to explore the potential changes in future water resources and water-related hazards at the regional scale under global warming and local socioeconomic development, while a scientific assessment of future hydrological risks requires reasonable projection of future climate, land use and vegetation changes. In order to improve the traditional statistical downscaling method, this study combines the machine learning and quantile mapping methods to project future climate under four shared socio-economic pathway-representative concentration pathways (SSP-RCP) of the CMIP6. Future land use is projected jointly with the future climate by the CA-Markov model, and the vegetation dynamics are simulated by the Biome-BGC model. Then we employ a physically-based distributed hydrological model to simulate the future hydrological changes in the Upper Chao Phraya basin under the interaction among climate and land use changes and the vegetation dynamics. The results show that under the joint impact of climate and land-use changes, the study area may face increasing water scarcity and more frequent floods and droughts in the future. Water scarcity will reach the worst in the mid-21st century (water resources per capita decrease 34.2% compared to the 2010 s). By the end-21st century, the 100-year historical flood and drought in the study basin will increase by 1.63 times and 0.59 times, respectively, under the SSP126 scenario (the most sustainable pathway), and by 4.55 times and 1.56 times under the SSP370 scenario (the most pessimistic rocky-road pathway). Results demonstrate that climate change is the major cause for more frequent floods and droughts in the future, while afforestation or more sustainable land use management will mitigate the adverse effects of climate change to some extent. This finding is helpful to the local government in managing future water resources, floods, and droughts in the study basin.",

      "journal": "Environmental Research",
      "citations": 14,
      "abstract": "In general, the impact of two different connected extreme events is noticed on the same duration and spatial area. However, the connected extreme events can have footprint over different temporal and spatial scales. Thus, this article analyses the connected extreme events over India using the spatio-temporal compounding technique to understand the impact at different temporal and spatial scales. This approach is applied to analyse the historical and future connected extreme events. In the present study, coincident heat waves and droughts (Event C1), coincident heat waves and extreme precipitation (Event C2) are considered as connected extreme events. The future events are investigated using the suitable global climate models (GCMs) projections under three climate change scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) 2–4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5). The suitable GCMs are identified with the help of compromise programming. Subsequently, the hotspot regions are identified applying the Regional Climate Change Index (RCCI) method. The outcomes from the study suggest that with increasing temporal compounding, the mean duration of extreme events also increases. Highest increase in mean duration is observed for Event C1 over PI (Peninsular India), WCI (West Central India), and some parts of CNI (Central Northeast India) regions. The regions with high magnitude of duration have low magnitude of occurrence. The duration of Event C1 is likely to increase with respect to climate change scenarios and temporal compounding, especially in the PI region and some parts of WCI. However, there is insignificant change in the duration of Event C2. The PI region identified as the most vulnerable region followed by WCI and HR regions. The highest percentage of area under the emerging hotspot category is noticed under SSP5-8.5 climate change scenario.",

      "abstract": "Owing to their potentially amplified impacts, compound dry-hot events (CDHEs) can pose serious risk to human life and ecosystems. However, studies have mainly assessed the risk related to CDHEs from the hazard or exposure perspective, while a system risk assessment incorporating the hazard, exposure and vulnerability at the global scale is lacking. This study assessed the risk from CDHEs based on model simulations from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) models for different future periods, including near term (2021–2040), mid-term (2041–2060) and long term (2081–2100) periods, under two different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios. Using cropland and population as exposure indicators, the risk from CDHEs to human and agricultural systems was investigated by combing the hazard (the frequency or duration of CDHEs) and vulnerability indicators (GDP and irrigation fraction). Results showed a widespread increase in the risk to human and agricultural systems (represented by the populations and cropland) under the two scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) across the globe, particularly in North America, Europe, Africa and Oceania for population and northern South America, large parts of Europe, and southeast China for cropland. The median values of relative changes in risk to human (cropland) systems were 136%, 213% and 207%(102%, 161% and 225%) for the near term, mid-term and long term, respectively. The increase in hazards was shown to primarily contribute to the increased population risk. This study may provide useful insights for future risk management of compound extremes in human and agricultural systems.",

      "abstract": "Compound effects of drought and heat are regarded as one of the greatest hazards in relation to climate change. We study characteristics of dry–hot seasons in Europe in an ensemble of CORDEX regional climate models (RCMs). Evaluation against the E‐OBS gridded data set for 1976–2005 showed that the RCMs were able to reproduce the spatial pattern of the dry–hot season length but the simulated seasons tended to start later and interannual variability of their length was underestimated. Bias was larger (smaller) in the case of maximum (minimum) length over the 30‐year period compared to the median length. Changes in the dry–hot seasons were then analyzed for three time slices (2006–2035, 2036–2065, and 2066–2095) and low and high greenhouse gas concentration pathways. Distinct prolongation (compared to the 1976–2005 simulated climate) was projected for 2036–2065 in the Mediterranean and Western Europe (10–30 days), regardless of the concentration pathway. The dry–hot seasons length was similar in the 2036–2065 and 2066–2095 time slices under the low concentration pathway but major extensions were found under the high concentration scenario over large parts of Europe (20–50 days). The projected spatial patterns of changes in the dry–hot seasons length depend primarily on the driving global climate model. Although the extensions are predominantly driven by increasing temperature, simulated precipitation changes modulate the resulting pattern by amplifying (reducing) the dry–hot seasons length in Southern (Northern) Europe.",

      "abstract": "Climate indices are often used as a climate monitoring tool, allowing us to understand how the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme weather events are changing over time. Here, based on complex statistical analysis we identify highly correlated significant pairs of compound events at the highest spatial resolution, on a monthly temporal scale across Europe. Continental-scale monthly analysis unleashes information on compound events such as high-risk zones, hotspots, monthly shifts of hotspots and trends, risk exposure to land cover and population, and identification of maximum increasing trends. While there are many studies on single or compound climate extremes there are only a few studies that addresses the relationship between pairs of hazards, the incorporation of bioclimatic indices, the determination of a grid best-fit copula approach, and the outlining relevance of this work of compound event risks with exposures. In this respect, here, using 27-bivariate and 10-trivariate copula models, we show that the different hazard pairs have high combined risks of indices related to radiation, temperature, evapotranspiration, bioclimatic-based indices, such as the universal thermal climate index, wind chill index, and heat index, mainly over the northern and eastern European countries. Furthermore, we show that over the last 7 decades, agricultural and coastal areas are highly exposed to the risks of defined hotspots of compound events. In some of the hotspots of compound events-identified by clusters, there is no monthly shifts of hotspots, leading to higher impacts when compounded. Future work needs to integrate the framework and process to identify other compound pairs.",

Previous studies mainly considered combinations of frequent hazards (e.g., extreme hot and dry events or heatwaves and extreme precipitation), potentially leading to an inadequate understanding of CEs hotspots, as the occurrence of CEs varies considerably with the diverse hazard types and their temporal sequence (multivariate compound events (MCEs) and temporally compounding events (TCEs)). Here, using daily meteorological observations from 1961 to 2020, we identify 44 CEs types considering the temporal sequences of various hazards from that period and explore their occurrence patterns in China. The results show that 12 CEs types related to extreme hot or dry events widely and frequently (return period 2). By considering occurrence patterns (return period and magnitude), temporal trends, and correlations between different hazards, we determine that the southern humid regions of China are prone to CEs. These results provide a general reference on the national scale for identifying CEs hotspots where more climate action is needed in the future.",

The Mann–Kendall and Sen's slope estimators reveal that growing degree days with mean air temperature >4 °C (gd4) and heating degree days with mean air temperature <17 °C (hd17) show the largest increase (0.93 °C August) and decrease (1.03 °C July), respectively. The universal thermal climate index (utci), relative humidity (rh), wind chill index (wci), global radiation (bio20), and potential evapotranspiration (pet) are of significant importance due to higher correlation and magnitude of change. Country-specific zoning shows the highest warmer days during August experienced by Bosnia and Herzegovina (southeastern Europe) and lower colder days during January by Belarus (eastern Europe). High wind and high utci were experienced by Liechtenstein (southeastern Europe) region during July. The highest wci was experienced by San Marino (southern Europe) in June and Portugal (southern Europe) in March. Bio20 and rh decline were experienced by Russia (eastern Europe) and Moldova (southeastern Europe) in May and September, respectively.

      "citations": 58,
      "abstract": "Compound flooding in coastal regions, that is, the simultaneous or successive occurrence of high sea levels and high river flows, is expected to increase in a warmer world. To date, however, there is no robust evidence on projected changes in compound flooding for northwestern Europe. We combine projected storm surges and river floods with probabilistic, localized relative sea‐level rise (SLR) scenarios to assess the future compound flood hazard over northwestern coastal Europe in the high (RCP8.5) emission scenario. We use high‐resolution, dynamically downscaled regional climate models (RCM) to drive a storm surge model and a hydrological model, and analyze the joint occurrence of high coastal water levels and associated river peaks in a multivariate copula‐based approach. The RCM‐forced multimodel mean reasonably represents the observed spatial pattern of the dependence strength between annual maxima surge and peak river discharge, although substantial discrepancies exist between observed and simulated dependence strength. All models overestimate the dependence strength, possibly due to limitations in model parameterizations. This bias affects compound flood hazard estimates and requires further investigation. While our results suggest decreasing compound flood hazard over the majority of sites by 2050s (2040–2069) compared to the reference period (1985–2005), an increase in projected compound flood hazard is limited to around 34% of the sites. Further, we show the substantial role of SLR, a driver of compound floods, which has frequently been neglected. Our findings highlight the need to be aware of the limitations of the current generation of Earth system models in simulating coastal compound floods.",

The objectives of this study were to determine the impacts of climate change and sea level rise on streamflow and floodplain inundation in the subtropical Logan-Albert catchment, Australia. An ensemble of 11 high-resolution climate models forced under high (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 - RCP8.5) and intermediate-emission (RCP4.5) scenarios was applied. There was considerable variation from the model ensemble result in projections of major flooding events at 5 and 100-year average recurrence intervals (ARIs). The largest events (100-year ARI) tended towards an increase, whereas the smallest (5-year ARI) tended towards a decrease. Floodplain inundation from a 100-year ARI event increased in all simulations and inclusion of sea level rise resulted in increased floodplain inundation area nearly doubling by the end of the century, which has substantial implications for flood risk. Our study highlights the non-linear nature of climate change impacts on streamflow and floodplain inundation, demonstrating the need for a comprehensive assessment at the floodplain scale when informing preparedness for future flooding events.",

The GEP obtained the formula as a function of the inflow branches based on the fitting data for simulating the outflow hydrograph of the multiple inflows system.

      "abstract": "The design of water resource structures needs long-term runoff data which is always a problem in developing countries due to the involvement of huge cost of operation and maintenance of gauge discharge sites. Hydrological modelling provides a solution to this problem by developing relationship between different hydrological processes. In the past, several models have been propagated to model runoff using simple empirical relationships between rainfall and runoff to complex physical model using spatially distributed information and time series data of climatic variables. In the present study, an attempt has been made to compare two conceptual models including TANK and Australian water balance model (AWBM) and a physically distributed but lumped on HRUs scale SWAT model for Tandula basin of Chhattisgarh (India). The daily data of reservoirs levels, evaporation, seepage and releases were used in a water balance model to compute runoff from the catchment for the period of 24 years from 1991 to 2014. The rainfall runoff library (RRL) tool was used to set up TANK model and AWBM using auto and genetic algorithm, respectively, and SWAT model with SWATCUP application using sequential uncertainty fitting as optimization techniques. Several tests for goodness of fit have been applied to compare the performance of conceptual and semi-distributed physical models. The analysis suggested that TANK model of RRL performed most appropriately among all the models applied in the analysis; however, SWAT model having spatial and climatic data can be used for impact assessment of change due to climate and land use in the basin.",

      "abstract": "Land use change is one of the dominant driving factors of hydrological change at the watershed scale. Thus, understanding the hydrological responses to land use changes can facilitate development of sustainable water resource management. The land use of the Wei River (the largest tributary of the Yellow River) Basin (WRB) has changed greatly due to the large-scale ecological restoration program in the Chinese Loess Plateau (e.g., grain-for-green program), causing dramatic impacts on the water cycle. This study was to simulate the impacts of land use and land cover change (LUCC) on the key hydrological components, using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). We investigated the spatiotemporal changes of LUCC from 1980 to 2010 in terms of four sub-regions (i.e., three subbasins and one mid-downstream area) and three landforms (i.e., mountain, hill, and plain), respectively. Then, we quantified the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological responses to land use change scenarios. Our LUCC analysis showed that cropland declined by about 0.8%, from 58,776 km 2 in 1980 to 57,519 km 2 in 2010, whereas the forest and grassland areas correspondingly increased 552 km 2 and 16 km 2 , respectively. The urban area changed more dramatically in the middle and lower reaches of the Wei River owing to the faster socioeconomic development in this region than the rest areas. In mountain area, the main types of land use were forest and grassland, and the main transformation was from cropland to forest land and grassland. The area of cropland in plain could be over 50%, and it was mainly converted to urban land. The hydrological simulation indicated that LUCC from 1980 to 2010 caused 5.3% of decrease in the water yield and 6.2% increase in soil water content, but there was nearly no change in evapotranspiration (ET). Scenarios about slopping land use conversion (SLC) program showed that the conversion of cropland to grassland or forest (i.e., grain-for-green) resulted in negative effects on soil water content and water yield, with a greater effect by the reforestation. In addition, we found that the change of ET was clear in areas where cropland with slope > 15° was converted to grassland or forest, suggesting slope is also an important factor for hydrological responses to LUCC. This study can provide valuable decision support for land use planning and water resources protection in the WRB.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the influence of land use change and climate change on changes in streamflow in the Bengawan Solo River (BSR, 16 389 km 2 ) basin, Indonesia. We applied the excess water and energy approach to three tributaries of the BSR, namely Pidekso, Madiun and Kening rivers, which represent the up-, mid-, and downstream parts of the BSR, respectively. This study used hydrological data from 1982−2013 and land use data for the years 1994 and 2013. The results show that from 1982 to 2013, the annual streamflow of the Pidekso and Madiun River increased, while in the Kening River it decreased. Based on attribution measures, the increasing streamflow trend in the Pidekso and Madiun rivers is mainly attributed to land use change, while the decreasing streamflow trend in the Kening River is mainly attributed to climate change. These conclusions are supported by statistical analyses and land use change analysis.",

      "abstract": "Accurate spatial and temporal measurement of water budget play a crucial role in achieving the sustainable planning and management of water resources. This paper presents a comprehensive integrated approach to simulate hydrological responses under dynamics of land use land cover (LULC) and climate change scenarios over Upper Narmada Basin, India. In order to select the representative climate models, scoring method was applied at regional scale. Best five performing climate models (MIROC5, CNRM-CM5, MPI-ESM-LR, GFDL-ESM2G and IPSL-CM5A-MR) were coupled with semi-distributed hydrological model to simulate the hydrological responses. Considering the heterogeneity of the large basin, multi-site calibration and parameters sensitivity analysis were performed using Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) algorithm. To compute the hydrological sensitivity against land use change, calibrated model was coupled with historical and futuristic land use scenarios (1990, 2000, 2010 and 2030). The results indicate intensified precipitation towards the late 21st century, whereas annual mean temperature could be raised by 1.79 °C and 3.57 °C under mid and high emission scenarios respectively, at the end of century. Annual and monsoon flow in the basin likely to increase during the 2050 s (2041–2070) and 2080 s (2071–2100). Moreover, the relation between climate variables and water budget components were identified to analyse the hydrological sensitivity of the basin under changing climate.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Management",
      "citations": 33,
      "abstract": "Flash floods can be characterized by several variables. Of these, soil moisture (SM) is an important environmental factor that plays a key role in hydrological and ecological processes and affects the mechanisms that cause flash floods. To more accurately determine the occurrence probability of flash floods, the combined effects of soil moisture and rainfall indexes were considered in this paper, and the copula function approach was explored for use in joint probability analyses of flash flood risks. The results showed that (1) the Clayton copula function offered the best fit for the bivariate joint distribution and captured the occurrence probability of the combination of both peak flow (PF) and SM, while the t-copula function achieved the best fit for the multivariate joint distribution, which presented different combinations of characteristic flash flood parameters. (2) The joint distribution probability of flash floods increased with increasing risk parameter thresholds. Return period analysis indicated that the return periods of the bivariate joint distribution were smaller than those of the multivariate joint distribution. (3) If PF and SM are fixed, the occurrence probability of flash floods is higher in regions where the maximum 1-h rainfall is higher. This study provides an effective and quantitative approach to improving flash flood prediction and advances the application of this approach for the management of future flash flood risks.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Research",
      "citations": 17,
      "abstract": "A vine copula‐based ensemble downscaling (VCED) framework is proposed to jointly downscale the projected precipitation from multiple regional climate models (RCMs). This approach can effectively reduce the biases inherent to precipitation projections from different RCMs and thus provide more reliable ensemble projections. The proposed approach was applied to RCM projections over the Loess Plateau of China, which features complex topography and various climatic zones. Precipitation projections from 7 RCMs were used, and 21 sets of downscaling results were obtained. The performance of the VCED in reproducing historical precipitation across the Loess Plateau was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), the Taylor diagram, and the rank histogram (RH). The proposed VCED approach was found to be more effective than quantile mapping and bivariate copula methods in achieving robust precipitation projections. Overall flat RH diagrams indicate that the ensemble prediction and observations have strong consistency in distribution. Future precipitation changes of two 30‐year periods (i.e., the 2050s and 2080s) under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) over the Loess Plateau were then analyzed after postdownscaling processes. The results show that the average annual precipitation over the Loess Plateau may increase by 8.4%–11.4% under the RCP 4.5 scenario and by 9.3%–17.5% under RCP 8.5. The projected precipitation in the south‐central parts of the Loess Plateau would be significantly reduced whereas those of the other parts be significantly increased.",

      "abstract": "This study employs copula model to discuss joint relationship and design scenarios between precipitation ( P ), surface temperature ( T ), and precipitable water ( PW ) in seven regions and mainland China over 1980–2016 within a bivariate framework. Markov Chain Monte Carlo modeling in a Bayesian framework was applied to calculate copula parameters while best fitted copulas were assessed using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Nash‐Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), and maximum likelihood criteria. Results showed that the spatial variations of P decreased from South to Northwest, T decreased from South to North and from East to West. Distributions of P and T were similar, with higher values in regions c and d . PW was higher in the south, with more than 64.54 mm in the southwest, 25 mm in the north‐central. The correlation between PW and P as well as PW and T were higher than 0.74. Birnbaum Saunders distribution was considered appropriate to fit P in regions a and f while P and PW in other regions are good with Generalized Pareto. T performed better with generalized extreme in all regions. Moreover, Gumbel, Frank, and Joe copulas provided good fit for PW and P in regions b , f , and g , respectively while in regions a , c , d , and e , Nelson provided perfect fit. For PW and T , Nelson was a good fit in all regions. The bivariate probabilities and design scenarios in various regions suggest tremendous variations, with regions having high probabilities associated with low return periods. We showed that joint analysis of climate variables gives more robust design quantiles.",

      "abstract": "The thermal regime of rivers plays a crucial role in chemical, biological and ecological processes. Effectively predicting water temperature is a key issue related to environment management. This study develops a probabilistic model based on C-vine copulas for water temperature prediction. The proposed framework is applied to forecast daily water temperature in the Yangtze River, considering long-term effects of preceding air temperature and daily discharge. The prediction performance of this framework is compared with the logistic regression model (LogR) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN). The results of this study indicate that the proposed C-vine copula framework and GRNN model provide better forecasting of stream temperature with weak human-related disturbances than LogR model. The outperformance of C-vine framework is reflected by its ability to accurately capture variations in the water temperature greatly affected by the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). This steady and reliable framework is further applied for the conservation of Chinese Sturgeon to estimate the range of suggested discharge, given the daily air temperatures, to adjust the water temperature within 18–20 °C at Yichang station during the spawning season. This application is verified to be more effective, providing indications for reservoir management to lower water temperatures by regulating river flow to ensure the occurrence of spawning activities. The results of this study may provide a scientific reference for the ecological operation of reservoirs in regulated rivers.",

      "abstract": "Monitoring and prediction of agricultural drought are paramount to food security at the global and regional scales, particularly under the influence of climate change and anthropogenic activities. Soil moisture is an effective indicator for monitoring and characterizing agricultural drought. Soil moisture (agricultural drought) is mainly affected by precipitation (meteorological drought) and temperature (hot conditions). Owing to the flexibility of vine copulas in handling multidimensional variables by decomposing them into pair copula constructions (PCCs), we propose a novel drought prediction method using three predictors, namely antecedent meteorological drought, previous hot conditions, and persistent agricultural drought, based on the conditional distributions of C‐vine copulas in a four‐dimensional scenario. The proposed model was applied to agricultural drought (characterized by the standardized soil moisture index (SSI)) prediction with 1–2‐months lead time for the summer season (i.e., August at a 6‐months timescale) in China. Taking two severe agricultural drought events that occurred in many regions across China in August of 2006 and 2014 as validation cases, the SSI predictions with 1–2‐months lead time using the conditional C‐vine copulas model were found to be generally consistent with the corresponding historical SSI observations in most parts of China. Performance evaluation using the Nash‐Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), coefficient of determination ( R 2 ), and F 1 score ( F 1 S ) for different climate regions also indicated that this model provided a reliable prediction of agricultural drought for most areas of China. The outcome of this study can serve as a guidance for drought prediction, early warning, and drought mitigation.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 21,
      "abstract": "Probabilistic hydrological forecasting and ensemble techniques have leveraged streamflow prediction at regional to continental scales up to several weeks in advance. However, ensembles that only account for meteorological forecast uncertainty are typically biased and subject to dispersion errors, thus limiting their use for rational decision-making and optimization systems. Statistical postprocessing is therefore necessary to convert ensemble forecasts into calibrated and sharp predictive distributions, and it should also account for dependencies between lead times to enable realistic forecast trajectories. This work provides a continental-scale assessment of the use of statistical postprocessing on medium-range, ensemble streamflow forecasts over South America (SA). These forecasts were produced through a large-scale hydrologic–hydrodynamic model forced with a global precipitation dataset and ECMWF reforecast data. The Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS) technique was used to generate conditional predictive distributions in 488 locations at each forecast lead time, while the Ensemble Copula Coupling method with the transformation scheme (ECC-T) was applied to derive ensemble traces from EMOS distributions. Postprocessed streamflow forecasts were cross-validated for the period from 1996 to 2014 using a range of verification metrics. Results showed that the skill and reliability of EMOS forecasts substantially improve over the raw ensembles, and that EMOS leads to skillful predictions relative to discharge climatology and persistence forecasts up to 15 days in advance in most locations. Furthermore, EMOS results in predictive distributions that are generally sharper than the climatology. Limitations in depicting autocorrelations of forecast trajectories were observed in rivers for which the raw ensemble spread is very low and EMOS has to largely increase dispersion, especially at short lead times. The study’s findings suggest that combining a continental-scale hydrological model with EMOS and ECC-T methods can lead to skillful predictions and realistic ensemble traces in several locations in SA, even if in situ hydrometeorological observations are not available in real time.",

      "abstract": "Stream discharge is a key hydrological factor for water supply planning, wetland loss investigation, ecological service assessment, and climate change impact estimation. Conceptually, stream discharge is expected to be highly and positively related to precipitation. In reality, however, such a relationship may be weaker because precipitation characteristics are affected by local climate of watersheds. For many watersheds around the world, a vast amount of precipitation data are readily available but the stream discharge data are very limited or unavailable. It would be time‐saving and cost‐effective to predict stream discharge based on precipitation data. Unfortunately, this task is very difficult to achieve using the traditional methods. Although the copula method is able to establish a good relationship (or a good dependence structure) between discharges and precipitations, this relationship does not include the time series process, and thus is impractical for applications. Therefore, a hybrid of copula prediciton and time series computation was developed (with detailed procedures) here to estimate stream discharge based on precipitation data. The method was validated using the measured daily discharges with the good statistical measures, that is, the Kandell’s τ (0.42–0.44), normalized root mean square error (2.19–2.28 m 3 /s), and R 2 (0.66–0.84). This study suggests that the hybrid method is a useful tool to predict stream discharges based on precipitation data.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Research",
      "citations": 24,
      "abstract": "Precipitation intensity–duration–frequency (IDF) curves play a crucial role in the design and planning of urban infrastructure to reduce the risk of urban flooding and rainfall‐triggered landslides. However, changing rainfall characteristics in a warming climate render conventional IDF curves inappropriate due to the statistical assumption of stationarity. In this study, we develop vine copula‐based projections of future IDF curves at sub‐daily to multi‐day time scales with a multi‐model ensemble of five regional climate simulations over China. Stochastic spatiotemporal downscaling of precipitation is achieved to generate extreme precipitation simulations at a high spatial (0.1°) and temporal (3 hourly) resolution. These downscaled simulations are combined by the vine copula to improve the reliability and accuracy of climate‐model‐based IDF curves relative to historical observations. Our findings reveal that climate‐model‐based stochastic downscaling of precipitation reproduces the IDF curves well based on historical observations in China. The vine copula multi‐model ensemble approach outperforms Bayesian model averaging by generating more accurate and reliable IDF curves. The urban areas of 196 Chinese cities are projected to experience an increase in extreme precipitation of up to 30% in intensity and nearly two times the frequency of historical events under a high emission scenario (RCP8.5). The current urban infrastructure of more than half of the 196 cities would thus be inadequate to prevent losses caused by rainfall‐triggered hazards if designed solely based on historical precipitation observations. Compared to the climate‐model‐based IDF curves, we find that statistical IDF curves based on a nonstationary time covariate (i.e., extrapolating historical trends) are likely to underestimate the risk of urban infrastructure failures under a warming climate. This work highlights that urban infrastructure design guidelines in China should be upgraded to adapt existing IDF curves to the changing climate.",

      "journal": "Ecological Indicators",
      "citations": 8,
      "abstract": "Understanding the response of runoff to climate drivers is important to ensure rational water allocation and address the risk of drought. Many models that assess the effect of climate factors on the response of runoff volume have been developed and widely used. However, models that assess the response of the probability of runoff occurrence (runoff probability) are lacking. In this study, we developed a model by integrating a conditional probability distribution (CPD) and a copula function model to assess the effect of climate conditions on variation of the probability of runoff occurrence. The developed model was applied to the basin of Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China. The study showed that Frank copula was the copula that had the best-fitted effect to identify the impact of climate factors (except for precipitation and air temperature [AT] in low flow period [LFP]) on the probability of runoff occurrence. The copulas with the best-fitted effect of precipitation and AT is the Gumbel copula and Clayton copula during LFP, respectively. Precipitation, relative humidity (RH), and water vapor pressure (WP) were positive with streamflow variation, while wind speed (WS), potential evapotranspiration (ET 0 ), and sunshine duration (SD) were negative with runoff, but AT had an inverse relation with the streamflow during high flow period (HFP) and LFP. Sensitivity analysis indicated that precipitation has a weaker effect on the likelihood of extreme hydrological events than many other climate factors (such as RH and SD). Moreover, the sensitivity of runoff probability to climatic factors tended to be relatively stable during HFP, which was in contrast to that during LFP. This research highlights the significance of considering change conditions when evaluating runoff response to climate drivers, which is consistent with the objective of achieving more accurate runoff predictions to combat climate change and extreme weather conditions.",

      "abstract": "Heat waves (HWs) have grown in frequency, duration, and intensity in last few decades globally and even the latest climate projections (CMIP6) reveal these to get worsen under enhanced global warming. HWs have adverse impacts over biophysical and human systems, therefore, to analyse the impacts of HWs accurately, it is required to understand the regional trend and variability associated with HWs. We carried out a bivariate copula-based joint exceedance probabilistic analysis of HW characteristics to better assess the vulnerability of Indian regions. The regions with comparatively higher HW frequency, higher intensity, longer duration, and lower joint return period of HW frequency and intensity were selected as vulnerable to HWs. Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujrat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Odisha states of India have been found vulnerable and are projected to get even more vulnerable in the future as per the recent climate projections. To unveil the spatiotemporal variability in HW characteristics, we investigated the relative influence of crucial large-scale climate oscillations (LSCOs) i.e., ENSO, IOD, and AMO on HW by introducing these atmospheric variables as covariates in nonstationary extreme value theory (EVT)-based models. The statistical analysis from generalized extreme value distribution of temperature extreme with LSCOs reveals that ENSO and IOD simultaneously have been influencing the extreme in 21.2%, 25.9% and 23.1% of total region taken into consideration in April, May and June month respectively.",

      "journal": "Earth's Future",
      "citations": 8,
      "abstract": "Global warming increases the atmospheric water‐holding capacity, consequently altering the frequency, and intensity of extreme hydrological events. River floods characterized by large peak flow or prolonged duration can amplify the risk of social disruption and affect ecosystem stability. However, previous studies have mostly focused on univariate flood magnitude characteristics, such as flood peak or volume, and there is still limited understanding of how these joint flood characteristics (i.e., magnitude and duration) might co‐evolve under different warming levels. Here, we develop a systematical bivariate framework to project future flood risk in 11,528 catchments across the globe. By constructing the joint distribution of flood peak and duration with copulas, we examine global flood risk with a bivariate framework under varying levels of global warming (i.e., within a range of 1.5–3.0°C above pre‐industrial levels). The flood projections are produced by driving five calibrated lumped hydrological models (HMs) using the simulations with bias adjustment of five global climate models (GCMs) under three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP126, SSP370, and SSP585). On average, global warming from 1.5 to 3.0°C tends to amplify flood peak and lengthen flood duration across almost all continents, but changes are not unidirectional and vary regionally around the globe. The joint return period (JRP) of the historical (1985–2014) 50‐year flood event is projected to decrease to a median with 36 years under a medium emission pathway at the 1.5°C warming level. Finally, we evaluate the drivers of these JRP changes in the future climate and quantify the uncertainty arising from the different GCMs, SSPs, and HMs. Our findings highlight the importance of limiting greenhouse gas emission to slow down global warming and developing climate adaptation strategies to address future flood hazards.",

The importance of bias correction methods in regional forecasts with multiple Regional Climate Models (RCMs) along with projected uncertainties have been emphasized, and regionalization of parameters in ungauged watersheds have been dealt with. SWAT model was run using observed data and then calibrated using observed streamflow of Akeru watershed, Warangal district, India. The R 2 and NSE values for calibration (0.72 and 0.84, respectively) and validation periods (0.7 and 0.56, respectively) indicated a significant correlation between observed and simulated streamflow. Then the model was run for historical and future scenarios (early, mid, and end of the 21st century) for four RCMs. Variables such as rainfall, surface runoff, water yield, evapotranspiration, and intensity of rainfall showed an increasing trend under future scenarios, while crop yields (corn, cotton and rice) showed a decreasing trend. The models predicted an increase in the extremity of rainfall events, especially in the months of July and August, for the mid and end of the 21st century. The results showed that the production of cotton is under threat in the district in future. The results obtained can be used to plan the mitigation and adaptation strategies for the region.",

      "abstract": "Parameter calibration is an importantly preliminary step before using a crop model to simulate crop growth and final yield. Compared with the traditionally accepted calibration method parameterizing the whole model simultaneously (called as “Global Scheme”), the Sub-Model Component (SMC) Scheme emphasizes on parameterizing different functional modules in a crop model sequentially. However, the SMC Scheme receives less attention, especially at regional scales. Therefore, this study led a performance evaluation of the two calibration schemes through using them to incorporate remote sensing data into a crop model (MCWLA-Rice) independently in Northeast China. We found the SMC Scheme reduced root mean square error (RMSE) on average by 4 days for heading date and 2 days for harvest date. Using the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) to assess the similarity between time series of modelled LAI and remotely-sensed LAI, the SMC Scheme decreased LAI estimation error by 0.04. Finally, the SMC Scheme greatly decreased relative RMSE (RRMSE) for yield by 11%. In addition, temperature and topography could affect the performance of SMC Scheme. Our findings demonstrated that the SMC Scheme calibrated the crop model more effectively and reliably, suggesting its potentially wide application in other regions and crops.",

      "abstract": "In runoff generation process, soil moisture plays an important role as it controls the magnitude of the flood events in response to the rainfall inputs. In this study, we investigated the ability of a new era of satellite soil moisture retrievals to improve the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) daily discharge simulations via soil moisture data assimilation for two small (<500 km 2 ) and hydrologically different catchments located in Central Italy. We ingested 1) the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) Enhanced L3 Radiometer Global Daily 9 km EASE-Grid soil moisture, 2) the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) H113 soil moisture product released within the EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF) which has a nearly daily temporal resolution and sampling of 12.5 km, and 3) a fused ASCAT/Sentinel-1 (S1) satellite soil moisture product named SCATSAR-SWI with temporal and spatial sampling of 1 day and 1 km, respectively into SWAT hydrological model via the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). Different configurations were tested with the aim of exploring the effect of the hydrological regime, the land use conditions, the spatial sampling and the revisit time of the products (which controls the amount of available data to be potentially ingested). Results show a general improvement of SWAT discharge simulations for all products in terms of error and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency index. In particular, we found a relatively good behavior of both the active and the passive products in terms of low flows improvement especially for the catchment characterized by a higher baseflow component. The benefit of the higher spatial resolution of SCATSAR-SWI obtained via S1 over ASCAT was small, likely due to very challenging areas for the S1 retrieval. Eventually, better performances were obtained for the passive product in the more forested catchment. With the aim of exploring the benefit of having more frequent satellite soil moisture observations to be ingested, we tested the performance of the ASCAT product with a reduced temporal sampling obtained by temporally matching ASCAT observations to that of SMAP. The results show a significant reduction of the performance of ASCAT, suggesting that the correction frequency (due to the higher number of observations available) for small catchments is an important aspect for improving flood forecasting as it helps to adjust more frequently the pre-storm soil moisture conditions.",

      "abstract": "The abundance of satellite remotely sensed data in the past few decades has provided a great opportunity to improve hydrological models’ simulations and their forecasting skills. This, however, requires an advanced data integration strategy, which is usually implemented using a data assimilation approach. In this study, a recently proposed assimilation method, the Unsupervised Weak Constrained Ensemble Kalman Filter (UWCEnKF), is extended to calibrate model parameters simultaneously with the state. The derivation of the new method is based on a One-Step-Ahead (OSA) smoothing formulation of the standard joint state-parameter filtering problem, which results in a dual-type filtering scheme separately updating the state and parameters using two interactive Ensemble Kalman Filters (EnKFs). The new calibration and assimilation method comprises three main steps at each assimilation cycle: (1) calibrate the parameters based on the observations, (2) update the system state based on the calibrated parameters and observations, and (3) enforce the water budget constraint. Numerical experiments based on assimilating multiple datasets simultaneously into a hydrological model are carried out to assess the performance of the proposed approach over different basins and over two testing periods: calibration and forecasting. Assimilation results suggest that the new filtering algorithm successfully improves the simulated water components during both the calibration and forecasting periods. These improvements are the result of the effective assimilation-calibration procedure introduced by the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "For operational water management in lowlands and polders (for instance, in the Netherlands), lowland hydrological models are used for flow prediction, often as an input for a real‐time control system to steer water with pumps and weirs to keep water levels within acceptable bounds. Therefore, proper initialization of these models is essential. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been widely used due to its relative simplicity and robustness, while the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) has received little attention in the operational context. Here, we test both UKF and EnKF using a lowland lumped hydrological model. The results of a reforecast experiment in an operational context using an hourly time step show that when using nine ensemble members, both filters can improve the accuracy of the forecast by updating the state of a lumped hydrological model (Wageningen Lowland Runoff Simulator, WALRUS) based on the observed discharge, while UKF has achieved better performance than EnKF. Additionally, we show that an increase in the ensemble members does not necessarily mean a significant increase in performance. WALRUS model with either UKF or EnKF could be considered for hydrological forecasting for supporting water management of polders and lowlands, with UKF being the computationally leaner option.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 59,
      "abstract": "The last twenty years have brought significant advances in hydrology and hydrogeology, especially in the area of data availability and predictive modeling capabilities. Remote sensing, imaging technology and in situ continuous monitoring devices have allowed the collection of large and complex datasets. At the same time, the computational power, efficiency and parallelization capabilities of numerical models have been constantly increasing, making possible simulations at larger scales and finer resolutions. Harnessing these new capabilities can result in better characterization of complex heterogeneous systems through inverse modeling, and better accuracy in predicting the behavior of dynamic systems, through data assimilation. Keeping up with developments in data collection and simulation capabilities, significant research has been conducted on developing computationally efficient inverse modeling and data assimilation algorithms. These new algorithms need to be able to handle expensive linear algebra computations, excessive data storage needs, and large numbers of repeated numerical simulations. The algorithms that have been developed aim to achieve a reasonable trade-off between computational cost and estimation accuracy. Two of the most common techniques used to handle this trade-off are ensemble-based methods and eigenspectrum-based compression of covariances. Both of these approaches can be combined with fast linear algebra techniques, further improving their computational efficiency. This focused review discusses computationally efficient inverse modeling and data assimilation methods developed in the past two decades in the context of their predecessor algorithms, outlining their similarities and differences and the applications they have been used for. By presenting a conceptual map of approaches that have been used to reduce inverse modeling and data assimilation costs, we hope to increase the visibility and understanding of these computational tools, as they are becoming more available to the broader scientific community and a bigger part of data-driven decision making in hydrological and hydrogeological applications.",

      "journal": "Earth System Science Data Discussions",
      "citations": 270,
      "abstract": "Estimating how much water is flowing through rivers at the global scale is challenging due to a lack of observations in space and time. A way forward is to optimally combine the global network of earth system observations with advanced numerical weather prediction (NWP) models to generate consistent spatio-temporal maps of land, ocean, and atmospheric variables of interest, which is known as a reanalysis. While the current generation of NWP models output runoff at each grid cell, they currently do not produce river discharge at catchment scales directly and thus have limited utility in hydrological applications such as flood and drought monitoring and forecasting. This is overcome in the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS; http://www.globalfloods.eu/, last access: 28 June 2020) by coupling surface and sub-surface runoff from the Hydrology Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land (HTESSEL) land surface model used within ECMWF's latest global atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) with the LISFLOOD hydrological and channel routing model. The aim of this paper is to describe and evaluate the GloFAS-ERA5 global river discharge reanalysis dataset launched on 5 November 2019 (version 2.1 release). The river discharge reanalysis is a global gridded dataset with a horizontal resolution of 0.1∘ at a daily time step. An innovative feature is that it is produced in an operational environment so is available to users from 1 January 1979 until near real time (2 to 5 d behind real time). The reanalysis was evaluated against a global network of 1801 daily river discharge observation stations. Results found that the GloFAS-ERA5 reanalysis was skilful against a mean flow benchmark in 86 % of catchments according to the modified Kling–Gupta efficiency skill score, although the strength of skill varied considerably with location. The global median Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.61 with an interquartile range of 0.44 to 0.74. The long-term and operational nature of the GloFAS-ERA5 reanalysis dataset provides a valuable dataset to the user community for applications ranging from monitoring global flood and drought conditions to the identification of hydroclimatic variability and change and as raw input for post-processing and machine learning methods that can add further value. The dataset is openly available from the Copernicus Climate Change Service Climate Data Store: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cems-glofas-historical?tab=overview (last access: 28 June 2020) with the following DOI: https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.a4fdd6b9 (C3S, 2019).",

We review 124 global and free datasets allowing spatial (and temporal) analyses of floods, droughts and their interactions with human societies. Our collection of datasets is available in a descriptive list for download at https://zenodo.org/record/3368882. The purpose of providing an overview of datasets across a wide range of hydrological and socioeconomic variables is to highlight research opportunities across scientific disciplines for the study of the water‐society interplay. Our collection of datasets confirms that the availability of geospatial data capturing hydrological hazards and exposure is far more mature than those capturing vulnerability aspects. We do not only highlight the unprecedented opportunities associated with these global datasets for the study of water‐related disasters in the Anthropocene, but also discuss the challenges associated with their exploitation. These challenges include: (a) time varying datasets advised not to be used in time series analyses; (b) fine spatial resolution datasets advised not to be used in local scale studies; (c), datasets built by a wide variety of data sources prohibiting systematic uncertainty assessments; and (d) datasets built by covariate variables preventing interaction studies.

      "abstract": "Study region Annual and monthly ET values from seven global remote sensing products (ALEXI, CMRSET, ETMonitor, GLEAM V3.3b, MOD16A2, SEBS V3 and SSEBop) were validated for 172 sub-basins in Thailand. Study focus This study describes a generalised validation procedure that uses rainfall (P), streamflow (Q) and storage change data (from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment - TWSC GRACE ) and land use information. For each sub-basin, bulk ET was computed using the water balance framework and compared to estimates by ET products. Inverse water balance computations were applied to infer the storage change estimates from each product (ΔS = P – Q - ET RS ), which were compared to TWSC GRACE to assess their monthly scale performances. New hydrological insights for the region under study All products performed very well on the annual basis (mean NSE > 0.96) and satisfactorily on the monthly scale (mean NSE > 0.65). Land use classifications from the Land Development Department were used to examine the ability of four candidates (CMRSET, MOD16A2, GLEAM V3.3b and ETMonitor) to provide ET estimates with correspondence to physical land use conditions. By also considering product resolutions and data accessibility, MOD16A2 was consensually shown to be the most promising product to be used for water resources management in Thailand. In addition to local applications, the outcomes emanate the potential for utilisation on the global scale which should be further investigated.",

Although root traits capture key dimensions related to plant responses to changing environmental conditions and effects on ecosystem processes, they have rarely been included in large-scale comparative studies and global models. For instance, root traits remain absent from nearly all studies that define the global spectrum of plant form and function. Thus, to overcome conceptual and methodological roadblocks preventing a widespread integration of root trait data into large-scale analyses we created the Global Root Trait (GRooT) Database. GRooT provides ready-to-use data by combining the expertise of root ecologists with data mobilization and curation. Specifically, we (a) determined a set of core root traits relevant to the description of plant form and function based on an assessment by experts, (b) maximized species coverage through data standardization within and among traits, and (c) implemented data quality checks.",

      "abstract": "HydroGFD3 (Hydrological Global Forcing Data) is a data set of bias-adjusted reanalysis data for daily precipitation and minimum, mean, and maximum temperature. It is mainly intended for large-scale hydrological modelling but is also suitable for other impact modelling. The data set has an almost global land area coverage, excluding the Antarctic continent and small islands, at a horizontal resolution of 0.25∘, i.e. about 25 km. It is available for the complete ERA5 reanalysis time period, currently 1979 until 5 d ago. This period will be extended back to 1950 once the back catalogue of ERA5 is available. The historical period is adjusted using global gridded observational data sets, and to acquire real-time data, a collection of several reference data sets is used. Consistency in time is attempted by relying on a background climatology and only making use of anomalies from the different data sets. Precipitation is adjusted for mean bias as well as the number of wet days in a month. The latter is relying on a calibrated statistical method with input only of the monthly precipitation anomaly such that no additional input data about the number of wet days are necessary. The daily mean temperature is adjusted toward the monthly mean of the observations and applied to 1 h time steps of the ERA5 reanalysis. Daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperature are then calculated. The performance of the HydroGFD3 data set is on par with other similar products, although there are significant differences in different parts of the globe, especially where observations are uncertain. Further, HydroGFD3 tends to have higher precipitation extremes, partly due to its higher spatial resolution. In this paper, we present the methodology, evaluation results, and how to access the data set at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3871707 (Berg et al., 2020).",

      "abstract": "Extreme weather disasters (EWDs) can jeopardize domestic food supply and disrupt commodity markets. However, historical impacts on European crop production associated with droughts, heatwaves, floods, and cold waves are not well understood—especially in view of potential adverse trends in the severity of impacts due to climate change. Here, we combine observational agricultural data (FAOSTAT) with an extreme weather disaster database (EM-DAT) between 1961 and 2018 to evaluate European crop production responses to EWD. Using a compositing approach (superposed epoch analysis), we show that historical droughts and heatwaves reduced European cereal yields on average by 9% and 7.3%, respectively, associated with a wide range of responses (inter-quartile range+ 2% to− 23%;+ 2% to− 17%). Non-cereal yields declined by 3.8% and 3.1% during the same set of events. Cold waves led to cereal and non-cereal yield declines by 1.3% and 2.6%, while flood impacts were marginal and not statistically significant. Production losses are largely driven by yield declines, with no significant changes in harvested area. While all four event frequencies significantly increased over time, the severity of heatwave and drought impacts on crop production roughly tripled over the last 50 years, from− 2.2%(1964–1990) to− 7.3%(1991–2015). Drought-related cereal production losses are shown to intensify by more than 3% yr− 1. Both the trend in frequency and severity can possibly be explained by changes in the vulnerability of the exposed system and underlying climate change impacts.",

The great majority of freshwater consumption by human societies is associated with irrigation, which contributes to a major modification of the global water cycle by enhancing evapotranspiration and reducing surface and groundwater runoff. In many regions of the world irrigation contributes to streamflow and groundwater depletion, soil salinization, cooler microclimate conditions, and altered land-atmosphere interactions. Despite the important role played by irrigation in food security, water cycle, soil productivity, and near-surface atmospheric conditions, its global extent remains poorly quantified. To date global maps of irrigated land are often based on estimates from circa year 2000. Here we apply artificial intelligence methods based on machine learning algorithms to satellite remote sensing and monthly climate data to map the spatial extent of irrigated areas between 2001 and 2015. We provide global annual maps of irrigated land at ≈9km resolution for the 2001-2015 and we make this dataset available online.",

      "abstract": "Very large and comprehensive datasets are increasingly used in the field of hydrology. Large-sample studies provide insights into the hydrological cycle that might not be available with small-scale studies. LamaH-CE (LArge-SaMple DAta for Hydrology and Environmental Sciences for Central Europe, LamaH for short; the geographical extension “-CE” is omitted in the text and the dataset) is a new dataset for large-sample studies and comparative hydrology in Central Europe. It covers the entire upper Danube to the state border of Austria-Slovakia, as well as all other Austrian catchments including their foreign upstream areas. LamaH covers an area of about 170 000 km2 in nine countries, ranging from lowland regions characterized by a continental climate to high alpine zones dominated by snow and ice. Consequently, a wide diversity of properties is present in the individual catchments. We represent this variability in 859 gauged catchments with over 60 catchment attributes, covering topography, climatology, hydrology, land cover, vegetation, soil and geological properties. LamaH further contains a collection of runoff time series as well as meteorological time series. These time series are provided with a daily and hourly resolution. All meteorological and the majority of runoff time series cover a span of over 35 years, which enables long-term analyses with a high temporal resolution. The runoff time series are classified by over 20 attributes including information about human impacts and indicators for data quality and completeness. The structure of LamaH is based on the well-known CAMELS (Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies) datasets. In contrast, however, LamaH does not only consider independent basins, covering the full upstream area. Intermediate catchments are covered as well, which allows together with novel attributes the considering of the hydrological network and river topology in applications. We not only describe the basic datasets used and methodology of data preparation but also focus on possible limitations and uncertainties. LamaH contains additionally results of a conceptual hydrological baseline model for checking plausibility of the inputs as well as benchmarking. Potential applications of LamaH are outlined as well, since it is intended to serve as a uniform data basis for further research. LamaH is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4525244 (Klingler et al., 2021).",

Currently, parameter availability limits global-scale hydrologic modelling to very coarse resolution, hindering researchers from resolving fine-scale variability. With the aim of addressing this problem, we present a set of globally consistent soil and vegetation parameters for the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model at 1/16° resolution (approximately 6 km at the equator), with spatial coverage from 60°S to 85°N. Soil parameters derived from interpolated soil profiles and vegetation parameters estimated from space-based MODIS measurements have been compiled into input files for both the Classic and Image drivers of the VIC model, version 5. Geographical subsetting codes are provided, as well. Our dataset provides all necessary land surface parameters to run the VIC model at regional to global scale. We evaluate VICGlobal’s ability to simulate the water balance in the Upper Colorado River basin and 12 smaller basins in the CONUS, and their ability to simulate the radiation budget at six SURFRAD stations in the CONUS.",

      "abstract": "To help store water, facilitate navigation, generate energy, mitigate floods, and support industrial and agricultural production, people have built and continue to build obstructions to natural flow in rivers. However, due to the long and complex history of constructing and removing such obstructions, we lack a globally consistent record of their locations and types. Here, we used a consistent method to visually locate and classify obstructions on 2.1 million km of large rivers (width ≥30 m) globally. We based our mapping on Google Earth Engine’s high resolution images, which for many places have meter‐scale resolution. The resulting Global River Obstruction Database (GROD) consists of 30,549 unique obstructions, covering six different obstruction types: dam, lock, low head dam, channel dam, and two types of partial dams. By classifying a subset of the obstructions multiple times, we are able to show high classification consistency (87% mean balanced accuracy) for the three types of obstructions that fully intersect rivers: dams, low head dams, and locks. The classification of the three types of partial obstructions are somewhat less consistent (61% mean balanced accuracy). Overall, by comparing GROD to similar datasets, we estimate GROD likely captured >90% of the obstructions on large rivers. We anticipate that GROD will be of wide interest to the hydrological modeling, aquatic ecology, geomorphology, and water resource management communities.",

      "citations": 6,
      "abstract": "Seasonal snowpack dynamics shape the biophysical and societal characteristics of many global regions. However, snowpack accumulation and duration have generally declined in recent decades, largely due to anthropogenic climate change. Mechanistic understanding of snowpack spatiotemporal heterogeneity and climate change impacts will benefit from snow data products that are based on physical principles, simulated at high spatial resolution, and cover large geographic domains. Most existing datasets do not meet these requirements, hindering our ability to understand both contemporary and changing snow regimes and to develop adaptation strategies in regions where snowpack patterns and processes are important components of Earth systems. We developed a computationally efficient process-based snow model, SnowClim, that can be run in the cloud. The model was evaluated and calibrated at Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) sites across the western United States (US), achieving a site-median root-mean-squared error for daily snow water equivalent (SWE) of 64 mm, bias in peak SWE of −2.6 mm, and bias in snow duration of −4.5 d when run hourly. Positive biases were found at sites with mean winter temperature above freezing where the estimation of precipitation phase is prone to errors. The model was applied to the western US (a domain covering 3.1 million square kilometers) using newly developed forcing data created by statistically downscaling pre-industrial, historical, and pseudo-global warming climate data from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The resulting product is the SnowClim dataset, a suite of summary climate and snow metrics, including monthly SWE and snow depth, as well as annual maximum SWE and snow cover duration, for the western US at 210 m spatial resolution (Lute et al., 2021). The physical basis, large extent, and high spatial resolution of this dataset enable novel analyses of changing hydroclimate and its implications for natural and human systems.",

      "abstract": "Tree height ( H tree ) and root depth ( D root ) are the two most critical functional traits for plant ecological strategies. However, the global varying patterns of H tree and D root and the ecological significance for tree survival under changed climate conditions are less understood. Here, we compiled H tree , D root , and six root traits related to soil resource absorption for 301 field-grown tree species distributed 776 sites worldwide. The relationships between H tree and D root across different climate conditions and the implications for tree mortality during drought events were investigated. We found H tree and D root were often decoupled in angiosperms and gymnosperms among different climate conditions. Greater H tree was prone to occur in warm and moist climates, while greater D root tended to occur in warm and dry climates with low soil water availability. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that trees have evolved towards smaller H tree but deeper D root from the deep time. Although dense root structures to some extent contributed to sustaining the resource supply–demand balance of large trees with shallow roots (great H tree / D root ), the large trees with greater H tree / D root were more vulnerable to drought-induced mortality. The findings suggest that the linkage of below- and above-ground reaches has a pivotal role in understanding tree mortality during drought events. The insight will allow more accurate vegetation model prediction for tree sorting processes under climate change scenarios.",

      "journal": "Earth System Science Data Discussions",
      "citations": 28,
      "abstract": "Motivated by the lack of long-term global soil moisture products with both high spatial and temporal resolutions, a global 1-km daily spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture product (GLASS SM) was generated from 2000 to 2020 using an ensemble learning model (eXtreme Gradient Boosting—XGBoost). The model was developed by integrating multiple datasets, including albedo, land surface temperature, and leaf area index products from the Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) product suite, as well as the European reanalysis (ERA5-Land) soil moisture product, in situ soil moisture dataset from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN), and auxiliary datasets (Multi-Error-Removed Improved-Terrain DEM and SoilGrids). Given the relatively large scale differences between point-scale in situ measurements and other datasets, the triple collocation (TC) method was adopted to select the representative soil moisture stations and their measurements for creating the training samples. To fully evaluate the model performance, three validation strategies were explored: random, site-independent, and year-independent. Results showed that for the random test samples, the XGBoost model trained with representative stations selected by the TC method achieved the highest accuracy, with an overall correlation coefficient (R) of 0.941 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.038 m 3 m -3 ; whereas for both the site- and year-independent test samples, although the overall model performance was comparatively lower, training the model with representative stations could still considerably improve its overall accuracy. Meanwhile, compared to the model developed without station filtering, the validation accuracies of the model trained with representative stations improved significantly on most station, with the median R and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) of the model for each station increasing from 0.64 to 0.74, and decreasing from 0.055 to 0.052 m 3 m -3 , respectively. Further validation of the GLASS SM product across four independent soil moisture networks revealed its ability to capture the temporal dynamics of measured soil moisture (R = 0.69–0.89; ubRMSE = 0.033–0.048 m 3 m -3 ). Lastly, the inter-comparison between the GLASS SM product and two global microwave soil moisture datasets—the 1-km Soil Moisture Active Passive/Sentinel-1 L2 Radiometer/Radar soil moisture product and the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative combined soil moisture product at 0.25°—indicated that the derived product maintained a more complete spatial coverage, and exhibited high spatiotemporal consistency with those two soil moisture products. The annual average GLASS SM dataset from 2000 to 2020 can be freely downloaded from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7172664 (Zhang et al., 2022a), and the complete product at daily scale is available at http://glass.umd.edu/soil_moisture/.",

      "abstract": "Ground-based datasets of observed snow water equivalent (SWE) are scarce, while gridded SWE estimates from remote-sensing and climate reanalysis are unable to resolve the high spatial variability of snow on the ground. Long-term ground observations of snow depth, in combination with models that can accurately convert snow depth to SWE, can fill this observational gap. Here, we provide a new SWE dataset (NH-SWE) that encompasses 11 071 stations in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7515603 (Fontrodona-Bach et al., 2023). This new dataset provides daily time series of SWE, varying in length between 1 and 73 years, spanning the period 1950-2022, and covering a wide range of snow climates including many mountainous regions. At each station, observed snow depth was converted to SWE using an established snow-depth-to-SWE conversion model, with excellent model performance using regionalised parameters based on climate variables. The accuracy of the model after parameter regionalisation is comparable to that of the calibrated model. The key advantages and strengths of the regionalised model presented here are its transferability across climates and the high performance in modelling daily SWE dynamics in terms of peak SWE, total snowmelt and duration of the melt season, as assessed here against a comparison model. This dataset is particularly useful for studies that require accurate time series of SWE dynamics, timing of snowmelt onset, and snowmelt totals and duration. It can, for example, be used for climate change impact analyses, water resources assessment and management, validation of remote sensing of snow, hydrological modelling, and snow data assimilation into climate models.",

      "journal": "Nature Geoscience",

      "abstract": "A severe agricultural drought swept Central Asia in 2021, causing mass die-offs of crops and livestock. The anthropogenic contribution to declines in soil moisture in this region over recent decades has remained unclear. Here we show from analysis of large ensemble simulations that the aggravation of agricultural droughts over southern Central Asia since 1992 can be attributed to both anthropogenic forcing and internal variability associated with the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). Although the negative-to-positive phase transition of IPO before 1992 offset human-induced soil moisture decline, we find that the positive-to-negative phase transition thereafter has doubled the externally forced rate of drying in the early growing season. Human-induced soil moisture loss will probably be further aggravated in the following century due to warming, albeit with increasing precipitation, and our simulations project that this trend will not be counterbalanced by the IPO phase change. Instead, this internal variability could modulate drying rates in the near term with an amplitude of −2 (+2) standard deviation of the IPO trend projected to amplify (weaken) the externally forced decrease in surface soil moisture by nearly 75% (60%). The findings highlight the need for the interplay between anthropogenic forcing and the natural variability of the IPO to be considered by policymakers in this climate-sensitive region.",

      "journal": "Ecological Informatics",
      "citations": 13,
      "abstract": "The mitigation of uncertainties in the identification of natural systems is a fundamental aspect in the development of hydrological models, and represents a major challenge for the improvement of modelling techniques. In particular, the calibration of hydrological models based on streamflow measurements at the outlet of a catchment is exposed to significant sources of uncertainty, such as the impact of landscape features on runoff generation. Remote sensing-based actual evapotranspiration (AET) data can be incorporated with streamflow to improve model accuracy and reduce the uncertainty in hydrological modelling, resulting in a significant enhancement of the model performance. The selection of the right AET dataset for hydrological modelling is a crucial task, in front of the availability of multi-source datasets that differ in methods, parameters, and spatiotemporal resolution. Despite the existence of a few studies proposing the usage of remote sensing-based AET data, there is a lack of systematic comparisons between different products, in terms of performance for hydrological modelling. This paper aims to compare the efficacy of different remote sensing-based AET products in improving the simulation of hydrological responses, both in single and in multi-variable scenarios. In this investigation, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model was calibrated with observed streamflow data by experimenting with eight different AET datasets. The findings of our study suggest that the incorporation of remote sensing-based AET data in the calibration process of a hydrological model can significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of model predictions. Thus, the proposed approach can contribute to improving the effectiveness of hydrological modelling as a quantitative tool for the management of water resources. Another finding of this study is that the calibration of the model based solely on AET yields reasonable simulation results of the streamflow, which is an advantageous and promising feature for ungauged basins.",

      "abstract": "Mapping in situ eddy covariance measurements of terrestrial land-atmosphere fluxes to the globe is a key method for diagnosing the Earth system from a data-driven perspective. We describe the first global products (called X-BASE) from a newly implemented upscaling framework, FLUXCOM-X, representing an advancement from the previous generation of FLUXCOM products in terms of flexibility and technical capabilities. The X-BASE products are comprised of estimates of CO2 net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and for the first time a novel, fully data-driven global transpiration product (ETT), at high spatial (0.05°) and temporal (hourly) resolution. X-BASE estimates the global NEE at −5.75 ± 0.33 Pg C yr−1 for the period 2001-2020, showing a much higher consistency with independent atmospheric carbon cycle constraints compared to the previous versions of FLUXCOM. The improvement of global NEE was likely only possible thanks to the international effort to increase the precision and consistency of eddy covariance collection and processing pipelines, as well as to the extension of the measurements to more site years resulting in a wider coverage of bioclimatic conditions. However, X-BASE global net ecosystem exchange shows a very low interannual variability, which is common to state-of-the-art data-driven flux products and remains a scientific challenge. With 125 ± 2.1 Pg C yr−1 for the same period, X-BASE GPP is slightly higher than previous FLUXCOM estimates, mostly in temperate and boreal areas. X-BASE evapotranspiration amounts to 74.7×103 ± 0.9×103 km3 globally for the years 2001-2020 but exceeds precipitation in many dry areas, likely indicating overestimation in these regions. On average 57 % of evapotranspiration is estimated to be transpiration, in good agreement with isotope-based approaches, but higher than estimates from many land surface models. Despite considerable improvements to the previous upscaling products, many further opportunities for development exist. Pathways of exploration include methodological choices in the selection and processing of eddy covariance and satellite observations, their ingestion into the framework, and the configuration of machine learning methods. For this, the new FLUXCOM-X framework was specifically designed to have the necessary flexibility to experiment, diagnose, and converge to more accurate global flux estimates.",

      "abstract": "Water temperatures in mountain streams are likely to rise under future climate change, with negative impacts on ecosystems and water quality. However, it is difficult to predict which streams are most vulnerable due to sparse historical records of mountain stream temperatures as well as complex interactions between snowpack, groundwater, streamflow and water temperature. Minimum flow volumes are a potentially useful proxy for stream temperature, since daily streamflow records are much more common. We confirmed that there is a strong inverse relationship between annual low flows and peak water temperature using observed data from unimpaired streams throughout the montane regions of the United States' west coast. We then used linear models to explore the relationships between snowpack, potential evapotranspiration and other climate‐related variables with annual low flow volumes and peak water temperatures. We also incorporated previous years' flow volumes into these models to account for groundwater carryover from year to year. We found that annual peak snowpack water storage is a strong predictor of summer low flows in the more arid watersheds studied. This relationship is mediated by atmospheric water demand and carryover subsurface water storage from previous years, such that multi‐year droughts with high evapotranspiration lead to especially low flow volumes. We conclude that watershed management to help retain snow and increase baseflows may help counteract some of the streamflow temperature rises expected from a warming climate, especially in arid watersheds.",

      "abstract": "Heat wave flash drought or precipitation deficit flash drought has devastating impacts on society and the environment. This study explored the historical changes (1960–2015) of the two categories of flash drought over the Pearl River Basin (PRB) in China, and revealed how they would change in the future (2016–2100), by coupling the variable infiltration capacity mode with the global climate model under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 scenarios. Our results indicate that during 1960–2015, the mid-northern PRB has experienced heat wave flash drought frequently while the western PRB suffered from precipitation deficit flash drought. In future, heat wave flash drought under RCP2.6 and 4.5 would occur mostly in the western and eastern PRB. Specifically, heat wave flash drought would become severe under RCP8.5, especially for the eastern PRB. However, precipitation deficit flash drought would be concentrated in the western PRB. Except for the central regions, PRB generally exhibits a significant upward trend in heat wave flash drought under RCP4.5. Under RCP8.5, distinct increases in both categories of flash drought across almost the whole PRB are expected. For precipitation deficit flash drought, only a few regions show significant upward trends under RCP2.6 and 4.5.",

      "abstract": "Identification of thresholds associated with key climate, catchment and morphological variables for hydrological droughts can further improve our understanding of evolution and propagation of droughts in a complex water resource system. These thresholds are associated with complex interaction between climate and catchment variables and they are often connected through hierarchical as well as non-linear relationships. The advantage of selecting a multi-factor predictor domain can detect multiple thresholds that may not be observed by analyses limited to single predictors. In the present study, we developed a conceptual modeling framework by integrating a hydrological model developed based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and statistical models to quantify the potential influence of climate, catchment, and morphological variables and their thresholds on hydrological drought duration and severity for the watersheds located in Savannah River Basin (SRB). The concept of standardized runoff index (SRI) was used to derive the multiscale hydrological drought time series (i.e., SRI 1, SRI 6, and SRI 12) to investigate short term, medium term, and long term drought events based on their duration and severity. It was observed that the linear models developed based on the climate variables may not be capable for predicting the duration of multiscale hydrological droughts, whereas, the performance of statistical models can be significantly improved by the addition of catchment and morphological variables. In addition, among the morphological variables stream order seems to have a significant control over short, medium and long term drought duration across the study area. In the second phase of our analysis, we employed classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm for quantifying the thresholds associated with climate, catchment, and morphological variables that have potential influence on the hydrological drought. The result indicates that the variables and its associated threshold vary for short, medium, and long term drought. The proposed modeling framework can be extended for ungauged basins to improve the drought management.",

      "abstract": "What the extent of meteorological drought could trigger the corresponding hydrological drought with different levels? This question is an important topic in the field of drought propagation, which however has not been resolved. Therefore, a novel model based on a Bayesian network was proposed to address this issue in this study. In this model, the drought pooling and excluding methods were applied to eliminate minor drought events. A drought matching approach based on drought propagation time was proposed to achieve the one by one matching between different types of drought. Moreover, based on the matched drought events and the copula-based conditional probability model, the drought propagation thresholds of meteorological drought for triggering hydrological drought at various levels were determined. In addition, the interval conditional probability was calculated to further explore the sensitivity of hydrological drought response to different meteorological drought conditions. Furthermore, the propagation ratio was proposed to characterize the differences of drought propagation threshold among various regions. The Wei River Basin was selected as a case study. Results indicated that the results of drought propagation threshold were reliable and accurate. The increase of interval conditional probability showed a typical S-curve, which can intuitively obtain the probability of hydrological drought occurrence at different levels under specific meteorological drought condition, so as to effectively guide drought preparedness and mitigation. The propagation ratio can describe the overall resistance of the basin to meteorological drought, and it mainly depended on the meteorological and underlying surface conditions as well as groundwater supply.",

      "abstract": "Under the background of global warming, the acceleration of water cycle process will aggravate the risk of hydrological drought in the river basin. The Yellow River basin (YRB) is the most severely affected area by drought in China’s major river basins, so it is particularly important to comprehensively evaluate the hydrological drought and explore its relationships with meteorological drought in the YRB. In this study, the Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) was adopted as a hydrological drought index, and the evolution characteristics of hydrological drought were comprehensively evaluated in the YRB from 1961 to 2015. The duration and severity of hydrological drought events were identified based on run theory, and the copula functions with the highest goodness of fit (GOF) were used to investigate the drought return period. Finally, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was adopted as a meteorological drought index, and the relationships between hydrological and meteorological drought were revealed by cross wavelet transform method. The results indicated that: (1) drought showed an increasing trend in the YRB from 1961 to 2015, while the worst drought occurred in 1997; (2) the trend characteristic of drought was different in each subzone; (3) the most severe drought lasted for 32 months, with drought severity of 43.29, and drought return period of 23.26 years; (4) Frank-copula was considered to be the best-fitted copula function in the YRB; and (5) the cross wavelet transform illustrated that there was a positive correlation between hydrological and meteorological drought, and the phase angle relationships indicated that meteorological drought occurred earlier than hydrological drought in the YRB.",

      "abstract": "Droughts are one of the most spatially extensive disasters that are faced by societies. Despite the urgency to define mitigation strategies, little research has been done regarding droughts related to climate change. The challenges are due to the complexity of droughts and to future precipitation uncertainty from Global Climate Models (GCMs). It is well-known that climate change will have more impact on developing countries. This is the case for Ecuador, which also has the additional challenges of lacking meteorological drought studies covering its three main regions: Coast, Highlands, and Amazon, and of having an intricate orography. Thus, this study assesses the spatio-temporal characteristics of present and future droughts in Ecuador under Representative Concentrations Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5. The 10 km dynamically downscaled products (DGCMs) from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) was used. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for droughts was calculated pixel-wise for present time 1981-2005 and for future time 2041-2070. The results showed a slightly decreasing trend for future droughts for the whole country, with a larger reduction for moderate droughts, followed by severe and extreme drought events. In the Coast and Highland regions, the intra-annual analysis showed a reduction of moderate and severe future droughts for RCP 4.5 and for RCP 8.5 throughout the year. Extreme droughts showed small and statistically non-significant decreases. In the Amazon region, moderate droughts showed increases from May to October, and decreases for the rest of the year. Additionally, severe drought increases are expected from May to December, and decreases from January to April. Finally, extreme drought increases are expected from January to April, with larger increases in October and November. Thus, in the Amazon, the rainy period showed a decreasing trend of droughts, following the wetter in wet- and drier in dry paradigm. Climate change causes decision-making process and calls for adaptation strategies being more challenging. In this context, our study has contributed to better mapping the space-time evolution of future drought risk in Ecuador, thus providing valuable information for water management and decision making as Ecuador faces climate change.",

      "abstract": "Traditional univariate drought indices are likely to be insufficient for reflecting the comprehensive information of drought. Thus, it is of great significance to construct a comprehensive drought index for drought monitoring under the consideration of the complexity of meteorological and hydrological conditions in a changing environment. In this study, a new copula-based Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Streamflow Index (SPESI) was proposed, which can synthetically characterize meteorological and hydrological drought. The temporal change, spatial distribution and return period of drought were comprehensively identified in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) from 1961 to 2015. Subsequently, the links between SPESI and teleconnection factors were revealed using cross wavelet transform technology. The results indicated that: (1) based on the combination of meteorological and hydrological drought information, the constructed SPESI could capture the occurrence, duration and termination of drought sensitively and effectively; (2) the seasonal and annual droughts were increasing in the YRB during 1961–2015, with different temporal change characteristics in each subzone; (3) the month and season with the most serious drought was June and summer, with an average SPESI value of −1.23 and −0.89, respectively; (4) Frank-copula was considered to be the best-fitted copula function in the YRB; and (5) the cross wavelet transform illustrated that teleconnection factors had strong influences on the evolution of drought in the YRB, and the impacts of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Arctic Oscillation (AO) and sunspot on the droughts were stronger than those of Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). This study can provide a reliable and effective multivariate index for drought monitoring, which can also be applied in other regions.",

      "abstract": "Climate variation and human activities are two prime drivers influencing the hydrological cycle and the stationarity of hydrologic systems. Hydrological drought is caused by significant negative variation from normal hydrologic conditions, influenced by climate variation and human activities. Traditional methods employed for quantifying the impacts of climate change and human activities are based on the assumption of stationarity, which is no longer valid under the current changing environment. In this study, a heuristic segmentation method was used to identify the change point in streamflow time series by considering its non-linearity, and trend analysis was performed on hydro-meteorological variables before and after the change point. A non-stationary Standardized Runoff Index (SRI NS ) was constructed using Generalized Additive Models in Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS). Finally, the influences of climate change and human activities on hydrological drought were quantified at various time scales. The results reveal change points in the streamflow time series after the 1990s. Significant decreases in precipitation and streamflow were also observed after the change points in all study watersheds, whereas the trend of potential evapotranspiration increased at a higher rate after the change points. The impact of climate change on the seasonal (three-month) time scale was greater in the winter and spring seasons, whereas the impact of human activities was significantly higher in the summer and autumn seasons. The influence of climate change on hydrological drought was dominant at longer (6- and 12-month) time scales, whereas human activities accounted for 25.6% and 20% of the changes in watersheds #1018 and #1019 on the 12-month time scale, respectively.",

      "journal": "Weather and Climate Extremes",
      "citations": 109,
      "abstract": "To meet increasing demand for information on future drought hazard to help Australia build resilience and preparedness under a changing climate, we developed new information on drought projections for Australia and four sub-regions based on the natural resources management (NRM) zones. The information reported here includes: two drought indices (the Standardised Precipitation Index, SPI, and the Standardised Soil Moisture Index, SSMI); four drought metrics (percent time spent in droughts, mean drought duration, mean drought frequency, and mean drought intensity); and two drought categories (drought and extreme drought). The projections are developed from CMIP5 global climate model simulations of rainfall and soil moisture for the historical (1900-2005) and future (2006-2100) climates.The multi-model results project significant increases in all the drought hazard metrics, except frequency, with larger changes in the SSMI compared to SPI. The more severe drought hazard under climate change is apparent over a larger area than previously indicated, particularly in southern and eastern Australia. Although the majority of modelling results indicate more severe drought conditions, the range in the results is large, mainly because of the uncertainty in the global climate model rainfall projections. A projected decrease in rainfall results in a projected increase in drought severity (which is further enhanced by the increase in potential evapotranspiration), and a projected increase in rainfall results in a projected decrease in drought severity (moderated by the increase in potential evapotranspiration). The assessment of the ability of models to reproduce historical observations does not show clusters of models that best simulate all the different drought metrics. Unlike previously assumed, the results show that the models that best reproduce the observed rainfall are not necessarily best in simulating the drought metrics. For this reason, all the models are used here to estimate the multi-model median and range of results. The large uncertainty in the projections can be confusing to end users and present challenges in adapting to climate change. The presentation and communication of projections here will also go some way towards overcoming this challenge.",

      "abstract": "Somalia is one of the most drought prone countries both in Africa and globally. Drought events usually develop gradually unnoticed, causing tremendous effects on both agriculture and environment. This study evaluated the spatio-temporal variations of drought occurrences in Somalia for the period between 1980 and 2015 as quantified by Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The intensities, frequencies and trends of drought occurrences were analyzed using SPEI for the multiple timescales of 1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month. The temporal variations in drought showed decreasing trends in severity and increasing trends in drought duration as the SPEI timescales increases. The major drought event as identified by SPEI 12 occurred during the period between May 2011 and January 2013 lasting for a period of 12 months with an intensity of −0.55. Furthermore, drought count was generally high in the southern parts of Somalia and entire country had suffered droughts ranging from moderately dry to severely dry conditions. An average drought duration of between 2 and 3 months was recorded for most (81%) of the locations. The results of this study could be used to support the water resources management, and to promote the realization of environmental protection and crop production in future.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 39,
      "abstract": "Drought events often exhibit distinct spatio-temporal heterogeneity and coupling properties at different spatio-temporal scales. In previous studies, the spatial and temporal evolution of drought events were considered in a separate manner, and some mild drought events were likely to be missed in the identification process. This paper proposed a new drought structure extraction method for extracting all drought events from long time series data and constructing the 3D drought structure, and analyzed their spatio-temporal distribution patterns and characteristics under the interweaving of spatial and temporal dimensions. The 3D threshold isosurface was plotted to cluster temporally and spatially interconnected grid points, so that a 3D drought structure was formed to represent a drought event and describe the spatio-temporal distribution pattern in long time series and the spatial-temporal variability in the development process. On this basis, the geometric and physical characteristics inside and outside the drought structure were analyzed using seven characteristic indicators, such as drought duration, drought area, drought mass, drought volume, drought density, drought aggregation index, and longitude and latitude coordinates of drought centroid. The meteorological drought events in the Huai River basin for the period 1961-2015 were identified and their spatio-temporal distribution pattern and variation were characterized. Finally, Pearson correlation analysis, M−K trend analysis and wavelet analysis were performed to quantify the evolution of drought events. The results show that (1) the drought structure extraction method can reflect the spatio-temporal evolution characteristics and the development trend of multiple drought events according to the outer contour, the internal color and the migration of the location of the drought structure; (2) the drought area in the Huai River basin shows a decreasing trend, but the severity shows an increasing trend due to the increase in drought duration and intensity, and thus the shape of the drought structure is slender and the spatial distribution of drought events becomes more discrete; and (3) there is a good agreement in the identification between the 3D clustering method and the drought structure extraction method. However, the drought structure extraction method can accurately identify mild drought events that are easily overlooked in the 3D clustering method. The proposed drought structure extraction method has the potential to review the development and evolution trend of drought events and thus it is of practical significance for drought mitigation.",

      "abstract": "Physical agricultural drought indices generally use soil moisture to represent root‐zone water availability ( RZWA ). The uncertainty in root‐zone properties, especially in deep‐rooting regions, may lead to significant uncertainty in the results. This study adopted a conceptual model that requires no specific root‐zone properties to model the RZWA . A RZWA ‐based drought index ( AgDI ) was then developed by standardizing the root‐zone water deficit. A comparison over 20 catchments with different terrain and vegetation demonstrated the effectiveness of AgDI in characterizing agricultural droughts, with the correlations between vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index [ NDVI ] and gross primary productivity [ GPP ]) and AgDI (mean ~0.54) being significantly higher than those between the same vegetation indices and the Palmer Drought Severity Index ( PDSI , ~0.22), Standardized Precipitation‐Evapotranspiration Index ( SPEI , ~0.33), and Standardized Soil moisture Index ( SSI , ~0.37). Compared to the SSI , the AgDI was not equally advantageous everywhere, but it generally showed better performance in deep‐rooting regions.",

      "abstract": "Study region Vietnam. Study focus In recent years Vietnam has experienced historical drought events possibly affected by climate change, but the analysis is challenging due to lack of necessary observations for monitoring drought conditions. The goal of this study is to analyze the characteristics of droughts over a 30-year period, using three spatial-resolution MERRA-2 datasets in Vietnam. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was used as an index for drought based on precipitation and temperature. We also estimated the impacts of drought on agriculture using annual land cover datasets. New hydrological insights for the regions Our results identified significant increasing trends in precipitation in Northern Vietnam and decreasing trends in Southern Vietnam. The increasing trends in temperature occurred mainly in Southern Vietnam. These trends in rainfall and temperature resulted in an increasing trend in drought frequency and severity in Southern Vietnam, especially in the South-Central Region and the Mekong Delta. The comparison between the observed drought records and modeled drought index demonstrated that the simulated drought conditions are better at higher spatial resolution. The area under drought in agricultural lands calculated using dynamic land-cover data sets resulted in a better agreement with observed records. Our findings reveal the feasibility of using a model-based drought index in data-sparse areas for long-term trend drought analysis, and for practical applications of advanced re-analysis products in water resource management.",

      "abstract": "Disentangling the meteorological and human drivers of drought is a critical challenge. A key difficulty is identifying natural conditions against which human impacts can be analysed. Here, a combination of approaches is used: a hydrological model is developed for an upstream unmodified location and is then applied to a downstream site subject to irrigation-related abstractions: i.e. an upstream–downstream/observation–model approach. The relative importance of climate change is also investigated. The study location (the Lindis River, New Zealand) has a continental climate, and the lower river frequently runs dry during summer. Output from the hydrological model indicates that despite the warm and dry summer conditions there is a substantial influence of abstractions on Lindis River low flows – without abstractions, dewatering would likely be rare rather than regular. Increases in precipitation associated with climate change could reduce the occurrence of dewatering, but this eventuality will be strongly influenced by water management strategy.",

      "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment",
      "citations": 35,
      "abstract": "In this research, a new drought monitoring approach with an adaptive index—Vector Projection Analysis (VPA) and Vector Projection Index of Drought (VPID)— was developed that considers multiple drought indicators in various climate zones across the Contiguous United States (CONUS) and East Asia. A major advantage of VPA is that it uses multiple dependent variables (i.e., surface-based drought indices) and multiple independent variables (i.e., satellite-derived drought factors) to capture varied climate and environmental characteristics. Therefore, the VPA-based indices can be adopted for different drought types (i.e., meteorological, agricultural and hydrological droughts) depending on the user's selection of drought factors and indices. In VPA, the weights of each drought factor are generated through correlations ( r ) between each dependent variable and a satellite-derived drought factor that is obtained from the new generation sensor systems, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Global Precipitation Mission (GPM). Three schemes of VPID with different combinations of variables focused on integrated-, short-, and long-term drought (VPID inte , VPID short , and VPID long , respectively) were evaluated over the CONUS and East Asia. All three schemes showed good agreement with surface-based drought indices resulting in averaged r (from 0.42 to 0.68) across both study areas. While VPID short or VPID long were more correlated with short (1–3 months) or long (9–12 months) term surface-based drought indices, VPID inte provided a more generalized (i.e., integrated from 1 to 12 months) index that is suitable for varied drought conditions. The spatial distributions of drought from VPIDs agreed with United States Drought Monitor (USDM) data and Emergency Events Database across East Asia for both extreme drought and normal conditions. In particular, the drought areas of VPID inte corresponded with the USDM results with r = 0.83 and root mean square error = 9.4%. Crop yield trends were also consistent with the VPIDs results in most years for both study areas. The proposed approach, VPA and VPID, can be adopted for any region with different combinations of surface-based drought indices and satellite-derived drought factors.",

      "abstract": "Droughts have caused many damages in many countries and might be aggravated around the world. Therefore, it is urgent to predict and monitor drought accurately. Soil moisture and its corresponding drought index (e.g., soil water deficit index, SWDI) are the key variables to define drought. However, in situ soil moisture observations are inaccessible in many areas. This study applies support vector machine (SVM) by using a new set of inputs to investigate the performance of in situ and remote sensing products (CMORPH-CRT, IMERG V05 and TRMM 3B42V7) for soil moisture and SWDI forecast over the Xiang River Basin. This study also assesses whether the addition of remote sensing soil moisture as input can improve the performance of SWDI prediction. The results are as follows: (1) the new set of inputs is suitable for drought prediction based on SVM; (2) using in situ precipitation as input to SVM shows the best performance for soil moisture prediction, which followed by TRMM 3B42V7, IMERG V05 and CMORPH-CRT; (3) in situ precipitation and IMERG V05 as input are more suitable for indirect SWDI prediction, while CMORPH-CRT and TRMM 3B42V7 are more suitable for direct SWDI prediction; (4) the addition of soil moisture with in situ precipitation or CMORPH-CRT both can improve the performance of direct SWDI prediction; (5) the lead time for drought prediction with SVM over the Xiang River Basin is about 2 weeks.",

      "abstract": "As a large control project in a river basin, mega reservoir has obvious influences on hydrological process, and is also very important to drought risk management. However, how much mega reservoir has improved the drought tolerance of the watershed is still an unsolved question. To end this, we explored the effects of mega reservoir on watershed drought tolerance from the perspective of drought propagation in this study. Firstly, the drought propagation characteristics before and after reservoir construction were calculated to reveal the influences of mega reservoir on propagation process from meteorological to hydrological drought. Then, based on drought propagation characteristics and the Bayesian network, a novel drought propagation threshold model was proposed and calculated the cumulative precipitation deficit thresholds that triggered different levels of hydrological drought before and after the reservoir was built, respectively, and the sensitivity of the response of hydrological drought to meteorological drought was also explored based on the Bayesian network model. Finally, we further comparatively analyzed the effects of environment change and mega reservoir on watershed drought tolerance to verify the reliability of the results. The upper Yellow river basin (UYRB) was selected as a case study. Results indicated that (1) mega reservoir could delay the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought in the UYRB, and this effect was weakening with the increase of the distance from hydrological station to the reservoir; (2) the construction and operation of mega reservoir enhanced the drought tolerance of the UYRB, and the probability of severe hydrological drought in the downstream of the reservoir was significantly reduced; (3) environment change accelerated the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought and had a negative effect on drought tolerance in the UYRB, while mega reservoir could effectively resist the influence of environment change.",

This paper evaluates the climate change effects on hydrological extremes based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) in the North-Western part of Crete (Greece) for the period of 1960–2019. This area is considered to be one of the most important agricultural regions in the Mediterranean, dominated by tree cultivations. The climate trend line for SPI values shows slight decrease, indicating more intense dry periods for the next decades, especially for semi-mountainous areas. A notable result of this analysis is that more frequent dry and wet spells have appeared in the last three decades. In addition, a fuzzy based GIS modeling approach for estimating both droughts and floods prone areas named “SPIsERS” is developed, incorporating the special distribution of long-term time period Standardized Precipitation Index (SPIs), Evapotranspiration, Runoff accumulation and Soil available water capacity. The proposed methodology was validated for several flood and drought affected areas that have been historically recorded in the study area. According to the results 24.67% of the total tree crops parcels in the study region is prone to hydrological extremes (droughts or floods). Finally, for adapting to the inevitable adverse effects of climate change, water-saving and flood protection measures for Mediterranean tree crops areas are proposed.",

The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) for 3-, 6- and 12-month time scales was calculated to determine the behaviour of the meteorological drought for the period 1983–2014. Average drought characteristics were found for three periods: 1983–1993, 1994–2004 and 2005–2014. The SPEI demonstrated similar patterns for the 3- and 6-month time scales in terms of the worst drought years for the first and second periods. The relationship between SPEI and AOI exhibited higher correlation in the 12-month time scale than in the 3- and 6-month time scales for all regions. In particular, the AOI had a more significant impact on SPEI 12-month time scale for Mosul and Duhok regions compared with the other regions.",

      "abstract": "Droughts evolve in space and time simultaneously, but its spatio-temporal propagation remains less explored. As one of the hotspot regions in global soil moisture (SM) drought, the Southeastern Asia supports billions of population and trillions of dollars in gross domestic product. Its high drought risk initiated a deep understanding of drought propagation in multiple dimensions for effective prevention. This study investigated the SM droughts with a merged dataset of remote sensing and land surface modeling over 1979–2016. Our results showed that 369 drought clusters and 145 drought events occurred. Spatially, severe droughts appeared mainly in southwest and northeast of the study region. Temporally, the droughts were more severe in cold season (winter and spring) than warm season (summer and autumn). In last four decades, the SM droughts alleviated in warm season but aggravated in cold season significantly, posing a challenge for drought mitigation, especially for spring crop growth vigorously. Furthermore, the drought clusters shared two predominant routes of westward and southwest. The westward route is for the droughts started in winter in south region, while the southwest route is for the droughts started in summer across the Yangtze River basin from northeast to southwest. At a drought event level, the SM drought propagated synergistically with precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET). Precipitation was generally the primary driver and PET the secondary, particularly for SM droughts lasting in summer and winter in south region. The intensity of PET usually enhanced in spring and summer with temperature increasing and crop growing. The findings in drought propagation provide essential spatiotemporal structure for mechanism exploration and important clues for drought prediction.",

      "citations": 34,
      "abstract": "Droughts are one of the most damaging and complex natural disasters in the world, and they frequently affect agricultural production. Drought monitoring is essential for decision-makers seeking to minimize the socio-economic impacts related to drought events. In this study, we propose a methodology to identify the most suitable drought indices and data sources for monitoring the impact of drought on crops. Mozambique is used as a case study, as it represents a challenging example because of its poor hydroclimatic monitoring network and a lack of disaggregated data for agricultural production. A total of seven standardized drought indicators (SPI, SPEI, SSI, SVCI, STCI, SVHI, and STWS) at different scales (1, 3, 6, and 12 months) were obtained from global databases and evaluated as possible predictors of the annual variability of agricultural yields at the national level. A statistical model of crop yields based on time series was used to measure the explanatory capacity of each index. SPEI and SSI were the most effective at detecting the country's historical drought records regardless of whether nationally averaged values or the percentages of area affected by drought (PAA) were used. However, PAA was found to be a more accurate predictor of variability in crop yields. The variability of most cereals (maize, millet and sorghum) was adequately explained by the PAA of SPEI-3, with that of other crops (cashew nuts, cassava, potatoes, tea, tobacco and vegetables) being explained by the PAA of SSI-12. Specific indicators were proposed for monitoring wheat and sugar cane. These results can directly support managers and decision makers in developing drought contingency plans in Mozambique. To further demonstrate the potential of this methodology, it should be tested in other regions with a greater availability of agricultural data, including spatial disaggregation.",

      "abstract": "Drought is one of the major hazards that could have a significant impact on agriculture. In this study, two drought indices at high spatial resolution: Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) and Soil Moisture Deficit Index (SMDI) were derived by 1 km downscaled Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture (SM), Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) long-term SM and soil attribute products, and used to analyze the drought conditions in Australia in 2015–2019. The SWDI was calculated from SMAP SM estimates and SM at field capacity/wilting point derived from soil attribute data, while the SMDI was calculated by integrating GLDAS and SMAP SM using a temporally incremental based method. We found that in the eastern and western coastal regions, the droughts occurred during spring and summer and were relieved in fall and winter. The temporal change pattern of drought conditions for the northern coastal regions was opposite of the eastern/western coasts. On the other hand, the inland regions always had more severe drought conditions. Additionally, the validation results for the 1 km SMAP SM using International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) in situ data showed reliable accuracy and the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) ranged from 0.02 to 0.09 m 3 /m 3 . Both SWDI and SMDI showed clear seasonal and interannual variability, and the drought conditions worsened in 2017–2019. From the 1 km SWDI/SMDI maps in the Murray-Darling River Basin, terrain and streamflow were found to be two deterministic factors for the drought conditions.",

      "abstract": "The economic stress and damage from natural hazards are escalating at an alarming rate, calling for anticipatory risk management. Yet few studies have projected flood and drought risk, owing to large uncertainties, strong non-linearities, and complex spatial-temporal dynamics. Here, we develop an integrative global risk analysis framework encapsulating future changes in flood and drought hazards as well as associated exposure and vulnerability dimensions. Flood characteristics are quantified by fitting a generalized extreme value distribution (GEV) to the annual flow maxima time series, while drought properties are characterized by the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and the standardized precipitation index (SPI). The drivers of drought and flood risk changes at the global and regional scales are explored, and the wide cascade of uncertainties in the risk assessment is decomposed. We find a substantial increase in both flood and drought risk towards the end of the century over most of the globe, driven by compounding changes in exposure, vulnerability, and hazard. A shift from a fossil-fueled development to a sustainable one decreases the global area facing a risk doubling from 61% to 33% for flood and from 41% to 23% for drought. South America and Africa are identified as hotspot regions where a concomitant, large increase in both flood and drought risk are projected. The hazard quantification method is ubiquitously the dominant uncertainty source for drought risk changes, while the contribution of uncertainty sources for flood risk changes is highly variable in space.",

      "abstract": "Global warming will exacerbate the damages and losses caused by drought and significantly affect human society and economic development. Future drought outlook is of vital importance for policy-making to combat drought risk and water crises over the long term. Here, 3- and 12-month standardized precipitation evapotranspiration indices, which can aid short- and long-term drought monitoring, respectively, are coupled with the SOM- K means two-stage clustering technique to map the future drought conditions in China for the future period (2021–2050) relative to the baseline period (1976–2005). The calculation is based on downscaled outputs of 10 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs). The temperature increases by 0.5–2.0 °C and 1.0–2.5 °C under the selected RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. The results show that the differences between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are projected to increase throughout China. Most parts of China are projected to experience more severe, more frequent and longer duration droughts in the next three decades compared with the baseline period. Global warming is projected to have a serious impact on future droughts in the basins located in the northern part of China. The drought conditions in the northwest region of the “Hu Huanyong Line” in China are projected to be serious and complex in the future, while the opposite is true in the southeastern region. Drought conditions in northern China are more complex under high temperature changes (1.0–2.5 °C) than under low changes (0.5–2.0 °C). The results of this study provide insights on future drought planning and management in China and demonstrate that SOM- K means can be used for the classification of drought conditions.",

      "abstract": "Droughts are slow-moving natural hazards that gradually spread over large areas and capable of extending to continental scales, leading to severe socio-economic damage. A key challenge is developing accurate drought forecast model and understanding a models’ capability to examine different drought characteristics. Traditionally, forecasting techniques have used various time-series approaches and machine learning models. However, the use of deep learning methods have not been tested extensively despite its potential to improve our understanding of drought characteristics. The present study uses a deep learning approach, specifically the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict a commonly used drought measure, the Standard Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI) at two different time scales (SPEI 1, SPEI 3). The model was compared with other common machine learning method, Random Forests, Artificial Neural Networks and applied over the New South Wales (NSW) region of Australia, using hydro-meteorological variables as predictors. The drought index and predictor data were collected from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) dataset spanning from 1901 to 2018. We analysed the LSTM forecasted results in terms of several drought characteristics (drought intensity, drought category, or spatial variation) to better understand how drought forecasting was improved. Evaluation of the drought intensity forecasting capabilities of the model were based on three different statistical metrics, Coefficient of Determination (R 2 ), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The model achieved R 2 value of more than 0.99 for both SPEI 1 and SPEI 3 cases. The variation in drought category forecasted results were studied using a multi-class Receiver Operating Characteristic based Area under Curves (ROC-AUC) approach. The analysis revealed an AUC value of 0.83 and 0.82 for SPEI 1 and SPEI 3 respectively. The spatial variation between observed and forecasted values were analysed for the summer months of 2016–2018. The findings from the study show an improvement relative to machine learning models for a lead time of 1 month in terms of different drought characteristics. The results from this work can be used for drought mitigation purposes and different models need to be tested to further enhance our capabilities.",

      "abstract": "The study explores the potential changes in water year types and hydrological droughts as well as runoff, based on which the former two metrics are calculated in the Central Valley of California, United States, in the 21st century. The latest operative projections from four representative climate models under two greenhouse-gas emission scenarios are employed for this purpose. The study shows that the temporal distribution of annual runoff is expected to change in terms of shifting more volume to the wet season (October-March) from the snowmelt season (April-July). Increases in wet season runoff volume are more noticeable under the higher (versus lower) emission scenario, while decreases in snowmelt season runoff are generally more significant under the lower (versus higher) emission scenario. In comparison, changes in the water year types are more influenced by climate models rather than emission scenarios. When comparing two regions in the Central Valley, the rain-dominated Sacramento River region is projected to experience more wet years and less critical years than the snow-dominated San Joaquin River region due to their hydroclimatic and geographic differences. Hydrological droughts in the snowmelt season and wet season mostly exhibit upward and downward trends, respectively. However, the uncertainty in the direction of the trend on annual and multi-year scales tends to be climate-model dependent. Overall, this study highlights non-stationarity and long-term uncertainty in these study metrics. They need to be considered when developing adaptive water resources management strategies, some of which are discussed in the study.",

      "journal": "Hydrology and Earth System Sciences",
      "citations": 128,
      "abstract": "A decade-long (2010-2020) period with precipitation deficits in central-south Chile (30-41∘ S), the so-called megadrought (MD), has led to streamflow depletions of larger amplitude than expected from precipitation anomalies, indicating an intensification in drought propagation. We analysed the catchment characteristics and runoff mechanisms modulating such intensification by using the CAMELS-CL dataset and simulations from the HBV hydrological model. We compared annual precipitation-runoff (P-R) relationships before and during the MD across 106 basins with varying snow-/rainfall regimes and identified those catchments where drought propagation was intensified. Our results show that catchments' hydrological memory - modulated by snow and groundwater - is a key control of drought propagation. Snow-dominated catchments (30-35∘ S) feature larger groundwater contribution to streamflow than pluvial basins, which we relate to the infiltration of snowmelt over the Western Andean Front. This leads to longer memory in these basins, represented by a significative correlation between autumn streamflow (when snow has already melted) and the precipitation from the preceding year. Hence, under persistent drought conditions, snow-dominated catchments accumulate the effects of precipitation deficits and progressively generate less water, compared with their historical behaviour, notably affecting central Chile, a region with limited water supply and which concentrates most of the country's population and water demands. Finally, we addressed a general question: what is worse - an extreme single-year drought or a persistent moderate drought? In snow-dominated basins, where water provision strongly depends on both the current and previous precipitation seasons, an extreme drought induces larger absolute streamflow deficits; however persistent deficits induce a more intensified propagation of the meteorological drought. Hence, the worst scenario would be an extreme meteorological drought following consecutive years of precipitation below average, as occurred in 2019. In pluvial basins of southern Chile (35-41∘ S), hydrologic memory is still an important factor, but water supply is more strongly dependant on the meteorological conditions of the current year, and therefore an extreme drought would have a higher impact on water supply than a persistent but moderate drought.",

      "abstract": "Drought is a natural extreme climate phenomenon that presents great challenges in forecasting and monitoring for water management purposes. Previous studies have examined the use of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage anomalies to measure the amount of water missing from a drought-affected region, and other studies have attempted statistical approaches to drought recovery forecasting based on joint probabilities of precipitation and soil moisture. The goal of this study is to combine GRACE data and historical precipitation observations to quantify the amount of precipitation required to achieve normal storage conditions in order to estimate a likely drought recovery time. First, linear relationships between terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) and cumulative precipitation anomaly are established across a range of conditions. Then, historical precipitation data are statistically modeled to develop simplistic precipitation forecast skill based on climatology and long-term trend. Two additional precipitation scenarios are simulated to predict the recovery period by using a standard deviation in climatology and long-term trend. Precipitation scenarios are convolved with water deficit estimates (from GRACE) to calculate the best estimate of a drought recovery period. The results show that, in the regions of strong seasonal amplitude (like a monsoon belt), drought continues even with above-normal precipitation until its wet season. The historical GRACE-observed drought recovery period is used to validate the approach. Estimated drought for an example month demonstrated an 80 % recovery period, as observed by the GRACE.",

      "abstract": "Drought events occur more frequently under recent climate change. Generally, meteorological drought is the fuse of hydrological drought; thus, it is important to understand the characteristics of meteorological drought and its propagation to hydrological drought for early warning. Taking the Pearl River Basin (PRB) in China as study area, this study adopted K‐means cluster analysis method to divide the PRB into subregions with similar precipitation characteristics. Then, standardized precipitation index and standardized runoff index were used to analyze the characteristics of meteorological drought and hydrological drought, respectively, and the maximum Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the drought propagation time (DPT) between these two types of drought. Moreover, the link between meteorological drought and hydrological drought was explored based on continuous wavelet transform and cross wavelet transform. The results revealed that: the PRB has experienced severe meteorological and hydrological droughts since early 2000s, and hydrological drought was more serious than meteorological drought in each of the five subregions in the PRB. The DPTs from meteorological drought to hydrological drought were mainly 2–6 months, and the periodic characteristics of meteorological drought were mainly responsible for those of hydrological drought. Precipitation and runoff could greatly affect the DPT, while the impacts of evapotranspiration and shallow soil moisture on the DPT were not significant. Furthermore, El‐Niño Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation are important factors that affect the DPT from meteorological to hydrological drought in the PRB.",

      "abstract": "Drought is a major natural hazard that causes significant economic loss across the world. Drought indexes derived from remote sensing data can provide dynamic information in real time, facilitating drought assessments. The evapotranspiration (ET) deficit index (ETDI) is derived from observations of ET and potential ET. ETDI is an indicator of agricultural drought. In this study, actual ET was modeled using the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator with remote sensing data and ground-station observation data as input. We investigated the efficacy of ETDI to indicate regional agricultural drought in a major region of winter wheat production in Northern China. Spatiotemporal changes in ETDI agreed well with the standardized precipitation index (SPI) on a 5 month scale and with the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI). ETDI also agreed well with the composite index of yield reduction ( CI ), which represents the provincial percentage area of cropland subject to drought stress. CI performed better in agricultural regions where water was supplied by precipitation rather than irrigation. Changes in winter wheat yield due to meteorological events were highly correlated with ETDI, rather than SPI or PDSI, averaged across specific growth stages. Weather conditions had significant impacts in April (jointing and boot stages of winter wheat development) in Hebei province, in May (heading and grain-filling stages) in Shanxi province, and from January through April in other provinces. These results demonstrate that ETDI is a suitable index for indicating regional agricultural drought in order to inform drought mitigation activities.",

      "abstract": "Widespread streamflow droughts can pose substantially greater societal challenges than spatially less extensive events because of the complex realities of trans-regional water management. In a warming climate, drought spatial extent may change along with changes in underlying hydro-meteorological contributors. Here, we assess changes in streamflow drought spatial extent over the period 1981–2018 across the conterminous United States, and how the importance of potential hydro-meteorological contributors has changed over time. We first derive a monthly time series of drought spatial extent and look at trends in streamflow drought spatial extent. We then determine the spatial percentage'overlap'of precipitation droughts, temperature anomalies, snow-water-equivalent deficits, and soil moisture deficits with the area under streamflow drought to look at the changing influence of these contributors on spatial extent. Our results show that (1) the spatial extent of droughts has increased, mainly because of increases in the extent of small droughts;(2) streamflow drought extents overall substantially overlap with soil moisture deficits and the relationship of drought to precipitation and temperature anomalies varies seasonally; and (3) the importance of temperature as a contributor to drought extent has increased over time. We therefore conclude that continued global warming may further increase drought extents, requiring adaptation of regional drought management strategies.",

      "journal": "Journal of Climate",
      "citations": 28,
      "abstract": "Drought projections are accompanied with large uncertainties due to varying estimates of future warming scenarios from different modeling and forcing data. Using the standardized precipitation index (SPI), this study presents a global assessment of uncertainties in drought characteristics (severity S and frequency Df) projections based on the simulations of 28 general circulation models (GCMs) from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). A hierarchical framework incorporating a variance-based global sensitivity analysis was developed to quantify the uncertainties in drought characteristics projections at various spatial (global and regional) and temporal (decadal and 30-yr) scales due to 28 GCMs, three representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP2. 6, RCP4. 5, RCP8. 5), and two bias-correction (BC) methods. The results indicated that the largest uncertainty contribution in the globally projected S and Df is from the GCM uncertainty (> 60%), followed by BC (< 35%) and RCP (< 16%) uncertainty. Spatially, BC reduces the spreads among GCMs particularly in Northern Hemisphere (NH), leading to smaller GCM uncertainty in the NH than the Southern Hemisphere (SH). In contrast, the BC and RCP uncertainties are larger in the NH than the SH, and the BC uncertainty can be larger than GCM uncertainty for some regions (eg, southwest Asia). At the decadal and 30-yr time scales, the contributions for three uncertainty sources show larger variability in S than Df projections, especially in the SH. The GCM and BC uncertainties show overall decreasing trends with time, while the RCP uncertainty is expected to increase over time and even can be larger than BC uncertainty for some regions (eg, northern Asia) by the end of this century.",

      "journal": "Remote Sensing",
      "citations": 33,
      "abstract": "The recent multi-year droughts in California have highlighted the heightened risk of longer and more intense droughts, thus increasing the interest in understanding potential impacts for major economic activities, such as agriculture. This study examines changes in cropping pattern in California’s Central Valley between 2007 and 2016 in response to two consecutive droughts (2007–2009 and 2012–2016), factors driving these changes, and the impact of these changes on groundwater level. Results indicate that Central Valley experienced a shift in cropping pattern from alfalfa, cereals (rice, winter wheat, corn, and oats), and cotton, to nut (almonds, walnuts, and pistachios) and fruit (grapes, oranges, and tomatoes) tree crops. This shift in cropping pattern was likely driven by high crop prices, increasing trend in crop price, and increasing water pumping cost, particularly in the relatively water-stressed southern parts of Central Valley. While the total cropland water use for Central Valley remained the same during 2007–2016 (during both wet and dry years), they vary from county to county. Some counties experienced large reductions in cropland water use, while other counties experienced large increases in cropland water use, indicating the need for county-specific water resource management. The results also indicate that both land management (determining size of fallow land), as well as crop management (choice of crop types), are key factors in water resource management.",

It is found that the meteorological drought risk has been decreasing in northern parts of the CONUS and increasing in the Southwest and Southeast United States (US). In the Southwest US, droughts are associated with severe deficits in soil moisture and streamflow, which can adversely affect ecosystems in the region. Meanwhile, droughts are expected to have severe impacts on water supply and agriculture in the Southeast US due to increasing water demand, limited storage capacity, and predominantly rainfed agriculture in the region. The study shows that the impacts of droughts on natural and human systems are influenced by nonlinearity of the drought propagation process and vary significantly across regions in the CONUS.",

However, the impact of a drought is a function of its duration. This fact needs to be considered in the evaluation of a drought. In this study, we use a hydrological model to analyze the 2018 European drought, an event that significantly affected vegetation. We show that the severity of the soil moisture drought is high in Central Europe and Mediterranean, but it does not reach the levels observed in the first half of the 20th century. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that when the multi-year 2014–2018 period is considered, its soil moisture drought severity is exceptional in a 253 year period, especially for Central Europe. While single-year droughts can be sustained by ecosystems like forests, the repeated stress exposure of such multi-year droughts may have significant impacts on their functioning. This is already evident in some regions of Central Europe, eg in the Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland.",

      "citations": 119,
      "abstract": "The co-occurrence of warm spells and droughts can lead to detrimental socio-economic and ecological impacts, largely surpassing the impacts of either warm spells or droughts alone. We quantify changes in the number of compound warm spells and droughts from 1979 to 2018 in the Mediterranean Basin using the ERA5 data set. We analyse two types of compound events: 1) warm season compound events, which are extreme in absolute terms in the warm season from May to October and 2) year-round deseasonalised compound events, which are extreme in relative terms respective to the time of the year. The number of compound events increases significantly and especially warm spells are increasing strongly - with an annual growth rates of 3.9 (3.5) % for warm season (deseasonalised) compound events and 4.6 (4.4) % for warm spells -, whereas for droughts the change is more ambiguous depending on the applied definition. Therefore, the rise in the number of compound events is primarily driven by temperature changes and not the lack of precipitation. The months July and August show the highest increases in warm season compound events, whereas the highest increases of deseasonalised compound events occur in spring and early summer. This increase in deseasonalised compound events can potentially have a significant impact on the functioning of Mediterranean ecosystems as this is the peak phase of ecosystem productivity and a vital phenophase.",

The persistent and intensifying hydrological drought causing the scarcity of water and depleted supplies for irrigation has been effective in reducing agricultural production and increasing migration in the Sistan region. For drought management, knowledge of factors affecting the development of hydrological droughts is essential. Due to the significant rise of drought in the Sistan region in recent decades, we quantified the drought characteristics throughout the basin to reveal the temporal and spatial pattern of drought in the Sistan Plain. The meteorological and hydrological droughts were reanalyzed based on the precipitation and streamflow records using the multi-month timescales during 1970-2006, a period of 37 years. To reproduce the river discharge to evaluate the hydrological drought, the distributed process-based hydrological model was first developed. The results indicate that the hydrological model performed quite well in both calibration and validation periods in the entire basin. The drought analysis represented that the trend of hydrological droughts in the Sistan Plain considerably changed in the last decade of the study period due to the increasing abstractions from the Helmand River associated with the rising evaporation, which have led to extending the severe drought of long duration in the Sistan area.",

      "abstract": "Agricultural drought has become a serious threat to the world food security and sustainable development. Although various characteristics have been investigated for agricultural drought assessment and early warning, the propagation of meteorological drought to agricultural drought is less than clear. This study investigated the spatiotemporal variations of characteristics of the propagation from meteorological drought to agricultural drought over China during the period of 1953–2012. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Soil moisture Index (SSI) were used to characterize meteorological drought and agricultural drought, respectively. The SSI-1 and SPI-m (1–12) were chosen as drought propagation series by correlation analysis to evaluate the correlation and propagation time between these two droughts. The probability of propagation in different regions of China was quantified using copula-based models. Results indicated that the strongest and the weakest correlations between meteorological drought and agricultural drought were found in summer (0.8–0.9) and in winter (0.5–0.8), respectively, while the propagation time increased from 1 to 2 months in summer to 2–7 months in the next spring. Spatially, correlation and propagation sensitivity between meteorological drought and agricultural drought were greater in humid areas than in other climatic zones. Further, the probability of agricultural drought occurrence was found to synchronously increase with the severity of meteorological drought. This study will help improve drought warning and forecasting systems.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 58,
      "abstract": "Hydrological drought evolution (development and recovery) is directly related to the amount of precipitation transformed into effective streamflow. However, how hydrological drought alters the precipitation-streamflow relationship, and how the precipitation-streamflow relationship affects the hydrological drought development and recovery require more in-depth research. We present a detailed assessment of the effects of hydrological drought propagation on the precipitation-streamflow relationship. We propose the concept of effective streamflow-precipitation ratio (ESPR), which is defined as the amount of precipitation in the current month that is converted to effective streamflow relative to that of the previous month, for hydrological drought propagation assessment. Long-term unregulated streamflow and precipitation data from six hydrometric stations in different countries (China, USA, and Australia) were used to investigate the proposed concept. The results show that hydrological drought causes a significant decrease in the precipitation-streamflow correlation and coefficient of determination. However, the changes in the precipitation-streamflow relationship are substantially different during the hydrological drought development and recovery stages. In our study areas, the precipitation-streamflow relationship was weakened by 60%, mainly during the hydrological drought development rather than recovery. The ESPR values during the hydrological drought development are substantially lower than those of the recovery period, suggesting insufficient precipitation leads to little to no streamflow especially during the drought development period. Additionally, the larger the ESPR during hydrological drought evolution, the faster the hydrological drought recovery will occur and vice versa. This study provides insights into the drivers of hydrological drought evolution by connecting with the changes in precipitation-streamflow relationship.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 42,
      "abstract": "Groundwater drought is a drought phenomenon caused by the decrease in groundwater level or groundwater storage under natural and anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., climate variability/change and groundwater abstraction). Due to the complexity of groundwater flow systems and the difficulty in obtaining direct observational data related to groundwater resources, it remains challenging to characterize groundwater drought quantitatively. To this end, standardized groundwater level index (SGI), which was modified from the standardized precipitation index (SPI), was used to quantify groundwater drought with the long-term groundwater level data (1981–2010) obtained from the Climate Response Network wells across the conterminous United States. The best fitting function of groundwater level distributions was lognormal which was selected from various distribution functions based on the Anderson-Darling (AD) test among 100 wells. Four monitoring wells located in Georgia, Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Washington were selected as the main research objects. The trend of change in groundwater level was divided into two categories: the wells in Georgia and Oklahoma showed an initial decrease followed by an increase while the wells in Massachusetts and Washington showed a continuous decline. Groundwater drought varied significantly in different areas due to the complexity of geographical location, agricultural irrigation, population and other natural environment and human activities. Start and end time of drought conditions and the severity of drought and flooding at different time scales in the same area also varied, therefore it is necessary to describe different groundwater droughts at a reasonable time scale. In this paper, the difference between SGI and SPI at different time scales was so obvious that the cross-correlation analysis was used to find the law of lag time. The cross-correlation coefficients increased with the increasing time scales, and the average correlation values between SPI and SGI of wells in Georgia, Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Washington were −0.568, −0.634, −0.667 and 0.496, respectively. With the time scale increased, the lag time in Georgia and Oklahoma also increased, but the lag time in Massachusetts and Washington region was almost unchanged, and there was almost no lag time in Massachusetts region. Through the study of the hydrogeological conditions such as vadose zone, lithology, soil and the influence of human activities, the hysteresis effect can be analysed, which can provide a new alternative to the conventional method and important information for future groundwater resource management.",

This study compares future occurrence of excessively dry and wet periods based on P, T, stream flow, soil moisture, and extreme P and T events. The comparisons are based on coupled future climate projections from multiple Earth system models downscaled using site-specific weather data and hydrologic model outputs for the Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed, Missouri, USA. The use of multiple drought indices, downscaled climate data, and process model output facilitated drought prediction for different land surface processes and its comparison. The P and T extremes and droughts were calculated using standardized indices. The results based on drought and extreme indices indicate increased frequency and duration of drought in the future, primarily due to a projected decline in summer precipitation resulting in summer droughts. The streamflow and soil water-based drought indices indicated increased spring drought risks in the future despite a precipitation increase, indicating the importance of process representation with hydrologic models for drought computation.",

      "journal": "Journal of Environmental Management",
      "citations": 47,
      "abstract": "Since the late 1970s, the Yellow River Basin (YRB) has experienced accelerated land-use/land cover changes (LULCC) and consumptive water use (CWU) that have imposed low-flow regimes. Upon the continuation of these anthropogenic activities in the future, significant hydrological alteration is expected. This study takes a hydrological perspective on drought to project changes in the YRB drought risk under future LULCC and CWU business-as-usual (BAU) scenarios. A combination of seasonal trend forecasting, drought indices, land-use and hydrological modeling techniques was used. Future LULCC is assessed based on two BAU scenarios to explore the patterns of LULCC with (LULCC-BAU1) and without (LULCC-BAU2) the continuation of the Chinese Grain for Green Program. The results indicated that LULCC-BAU2 will increase the risk of mild and moderate droughts, while CWU and LULCC-BAU1 will impose higher risk of severe and extreme events. LULCC-BAU1 is projected to exacerbate the duration and intensity of the agricultural/hydrological droughts. The frequency of hydrological drought under LULCC-BAU1 and CWU scenarios is projected to increase by 43% and 53% during 2021–2050. The future agricultural droughts will likely be more intense and prolonged than meteorological droughts. Hydrological droughts, however, will be characterized by prolonged but less intense drought comparing to the metrological droughts. The meteorological to agricultural drought propagation will likely be driven by LULCC under BAU1, while the meteorological to hydrological drought propagation is controlled by CWU changes.",

These hydroclimatic changes will likely have significant socioecological impacts, especially across water‐limited regions. Here we present an analysis of daily meteorological observations from 1976 to 2019 at 337 long‐term weather stations distributed across the western United States (US). In addition to widespread warming (0.2 °C ± 0.01°C/decade, daily maximum temperature), we observed trends of reduced annual precipitation (−2.3 ± 1.5 mm/decade) across most of the region, with increasing interannual variability of precipitation. Critically, daily observations showed that extreme‐duration drought became more common, with increases in both the mean and longest dry interval between precipitation events (0.6 ± 0.2, 2.4 ± 0.3 days/decade) and greater interannual variability in these dry intervals. These findings indicate that, against a backdrop of warming and drying, large regions of the western US are experiencing intensification of precipitation variability, with likely detrimental consequences for essential ecosystem services.",

      "abstract": "Recurring drought in the Lower Mekong countries has inflicted enormous pressure on the natural ecosystem, rice productivity, and water resources. A regional scale assessment over Cambodia was carried out to examine the linkages between rice productivity and meteorological/hydrologic drought variability from 2000 to 2016. We implemented a comprehensive drought and crop yield information system, the Regional Hydrologic Extremes Assessment System (RHEAS) framework, that couples a hydrologic model with a crop growth model to capture the subtle, intrinsic nature of drought, and assess the impact on inter-seasonal and intra-annual rice yields. Simulations based on RHEAS show good agreement with observations (R 2 ~ 0.65 for soil moisture from the hydrologic model; R 2 ~ 0.84 for crop model). Using a suite of standardized drought indices, the onset and prevalence of dry and wet periods throughout the study period were examined at multiple temporal scales. The temporal variability in drought intensity exhibited higher water stress during the initial months (Mar-May), indicating prevalence of medium to severe dry conditions prior to the planting season. However, the onset of monsoon at the beginning of the growing season (June) resulted in the prevalence of normal to moderate wet conditions. A linear trend analysis for the period 2000–2016 showed a consistent increase (~2900 kg/ha in 2000 to ~ 3550 kg/ha in 2016) in rice yields, although drought-stricken provinces showed lower yields (~1650 kg/ha) throughout the study period. Overall, a continuous increase in annual rice yields irrespective of the stress conditions was noted with no clear pattern linking drought parameters with crop yields on a regional scale. The application of chemical-based fertilizers has steadily increased over the years since 2008 and the consistent increase in observed rice yields correlated with increased fertilizer use (R 2 ~ 0.84). Information from the hydrologic and crop model components within RHEAS enables development of critical regional and local thresholds, reflecting the increasing levels of risk and vulnerability towards drought.",

      "abstract": "The agricultural water resource carrying capacity (AWRCC) is affected by climate change now as never before. However, it is still unclear how the AWRCC in high latitudes responses to climate change. In this study, spatiotemporal changes in climatic factors and AWRCC during the crop growing season from 1961 to 2014 in the Nenjiang River Basin (NRB), a high-latitude basin in China, were identified via multivariate statistical analysis. Meanwhile, the impact of climatic factors on AWRCC was analyzed by using cross-wavelet approaches and Pearson correlational analysis. The results showed that temperature has followed an increasing trend, especially the lowest temperature during crop growing season, with a trend of 0.57°C/10a in the local region. There was no obvious change trend for precipitation, but the interannual change was large. The drought index increased first and then decreased, which was consistent with the trend of the ET 0 . Different spatial distributions of water resource carrying for all crops in a region were shown with a variation range of 0.22–0.76 kg/m 2 in the NRB. It is worth noting that AWRCC showed an increasing trend, especially in the past decade. Precipitation, ET 0 , and meteorological drought were all key driving factors affecting AWRCC. The correlation was significant between the crop planting proportion and AWRCC under climate change. Moreover, adjusting the planting proportion of wheat, soybean and rice, and increasing that of maize, would be conducive to improving the AWRCC and facilitating the synergistic development of agriculture and wetlands in NRB.",

      "abstract": "Soil moisture (SM) plays a fundamental role in governing the water and energy balance at land-atmosphere interfaces and in controlling plant growth and biological interactions, which makes it a key indicator in drought identification. We compared and evaluated two types of surface SM datasets (Global Land Data Assimilation System-Noah-simulated (GLDAS-Noah); Europe Space Agency’s Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI)) for drought analysis in China over 1979–2014. The cumulative density function (CDF) matching method was employed to fill the data gap of ESA CCI data using the GLDAS-Noah SM products. Drought characteristics of duration, severity, and frequency were appraised on a grid basis using the Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSI). The results show that the SSI values calculated based on these two SM products are significantly correlated ( p < 0.05) over most parts (70%) of China, with similar patterns of average drought duration, severity, and frequency. The duration and severity at the arid and semiarid regions (with duration over 3 months; with an average severity of −3.1) are generally higher than those over humid regions (with the duration of 2 months; with an average severity of −2.7), but both SM datasets show higher drying trends in humid regions. However, the two SM datasets exhibit large discrepancies in the spatial patterns of drought duration, severity, and frequency trends, especially in arid and cold regions. Both SM products are capable of monitoring extreme drought events reported in southwestern, southern, and northern China compared with the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). Overall, both data sources have the potential to be used for drought monitoring; however, caution should be paid in high altitude and latitude regions where a large discrepancy exists.",

      "journal": "Hydrology and Earth System Sciences",
      "citations": 30,
      "abstract": "The drought of 2018 in central and northern Europe showed once more the large impact that this natural hazard can have on the environment and society. Such droughts are often seen as slowly developing phenomena. However, root zone soil moisture deficits can rapidly develop during periods lacking precipitation and meteorological conditions that favor high evapotranspiration rates. These periods of soil moisture stress can persist for as long as the meteorological drought conditions last, thereby negatively affecting vegetation and crop health. In this study, we aim to characterize past soil moisture stress events over the croplands of southwestern Germany and, furthermore, to relate the characteristics of these past events to different soil and climate properties. We first simulated daily soil moisture over the period 1989–2018 on a 1 km resolution grid, using the physically based hydrological model TRAIN. We then derived various soil moisture stress characteristics, including probability, development time, and persistence, from the simulated time series of all agricultural grid cells ( ). Logistic regression and correlation were then applied to relate the derived characteristics to the plant-available storage capacity of the root zone and to the climatological setting. Finally, sensitivity analyses were carried out to investigate how results changed when using a different parameterization of the root zone, i.e., soil based or fixed, or when assessing soil moisture drought (anomaly) instead of stress. Results reveal that the majority of agricultural grid cells across the study region reached soil moisture stress during prominent drought years. The development time of these soil moisture stress events varied substantially, from as little as 10 d to over 4 months. The persistence of soil moisture stress varied as well and was especially high for the drought of 2018. A strong control on the probability and development time of soil moisture stress was found to be the storage capacity of the root zone, whereas the persistence was not strongly linearly related to any of the considered controls. On the other hand, the sensitivity analyses revealed the increased control of climate on soil moisture stress characteristics when using a fixed instead of a soil-based root zone storage. Thus, the strength of different controls depends on the assumptions made during modeling. Nonetheless, the storage capacity of the root zone, whether it is a characteristic of the soil or a difference between a shallow or deep rooting crop, remains an important control on soil moisture stress characteristics. This is different for SM drought characteristics, which have little or contrasting relation with the storage capacity of the root zone. Overall, the results give insight to the large spatial and temporal variability in soil moisture stress characteristics and suggest the importance of considering differences in root zone soil storage for agricultural drought assessments.",

      "journal": "Environmental Research Letters",
      "citations": 42,
      "abstract": "Seasonal drought occurrences are found to increase across different regions over China under global warming, but with large uncertainties among models. With ten selected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models and seven CMIP6 models according to their performances in reproducing historical drought trends (p< 0.1), here we show that future seasonal soil moisture (SM) droughts over China projected by CMIP6 models are less frequent than that by CMIP5 models. We find national mean seasonal drought frequency is projected to increase by 28±4% based on CMIP5 models at 1.5 C global warming level, but only increase by 18±6% based on CMIP6 models and 12±4% based on land surface model ensemble simulations driven by downscaled CMIP5 models. Compared with CMIP6, CMIP5 projection suggests larger increase in precipitation but also larger increase in evapotranspiration, leading to more frequent seasonal SM droughts. Comparing the results at 3 C global warming level with those at 1.5 C, drought frequency over China will increase further by 10±4%, but drought duration will decrease by 6±4%, suggesting more frequent seasonal SM droughts with shorter durations will occur in a warming future. The future increase in China drought frequency will reduce from 12%–45% based on selected climate models to 3%–27% based on all available models (30 CMIP5 models and 31 CMIP6 models), which indicates that the model selection is critical for future drought projection. Nevertheless, CMIP6 still projects less frequent seasonal SM droughts than CMIP5 even without any model discriminations.",

      "abstract": "We examine the drought variability over the conterminous United States (CONUS) for 1915–2018 using the Noah-MP land surface model. We examine different model options on drought reconstruction, including optional representation of groundwater and dynamic vegetation phenology. Over our 104-yr reconstruction period, we identify 12 great droughts that each covered at least 36% of CONUS and lasted for at least 5 months. The great droughts tend to have smaller areas when groundwater and/or dynamic vegetation are included in the model configuration. We detect a small decreasing trend in dry area coverage over CONUS in all configurations. We identify 45 major droughts in the baseline (with a dry area coverage greater than 23.6% of CONUS) that are, on average, somewhat less severe than great droughts. We find that representation of groundwater tends to increase drought duration for both great and major droughts, primarily by leading to earlier drought onset (some due to short-lived recovery from a previous drought) or later demise (groundwater anomalies lag precipitation anomalies). In contrast, representation of dynamic vegetation tends to shorten major droughts duration, primarily due to earlier drought demise (closed stoma or dead vegetation reduces ET loss during droughts). On a regional basis, the U.S. Southwest (Southeast) has the longest (shortest) major drought durations. Consistent with earlier work, dry area coverage in all subregions except the Southwest has decreased. The effects of groundwater and dynamic vegetation vary regionally due to differences in groundwater depths (hence connectivity with the surface) and vegetation types.",

      "abstract": "Yunnan Province in southwest China is characterized by a vast area, diverse climate types, rich ecosystem types, and unique biodiversity resources. With consideration of global climate change, there is an urgent need to evaluate the response of vegetation to drought in Yunnan. This study utilized the MOD13A3, MOD17A2, and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 remote sensing products. The TRMM 3B43 downscaled monthly precipitation data were used to calculate the tropical rainfall condition index (TRCI) for Yunnan. The TRCI was used as a drought index, and the temporal and spatial changes in TRCI, gross primary productivity (GPP), and vegetation condition index (VCI) from 2009 to 2018 were explored. The response of vegetation to drought was evaluated under different time scales and varying land-use types. The results showed that during 2009-2018, (1) at an annual scale, the drought in Yunnan showed a weakening trend, and at a spatial scale, the drought showed a weakening trend from northwest to southeast. This weakening trend was more noticeable for cultivated land than for forest, grassland, and other land-use types. (2) GPP and VCI showed overall increasing trends at an annual scale, indicating gradual improvements in the GPP of vegetation and vegetation status, whereas the summer vegetation index showed a decreasing trend. (3) Although both the GPP and the growth state of vegetation were affected by drought, the responses of GPP and VCI to drought differed under different temporal scales and different land-use types. The responses of GPP and VCI to drought during spring were greater than those over other seasons, and the response of VCI to drought was more sensitive than that of GPP. Drought had a high impact on the GPP and vegetation growth of cultivated land and grassland with shallow root systems, whereas the impact of drought on forest was relatively stable.",

      "title": "Evapotranspiration enhancement drives the European water-budget deficit during multi-year droughts",
      "journal": "Hydrology and Earth System Sciences",
      "citations": 1,
      "abstract": "In a warming climate, periods with lower than average precipitation will increase in frequency and intensity. During such periods, known as meteorological droughts, the decline in annual runoff may be proportionally larger than the corresponding decline in precipitation. Reasons behind this exacerbation of runoff deficit during dry periods remain largely unknown, and this challenges the predictability of when this exacerbation will occur in the future and how intense it will be. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that runoff deficit exacerbation during droughts is a common feature across climates, driven by evaporation enhancement. We relied on multidecadal records of streamflow and precipitation for more than 200 catchment areas across various European climates, which distinctively show the emergence of similar periods of exacerbated runoff deficit identified in previous studies, i.e. runoff deficit on the order of −20 % to −40 % less than what expected from precipitation deficits. The magnitude of this exacerbation is two to three times larger for basins located in dry regions than for basins in wet regions, and is qualitatively correlated with an increase in annual evaporation during droughts, in the order of +11 % and +33 % over basins characterized by energy-limited and water-limited evaporation regimes, respectively. Thus, enhanced atmospheric and vegetation demand for moisture during dry periods induces a nonlinear precipitation-runoff relationship for low-flow regimes, which results in an unexpectedly large decrease in runoff during periods of already low water availability. Forecasting onset, magnitude, and duration of these drops in runoff have paramount societal and ecological implications, especially in a warming climate, given their supporting role for safeguarding water, food, and energy. The outcome that water basins are prone to this exacerbation of runoff deficit for various climates and evaporation regimes makes further understanding of its patterns of predictability an urgent priority for water-resource planning and management in a warming and drier climate.",

In this study, non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and Sen’s slope were applied to analyze the spatiotemporal variabilities of vegetation coverage, precipitation, temperature and drought during the period 1981–2015 in the Yarlung Zangbo River basin (YZRB), based on GIMMS NDVI3g, CHIRPSv2.0, China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD) and CRU TS 4.03 (scPDSI) datasets. The Pearson Correlation Analysis and geostatistical methods were adopted to investigate the correlations between climatic variables and vegetation coverage as well as the time-lag effects for different vegetation types. The results showed that the spatial distribution of vegetation coverage is generally characterized as increasing from upper to lower reaches. The northwestern region of lower reaches showed a greening trend in vegetation, while degradation of vegetation was detected in southeastern region. The vegetation in the upper and middle reaches was significantly positively correlated with precipitation and drought, while a significantly negative correlation was detected between vegetation and temperature in the middle reaches and southeast region of the lower reaches, as well as vegetation and precipitation in the lower reaches. One-month lag effect of precipitation and temperature on vegetation appeared in the upper reaches, while no lag for precipitation and one-month lag for temperature were detected in the middle reaches, and both precipitation and temperature showed no lag effect on vegetation in southeast region of the lower reaches. The vegetation types in the YZRB were mainly consisted of meadow, alpine vegetation, shrubs and grassland, in which the growth of shrubs was relatively better than other vegetation types. All the four vegetation types showed a slightly greening trend, which were positively correlated with precipitation and drought, while showed a negative correlation with temperature. The findings help to better understand the mechanism of vegetation dynamics and provide references for ecosystem monitoring and assessment in the YZRB.",

Here, we used the Google Earth Engine to assess the droughts and floods and their impacts on croplands and crop production over 40 years from 1980 to 2019. Using the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) as the basis for determining the drought and flood levels, and crop damage levels, crop production loss in both the Monsoon Climate Region (MCR) and the Equatorial Climate Region (ECR) of Southeast Asia was assessed over 47,192 grid points with 10 × 10-kilometer resolution. We found that rainfed crops were severely affected by droughts in the MCR and floods in the ECR. About 9.42 million ha and 3.72 million ha of cropland was damaged by droughts and floods, respectively. We estimated a total loss of 20.64 million tons of crop production between 2015 and 2019. Rainfed crops in Thailand, Cambodia, and Myanmar were strongly affected by droughts, whereas Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia were more affected by floods over the same period. Accordingly, four levels of policy interventions were prioritized by considering the geolocated crop damage levels.",

      "abstract": "Building reservoirs is a response to cope with drought in drylands. However, this human modification to the landscape may trigger both positive and negative effects. Here, we investigate how a network of reservoirs influences the propagation of meteorological drought (MD) into hydrological drought (HD) in a large semi-arid catchment in Brazil. We applied 12-month standardized indices to classify droughts. Then, the drought series were compared to each other. The downstreamness concept was used to describe the spatial water distribution. The onset of reservoir drought (RD) was much later than MD, but the delay between MD and RD peaks was even longer. Streamflow drought started with a small delay after MD, but it transformed into a similar RD. RD was initially more severe downstream. When the drought severity was at its highest, upstream and downstream RD equalized. The perceptual model of drought propagation may help in developing reservoir management systems in drylands.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 4,
      "abstract": "Water supply management for hydroclimatic extremes has commonly been analysed using the cumulative difference between inflow and demand, a concept known as the Residual Mass Curve. This paper extends the residual mass concept to develop a new method to quantify water availability, termed the Residual Mass Severity Index (RMSI). The RMSI improves on the Residual Mass Curve by allowing extreme deficit periods to be easily identified without the need for manual inspection of the Residual Mass Curve. Another advantage of the RMSI is that it does not require a temporal window to be specified to characterise extreme deficit periods, which is needed for many drought indices such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). This paper develops the method for calculating the RMSI using precipitation time series and compares it to the SPI for different drought durations across Australia. Major hydroclimatic extremes during the instrumental period are assessed using RMSI, SPI, and by comparing the RMSI estimates with streamflow data from 467 catchments with varying sizes and climate across Australia. RMSI is a useful index for water managers interested in assessing water availability with potential applicability in summarising the features of historical hydroclimatic extremes as well as future changes in water availability due to anthropogenic climate change.",

      "abstract": "With a copula-based probabilistic model, this study presents a global view on the propagation of meteorological to soil moisture drought. Meta-Gaussian and three-dimensional vine copulas were employed to construct the bivariate and trivariate conditional joint drought distributions, respectively, using the time series of standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and standardized soil moisture index (SMI) derived from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) simulations. Three different cases, including the probability and magnitude of soil moisture drought (SMI) conditioned on 1-month meteorological drought (SPEI1), seasonal meteorological drought (SPEI3), and the joint effects of SPEI1 and antecedent soil moisture conditions (SMI lag-1 ), were analyzed. Then, the duration of soil moisture drought in response to meteorological drought, and potentially affected cropland area were analyzed to assess potential agricultural impacts. Results showed that the likelihood of soil moisture drought conditioned on SPEI1 in the Amazon rainforest, southern and eastern China, Southeast Asia, southeastern United States, and west Africa was generally higher than in other regions. Under the impact of seasonal meteorological drought, except for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China, northern Russia, and North Africa, the probability of soil moisture drought occurrence overall increased with significant increments in Europe and North America. The antecedent soil moisture condition also influenced the probability of drought propagation, and this effect was particularly significant for Northern China, Russia, the U.S. Midwest, Canada, and Australia. Spatially, the western U.S., northern Canada, South Africa, eastern Europe, North China, northern Russia, and most parts of Australia present longer duration of soil moisture drought in response to meteorological drought. Comprehensive considerations of the conditional probability, duration, and potentially affected area of soil moisture drought for croplands revealed that among five continents, South America was more vulnerable to agricultural drought under the condition of meteorological drought.",

      "abstract": "It is crucial to investigate how a precipitation deficit is transformed into hydrological drought and how climate change and human activities affect this transformation process, which is helpful to gain a deep understanding of drought propagation process in this changing environment. This study proposed an observation-based natural and human-impacted catchment comparison method to assess the impacts of climate change and human activities on propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought. The method mainly consists of the following three steps: (1) selection of natural catchments through analysis of trends and change points of hydro-meteorological data, as well as statistics analysis of human influence based on land use and socio-economic indicators data sets; (2) calculation of drought propagation characteristics (e.g., drought severity, duration, and propagation time) based on run theory and the Pearson correlation coefficient; and (3) comparison of drought propagation characteristics of natural catchments between undisturbed and disturbed periods to identify the impacts of climate change on drought propagation, and comparison of the propagation characteristics between natural and human-impacted catchments during the disturbed period to investigate human influence on drought propagation. The Laohahe basin (with eleven sub-catchments), located in northern China, was evaluated via the proposed procedure, and standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized runoff index (SRI) were used to characterize meteorological and hydrological droughts, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is suitable tool for distinguishing natural and human-impacted catchments, and separating the impacts of climate change and human activities on drought propagation. Furthermore, the comparison results of different schemes show that climate change accelerates the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought in the Laohahe basin, shortening it by approximately 3 months. Human activities, however, disturb and then delay the natural propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought, retarding it by 11–12 months. Although the Laohahe basin was selected as a case study in this paper, the proposed method can be applied in other regions as well to improve drought prediction and water resources management.",

      "abstract": "The traditional drought identification indices are usually based on the assumption of stationarity, which should no longer act as a fundamental and central theory of hydrological studies in global warming context. This study develops a time-varying framework for drought identification, characterization, and frequency analyzation: firstly, a nonstationary Standardized Precipitation Index (mnSPI) is developed to modify the time-varying linear relationships with both distribution parameters and clarify the explicit expressions incorporating large-scale climate indices as covariates as well. Then time-varying copulas are employed to evaluate the potential risk of drought events. As one of the most sensitive and vulnerable regions in response to climate change, the Jinsha River Basin (JRB) is selected as the study area to test the framework. Our results indicate that comparing with the traditional SPI, the mnSPI is superior in disclosing the trend of temporal and spatial changes of JRB over 1969–2018. In general, drought events have experienced a trend of first slowing down and then aggravating, while severely arid areas have shifted from the northwest to the central and eastern regions, and then to the southwest in JRB. Besides, it is likewise important to consider nonstationarity when carrying out the drought monitoring and early warning system (M&EW). Still more work needs to be done in dynamically identifying droughts involving teleconnection of climate factors.",

      "abstract": "Meteorological droughts propagate through the hydrological cycle causing hydrological droughts and societal impacts. However, the effects of climate and basin characteristics on hydrologic drought propagation vary regionally and remain largely unclear. In this paper, we characterize meteorological and hydrological droughts in 457 basins in Brazil. Using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI), we investigate hydrologic drought propagation based on differences in drought onset, the center of mass, and time to peak. Additionally, we estimate the recovery time of meteorological and hydrologic drought events. The results indicate that hydrological droughts are usually more long-lasting, severe, and with a slower recovery time compared to meteorological droughts. While the most severe meteorological droughts are observed in humid regions (e.g., Amazon and Southern Brazil), the most severe and long-lasting hydrological droughts are found in the driest region (i.e., Northeast Brazil) or mostly impacted by human activities (i.e., Southeast Brazil). Hydrological droughts in dry regions can take four times longer to recover than meteorological ones. For most regions, the propagation time was slightly different considering the different approaches. Our results highlight the importance of a multi-indicator approach to fully characterize the mechanisms controlling the development and propagation of droughts through the water cycle.",

This study aims to quantify the relative contributions of various human activities on hydrological droughts using “scenario comparison” method based on a calibrated PCR-GLOBWB model. New hydrological insights for the region The impacts on hydrological droughts by human activities exhibit large differences over time and space. In terms of time, non-irrigation water use (NWU) and irrigation water use (IWU) increased standardized drought streamflow deficit ( SDSD ) by about 119 % and 214 % on average during 1981–2010, respectively. In terms of space, NWU heavily increased SDSD in most regions of the basin, whereas reduced it in the regions with limited surface water due to the return flow from unconsumed water to surface water. IWU reduced SDSD in paddy irrigation regions due to large quantities of water in the upstream rivers were transferred to those regions for flooding irrigation, whereas in non-paddy irrigation regions IWU increased SDSD due to most of water being withdrawn locally and comparatively small quantity of water transfer. Reservoir operation (RO) reduced SDSD in downstream water receiving areas while increased SDSD in upstream areas. Our findings can help drought management and mitigation.",

      "abstract": "Groundwater depletion is a major threat to agricultural and municipal water supply in California's Central Valley. Recent droughts during 2007–2009 and 2012–2016 exacerbated chronic groundwater depletion. However, it is unclear how much groundwater storage recovered from drought‐related overdrafts during post‐drought years, and how climatic conditions and water management affected recovery times. We estimated groundwater storage change in the Central Valley for April 2002 through September 2019 using four methods: GRACE satellite data, a water balance approach, a hydrologic simulation model, and monitoring wells. We also evaluated the sensitivity of drought recovery to different climate scenarios (recent climate ± droughts and future climate change scenarios: 20 GCMs and 2 RCPs) using water balance method and statistical sampling of historical climate data. Estimated Central Valley groundwater loss during the two droughts ranged from 19 km 3 (2007–2009) to 28 km 3 (2012–2016) (median of four methods). Median aquifer storage recovery was 34% and 19% of the overdraft during the 2010–2011 and 2017–2019 post‐drought years, respectively. Numerical experiments show that recovery times are sensitive to climate forcing, with longer recovery times for a future climate scenario that replicate historical climatology relative to historical forcing with no droughts. Overdraft recovery times decrease by ∼2× with implementation of pumping restrictions (30th to 50th percentiles of historical groundwater depletion) to constrain groundwater depletion relative to no restrictions with a no‐drought future climatology. This study highlights the importance of considering water management implications for future drought recoveries within the context of climate change scenarios.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 69,
      "abstract": "Of particular importance in a world of increasing water scarcity is the temporal and spatial relationship between a shortage in rainfall—meteorological drought—and a shortage in available water, or hydrological drought. Propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought should be calculated at a higher (sub-monthly) temporal resolution with considerations for spatial expansion. A new framework for propagation time calculation from one index to another is established that uses the run theory, high-resolution remote sensing data on a daily time step. The framework is demonstrated using standardized drought indices representing precipitation, runoff, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture in the Central Asian subcontinent to measure the temporal shift (propagation time) in affected drought area, bringing a new perspective to contemporary drought analysis. Several variables from the water cycle are chosen to provide hydrological context for different propagation times. Correlation analyses for propagation time are shown to be ambiguous in interpretation and precision when compared to the temporal shift, which is clearly defined and calculated on a daily time step. Moreover, the results of temporal shift analyses indicate that deficits in evapotranspiration and runoff can precede deficits in precipitation, while soil moisture deficit almost always follows, highlighting the effects of additional influencing factors aside from precipitation on types of hydrological drought. While it is limited by current understanding of drought definition techniques, availability and quality of remote sensing products, and selection of characteristics for observation, use of the temporal shift over the correlation analysis provides a sub-monthly estimate of drought propagation time that may prove useful for detailed analyses, particularly in rapidly developing flash drought events.",

      "citations": 27,
      "abstract": "Managing water–human systems during water shortages or droughts is key to avoid the overexploitation of water resources and, in particular, groundwater. Groundwater is a crucial water resource during droughts as it sustains both environmental and anthropogenic water demand. Drought management is often guided by drought policies, to avoid crisis management, and actively introduced management strategies. However, the impact of drought management strategies on hydrological droughts is rarely assessed. In this study, we present a newly developed socio-hydrological model, simulating the relation between water availability and managed water use over 3 decades. Thereby, we aim to assess the impact of drought policies on both baseflow and groundwater droughts. We tested this model in an idealised virtual catchment based on climate data, water resource management practices and drought policies in England. The model includes surface water storage (reservoir), groundwater storage for a range of hydrogeological conditions and optional imported surface water or groundwater. These modelled water sources can all be used to satisfy anthropogenic and environmental water demand. We tested the following four aspects of drought management strategies: (1) increased water supply, (2) restricted water demand, (3) conjunctive water use and (4) maintained environmental flow requirements by restricting groundwater abstractions. These four strategies were evaluated in separate and combined scenarios. Results show mitigated droughts for both baseflow and groundwater droughts in scenarios applying conjunctive use, particularly in systems with small groundwater storage. In systems with large groundwater storage, maintaining environmental flows reduces hydrological droughts most. Scenarios increasing water supply or restricting water demand have an opposing effect on hydrological droughts, although these scenarios are in balance when combined at the same time. Most combined scenarios reduce the severity and occurrence of hydrological droughts, given an incremental dependency on imported water that satisfies up to a third of the total anthropogenic water demand. The necessity for importing water shows the considerable pressure on water resources, and the delicate balance of water–human systems during droughts calls for short-term and long-term sustainability targets within drought policies.",

      "abstract": "Drought is a complex, multifaceted, and one of the most widespread natural disasters causing an economic loss of billions of dollars. Drought declaration is crucial since it signifies the beginning of states's response to drought. India's current drought management policy is specified in the Manual for Drought Management 2016. While the manual provides comprehensive guidelines to states and regional Drought Monitoring Centres (DMC's) for monitoring and declaration of droughts, assessing the current drought detection framework and its suitability in different regions has been lacking. Using gridded products of precipitation, soil moisture, and remote sensing indicators, we examine the differences between detected and declared droughts for all the districts in India during the 2000-2017 period. Comparison of detected and declared droughts show a higher probability of detection (POD) in central India. In contrast, lower POD was found in regions of high drought susceptibility like Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Large differences between the detected and declared droughts were identified in the irrigated regions of Punjab and Gangetic Plain. The use of Solar-induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) instead of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a remote sensing indicator improved drought detection (based on POD and false alarm ratio, FAR) in central and western parts of India. The framework specified in the drought manual detects most of the major droughts that affected a large part of the country. However, regional droughts in Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Karnataka are frequently missed. Finally, we highlight the limitations in the existing drought monitoring framework and opportunities for its enhancement.",

      "abstract": "As the critical parameter of the agricultural drought process, soil moisture (SM) has the potential to monitor agricultural drought, which can provide practical support for water management. In this study, a drought index, namely Soil Dryness Index (SDI), was proposed based on long-term gridded ERA-5 land SM, and its performance was evaluated. Furthermore, we employed the run theory and copula to study the spatiotemporal drought characteristics based on this index in Inner Mongolia. Although the return period of drought events has been assessed in many studies, the drought tends to occur with a nonstationary frequency. The wavelet transform was then applied to drought area proportion time series in sub-regions to study the temporal characteristics of droughts. The results show that SDI performs well in monitoring agricultural drought. There is strong heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of drought events. Frequent and low-severity droughts dominated arid and semi-arid regions, while some high-severity droughts mainly occurred in humid and semi-humid regions (mainly in Hulunbuir and Xing'an). The droughts, especially those with high severity, have become much more frequent in the last two decades. The period from 2000 to 2010 had seen more frequent droughts in recent 40 years, and most 20-year return period droughts occurred during this period. These findings could contribute to a better understanding of spatiotemporal patterns of agricultural droughts and provide a reference for future drought trends in Inner Mongolia.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 75,
      "abstract": "The construction of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has exerted substantial effects on local hydrological regime and eco-system since its operation in 2003. Due to this significant anthropogenic activity, drought propagation processes from Meteorological drought to Hydrological (M-H) and Soil moisture (M-S) drought are inevitably modified. However, current studies are still insufficient to answer whether the TGD operation mitigated or exacerbated the drought propagation process due to its complex impacts. To explore this key issue, this study proposed an integrated framework to quantify the impact of TGD construction on drought propagation process in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). The drought characteristics propagation models and propagation time were calculated to identify the modification of drought propagation process between different TGD operation scenarios. Trend and attribution analyses were also utilized to explore potential influence factors. Results demonstrated that TGD construction did significantly aggravate the drought characteristics propagation. Specifically, the slopes of hydrological drought duration and severity in linear propagation models increased 23.98% and 29.23% in average. While for M-S propagation, the slopes of duration and severity models increased 28.72% and 21.91%, respectively. This research also found that, after TGD operation, the M-H propagation speed had been slowed down but the M-S lag time became shorter. Additionally, the variations and trend patterns of six potential influence factors at four separate periods were full analyzed to provide implications for the drought propagation modifications. And TGD operation was confirmed to become a major factor inducing the variations of annual runoff, which accounted for 56.75% for the entire YRB. The above quantitative findings are expected to reveal the potential changes of drought propagation process caused by the construction of TGD in YRB. The proposed integrated framework is also beneficial to the drought early warning system and understanding of drought development not only in YRB, but also in other basins at the global scale.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 27,
      "abstract": "Regulation of streamflow by large reservoirs alters the characteristics of hydrological drought. However, few studies have focused on the impacts of regulation on the water required ( WR ) for hydrological drought recovery, nor on the response relationship between WR and drought characteristics (i.e., duration and severity). Therefore, we proposed a comparative approach that integrates reconstructing unregulated streamflow and a drought identification method using variable threshold levels ( VTL s) to evaluate the impacts. Long-term (>40 years) observational datasets for streamflow at a hydrometric station and inflow and outflow at multiple large reservoirs in the Dongjiang River Basin were used. Using VTL s that accounted for seasonal differences in hydrological processes, our method performed well in identifying historical hydrological droughts and their characteristics in the study area. The WR mainly depended on drought severity rather than drought duration and there was a clear nonlinear response relationship (i.e., power function) between WR and drought severity. The performance indices (i.e., R 2 = 0.92, NSE = 0.97, PBIAS = 13.57%) indicated that the optimal nonlinear function model could accurately simulate the WR of hydrological drought events. Large reservoirs reduce the frequency of hydrological droughts, shorten drought duration, and reduce drought severity by storing water in the flood season and releasing it in the dry season. The presence of reservoirs shifted the relationship between WR and drought severity from linear to nonlinear. These findings showed that the proposed methodology can help us to optimize the management of water resources for drought prevention and disaster reduction under changing environments.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 58,
      "abstract": "This paper investigates the impacts of climate change on groundwater droughts making use of regional projections and standardized indices: the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the Standardized Groundwater Index (SGI). The method adopted, using historical precipitation and temperature data and water levels collected in monitoring wells, first investigates the possible correlations between meteorological and groundwater indices at each well. Then, if there is a correlation, a linear regression analysis is used to model the relationships between SGIs and SPIs, and SGIs and SPEIs. The same relationships are used to infer future SGIs from SPI and SPEI projections obtained by means of an ensemble of Regional Climate Models (RCMs), under different climate scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). This methodology has been applied to data collected in northern Tuscany (Italy) in an area served by a water company, where historical series of daily climate variables (since 1934) and daily records for 16 wells, covering the period 2005–2020, are available. The impacts on groundwater have been computed in the short- (2006–2035), medium- (2036–2065) and long-term (2066–2095). The analysis indicates that, in the historical period and for most of the monitoring wells, there is a good correlation between SGIs and SPIs or SPEIs. The results point out that making use of the SGI-SPI relationships, slight variations in the availability of groundwater are expected in the future. However, in a global warming scenario, the influence of temperature on evapotranspiration phenomena cannot be overlooked and, for this reason, the SGI-SPEI relationships seem more suitable to forecast groundwater droughts. According to these relationships, negative effects on groundwater levels in almost all wells are estimated for the future. For the RCP 4.5 scenario, the largest decline in groundwater level is expected in the medium-term, while for the RCP 8.5 scenario future SGIs will significantly decrease over the long-term. Due to the type of data required and its simplicity, this methodology can be applied to different areas of interest for a quick estimate of groundwater availability under climate change scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Drought is among the costliest natural disasters and its spatiotemporal scales are larger than those of other water‐related disasters. However, our understanding of drought causative mechanisms is less than complete, inhibiting accurate drought forecasting and early warning. While sea surface temperature teleconnection governs the 10%–60% precipitation variability at intra‐seasonal to multiannual scales, some of the unexplained variability can be understood by internal atmospheric variability, represented by Rossby wave packets (RWPs), and implications of atmospheric rivers (ARs). The amplitude and phase speed of the recurrent RWPs (RRWPs) and the atmospheric river index developed in this study were used to analyze the impacts of RWPs and ARs on droughts detected by three‐dimensional drought clustering algorithms for the continental U.S. during 1951–2015. The occurrence of RRWPs raised the likelihood of the occurrence of more severe drought than did the non‐occurrence of RRWPs. The increase in the occurrence of RRWPs with low phase speed escalated drought severity, area, and duration. Furthermore, the drying ARs affected drought by increasing the severity and area of extreme droughts. We measured the level of contributions of RRWPs and ARs to extreme drought occurrences. The drying ARs contributed more to extreme droughts than did RRWPs. However, the co‐occurrence of ARs and RRWPs contributed more than did each individually. Our findings of the implications of RRWPs and ARs on drought characteristics offer the potential to improve our understanding of drought causative mechanisms that can enhance the proactive drought mitigation measures.",

Traditionally, they are characterized considering a univariate perspective. However, this approach may not be the most adequate to characterize such hazards as they often result from a combination of variables interacting in space and time. Alternatively, several studies adopt the multivariate frequency analysis as it allows the consideration of concurrent drivers and their dependencies. Nevertheless, few of them evaluated this methodology in a climate change context. In view of this, this study aims to compare the uni and multivariate approaches to characterize extreme drought events considering both historical and future scenarios, using the severe water crisis experienced in the southeast region of Brazil in 2014–2015 as a study case. New hydrological insights for the region The univariate approach can substantially underestimate the risk associated with extreme events. For future scenarios, differences between the two methodologies reached 90% of the estimated return period. Significant increasing trends were found only for temperature. Both approaches indicated that drought events will be more common and intense in the future. However, the univariate framework may misspecificate the associated risks, as it not account for the expected warming condition that may trigger or exacerbate extreme drought events.",

      "abstract": "Flash droughts are regional phenomena that can manifest in large areas with rapid intensification for a period of time. Few studies have considered the spatial pathways of flash droughts or their drought period. This study uses the five criteria based on the standardized evaporative stress ratio (SESR) method to identify flash droughts, and when a SESR value recovers to the 20th percentile, the flash drought is considered to terminate. To define spatially continuous flash droughts accurately, the usual order of first calculating drought patches and then identifying flash droughts is reversed to first identify flash droughts on the grid and then determine flash drought patches. In addition, this study tracks the spatial paths of flash droughts via centroid transfers of flash drought patches. Using MOD16 data, the methodology is evaluated by analyzing the regional characteristics of flash droughts in the Huaibei Plain of China from 2001 to 2019. The flash droughts in this region most frequently tracked in the northeast and west. The average flash drought duration was 31 days, of which the rapid intensification period was 18 days and drought period was 14 days. Flash drought events in this region mostly occurred in May, August and October, and east to west transition and non-transitions, which accounted for 44% and 22%, respectively, were the main spatial track paths. Only 26% of flash drought events transitioned to long term drought events. This study expands our knowledge of the evolution process of flash droughts to space-time dimensions, which is essential for flash droughts early warning and agricultural water management.",

      "abstract": "With the accelerated climate change, the selection of globe-warming related drought monitoring tools is vitally significant. To select the most suitable multi-source precipitation product for drought monitoring, this study comprehensively evaluated the performance of 7 latest version of multi-source precipitation estimate products (MPEs, including PERSIANN-CDR, CHIRPS, ERA5, MERRA2, APHRODITE, GPCC and MSWEP) and compared their drought monitoring applicability combined with GLEAM potential evapotranspiration (ET P ) product based on the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) during 1983–2015 over China. The SPEI estimated by the China monthly Precipitation Analysis Product (CPAP) was used as the reference to assess their performance. In addition, the drought area ratio, frequency, duration and intensity were analyzed based on the multi-threshold run theory. The results showed that: (1) The precision of MPEs was higher in eastern China but lower in western China, and the overall accuracy of MPEs summarized as 4 levels from top to end respectively was GPCC and APHRODITE, MERRA2 and MSWEP, CHIRPS and PERSIANN-CDR as well as ERA5. GLEAM ET P performed well in eastern China but poor in western China with large underestimations. (2) The applicability of MPEs in drought monitoring was regional-specific (low in parts of Northwest Desert and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but high in other areas). The accuracy of estimated SPEI for most MPEs dropped with expanding timescale in most sub-regions. Among of MPEs, GPCC product comprehensively performed best in drought monitoring. (3) Drought events occurring in northern China were usually with larger area ratio, lower frequency and longer duration than other regions. Drought events had an exacerbating trend in southeastern China. Overall, this study provides significant information to choose suitable datasets for globe-warming related drought studies.",

      "abstract": "Warmer and shorter winters from climate change will reduce snowpacks in most seasonally snow-covered regions of the world, with consequences for freshwater availability in spring and summer when people and ecosystems demand water most. Recent record-low snowpacks, such as those in the winters of 2013/14 and 2014/15 in the western United States, have led to a surge in research on “snow droughts,” which are pointed to as harbingers of global warming that pose significant societal hazards. Yet, despite the importance of understanding snow droughts to best prepare for their attendant impacts, the concept remains amorphous, with no agreed-upon definition of what they are, how best to measure them, and how such snow droughts connect to warm-season impacts. These knowledge gaps limit our understanding of the risks posed by snow droughts in the present and future, and thus our preparedness for their differential impacts on freshwater resources. To address these issues, we compile a hemispheric ensemble of in situ, satellite, and reanalysis snowpack datasets. We use this ensemble to evaluate the scientific challenges and uncertainties arising from differences in defining and measuring snow droughts, and to identify opportunities to leverage this information to better understand the significance of snow droughts. We show that a clearer quantification of what constitutes a snow drought, including its uncertainties, improves our ability to anticipate costly and disruptive warm-season droughts, which is vital for informing risk management and adaptation to changing snow regimes.",

      "citations": 13,
      "abstract": "Different indicators such as precipitation, surface and groundwater availability, vegetation, and soil types are indispensable in developing land management plans for detecting, monitoring, and evaluating drought impacts at the watershed scale. Because of the complex interactions among these indicators, it is well known that one single hydrometeorological variable would be unable to capture all the aspects of drought characteristics. In this study, a methodology based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-Copula was proposed to assess the frequency of different drought events and improve mitigation in watersheds. A comprehensive approach for an Integrated Drought Indicator (IDI) was proposed using a combination of three hydrometeorological variables (precipitation, runoff, and soil moisture) based on PCA and tested for the upstream Nanpan river in China. IDI confirmed the cumulative contribution rate of the first and second principal components (85%), and its design included simulation of monthly average soil moisture content (from 0 to 0.4-meter soil layer) using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The parameters were calibrated using the SUFI-2 optimization algorithm in SWAT-CUP. Then, the IDI relative anomaly characterization was used to identify drought processes based on the Run theory. Two major drought characteristics, duration, and severity were abstracted from the observed drought events. Finally, two-dimensional copulas were applied for analyzing comprehensive drought characteristics in the region. Our results showed that significant differences in drought duration periods could be identified. Drought duration, predicted by runoff and soil moisture, were found longer than those assessed using the precipitation index. IDI suggest our proposed model was suitable to identify comprehensive drought events and describe the overall drought characteristics of the region. In the same way, PCA-Copula methodology was found with high potential for drought analysis in areas where no previous studies have been performed.",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies have projected that drought will become more severe under changing climatic conditions which will have a profound impact on terrestrial ecosystems around the world. While a wide range of drought indices has been extensively applied to assess droughts, various issues have been raised, such as over- or underestimation of drought conditions, feature extraction techniques, or transformations used to develop the indices. In this study, a new composite drought index (CDI) was developed using the integration of potential and actual evapotranspiration, climatic water balance, and precipitation. The proposed CDI was evaluated by comparing it with soil moisture, Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), scaled crop yield index (sCYI), evaluation integrated drought index (EIDI), and standardized runoff index (SRI) in China. Our results demonstrate that together with PDSI, CDI performs well in monitoring drought over 2417 grid cells obtained from in-situ latitude and longitude. It was found that CDI performs better than the PDSI and EIDI for reliable soil moisture detection and stable drought monitoring in the study area. Compared to PDSI, CDI shows a more positive correlation with sCYI for seasonal maize and wheat. CDI has less false alarm ratio in the detection of mild to extreme drought events compared to PDSI.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 64,
      "abstract": "Under global warming, droughts have become more severe and more frequent. In this context, it is widely accepted that both water supply (e.g., precipitation, PRE) and demand (e.g., potential evapotranspiration, PET) should be considered in drought assessments due to increasing evapotranspiration. China’s Yellow River basin is located mainly in arid and semi-arid regions that suffer severe droughts. Analyzing the temporal and spatial patterns of droughts in this area and exploring the relative effects of supply and demand on drought occurrence and variations are thus necessary to adapt to increased droughts. Here, we compared three kinds of drought indices, including the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), the standardized precipitation index (SPI), and the standardized evapotranspiration deficit Index (SEDI), and used SPEI to identify droughts in the Yellow River basin during the six decades from 1956 to 2016. We identified droughts and described drought dynamics based on drought duration, intensity, frequency, and spatial extent. We then evaluated the relative contributions of PRE and PET to droughts of varying severity and long-term trend, as well as the relationships between ocean signals and droughts. Our results show that most of the basin has undergone progressively drier conditions since the 1950 s. This increased drought occurrence has manifested as longer, more frequent droughts affecting a larger spatial extent. PRE was the dominant driver (64%) of drought occurrence in an area of ∼ 86% of the basin, whereas PET was the main driver (55%) in the remaining 14% of the basin. However, changes in PET contributed more than PRE to drought variation, i.e., long-term SPEI trends, in about ∼ 60% of the area. And effects of PET increased during severer droughts due to the intensive interaction between soil moisture and atmospheric water demand in highly arid conditions. Physically, droughts were closely related to several ocean signals, such as the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation index (AMO), and the Arctic Oscillation index (AO), at different time scales. Understandings of drought dynamics, their physical mechanisms, and the effects of PRE and PET on droughts of varying severity are essential for water resource management, especially in arid regions.",

      "abstract": "In this study, the spatial–temporal variability of hydrological drought in Meriç Basin, Turkey, has been examined, and its relationship with global climate oscillations has been explored. Prior to drought analysis, streamflow data gaps were filled, and series homogeneity was examined. The standardized streamflow index (SSFI) was used to detect drought periods from monthly streamflow data of nine stations well spread over the study area. The hydrological drought intensity, magnitude, and duration were investigated using the SSFI time series. The drought variability was assessed by performing trend analysis and wavelet transforms. Trend analysis showed an increase in drought events in the Northern region and a decrease in the Southern region of the basin. Wavelet analysis reveals that the 4–10 year scales explicate the drought series pattern. The identification of climate patterns that are most associated with drought variability is performed via correlation analysis. The investigation showed that distinct climate patterns simultaneously influence drought events. Significantly, the influence of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) is notable. The analysis demonstrated a remarkable correlation between ENSO and SSFI series at the interannual scale (2–8 years). The obtained phase difference suggests that the maximum dry (wet) conditions coincide with La Nina (El Nino) events. In addition, positive NAO phases and negative AMO phases lead to drought occurrence.",

      "abstract": "Rapid onset droughts, termed as “flash droughts”, cause short-term but serious threats to terrestrial ecosystems and influence carbon dynamics due to insufficient warning. To date, how the regional terrestrial carbon dynamics respond to flash droughts in India remains unknown. Since, India is highly dependent on its cropland and vegetation, identifying the influence of flash droughts on terrestrial ecosystem is important. Here we use MODIS remote sensing satellite sensor based gross primary productivity (GPP) and remote sensing-based soil moisture data to compute the response of ecosystems to flash droughts in India. From the investigation, it was observed that GPP responds to more than 95% of the flash droughts across India, with the highest response frequency occurring over Ganga basin and southern India while the lowest response across northeastern India. The discrepancies in the response frequencies are mainly attributed to different vegetation resilience conditions across different parts of the country. Moreover, the mean response time is about 10 to 19 days averaged over India, with the lowest and highest response time over Indus-Ganga basins and northeastern Indian river basins (including the Brahmaputra, Minor rivers draining into Myanmar basin (MRMB), and Barak basins), respectively. Severe reduction in water use efficiency (WUE) was observed for the Ganga river basin and some parts of southern India, which highlighted the non-resilient nature of ecosystem towards rapid soil moisture variations. The study facilitates the identification of flash drought hotspots in the country including the Indus basin, Southern river basins (Cauveri, EFRPCP, and EFRSCB basins), some parts of the Ganga basin, and the ability of an ecosystem to withstand such drastic conditions. These findings highlight the need to adopt essential drought mitigation measures to safeguard the sustainability of ecosystems.",

      "abstract": "Drought‐affected regions often contain high densities of small reservoirs, usually informally built, as drought‐coping mechanism. These structures influence socio‐hydrological dynamics and have the potential to alter hydrological processes relevant to drought emergence and development. This study aimed to analyze the influence of a high concentration of small reservoirs on the intensification and evolution of drought events. We present an innovative method, which we call “Drought Cycle Analysis”, that tracks the concomitance of precipitation and water storage deficit and associates this with four drought stages: Wet Period, Meteorological drought, Hydro‐meteorological drought and Hydrological drought period. The methodology was tested for the Riacho do Sangue River watershed located in the semi‐arid region of northeast Brazil. We used a combination of satellite imagery (Landsat 5, 7 and 8) and an empirical equation to estimate the volume stored in the dense network of small reservoirs. Using the Drought Cycle Analysis, we show that the unmonitored small reservoirs induced and modified drought events, extending the duration of hydrological drought on average by 30%. Furthermore, this extension can double for specific drought events. The Drought Cycle Analysis method proved useful for monitoring and comparing the evolution of different drought events, in addition to being applicable as an auxiliary tool in the improvement of water resources management of large reservoirs. This study demonstrates the importance of considering small reservoirs in water resource management strategy development for drought‐prone regions.",

Much attention has been recently focused on the propagation from meteorological drought (MD) to hydrological drought (HD); however, the influences of human activities on drought propagation have rarely been explored. The novelty of the study was to propose an effective framework to quantify the impacts of human activities on MD-HD propagation. We adopted the framework to comprehensively evaluate the anthropic impacts on hydrological drought variations and time, thresholds, and probabilities of MD-HD propagation in the Weihe River Basin (WRB) during different periods. The results showed that human activities did significantly disturb HD variations and MD-HD propagation characteristics. Specifically, human activities increased the frequency and extremes of HD and weakened its correlation with MD. The MD-HD propagation characteristics showed spatiotemporal differences across three subbasins because of the different levels of human activities. The thresholds of MD triggering different levels of HD generally became larger with change rates from 1% to 143% and 3% to more than 189% during two periods, respectively. Meanwhile, we also found that the thresholds became distinctly smaller, which could only be observed in spring and winter. Moreover, the relationship between natural and human-induced probabilities of HD occurrence showed three patterns with the increase of MD severity. The quantitative results of this study can provide guide information on adaptation strategies to promote drought preparedness in the WRB. The proposed framework can be also applied in other regions to improve the understanding of hydrological drought mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Investigating the characteristics and influencing factors of groundwater drought, and identifying their difference in the regions with different climate conditions can provide an essential reference for the sustainable management of groundwater resources. As a case study in the two largest and typical catchments in China, the temporal evolution, spatial distribution and trend characteristics of groundwater drought are identified by GRACE-based groundwater drought index in the Yangtze River catchments (YZRC) with a humid climate condition, and Yellow River catchments (YRC) with an arid/semi-arid climate condition. Their influencing factors, which include natural net recharge (P-ET), teleconnection factors (ENSO, PDO and AO), and anthropogenic factors (land use and land cover, LULC), are investigated and quantitatively compared based on Pearson correlation analysis, cross wavelet transform and Random Forest. The results indicate that: (1) The groundwater droughts in the YZRC mainly occur during 2002–2009, which are mostly in the middle and lower reaches of the catchments, and they show a decreasing trend in most regions of the catchments. In the YRC, they mainly occur during 2015–2019, which influence almost the whole catchments, and they show an increasing trend in most regions of the catchments. (2) The P-ET has a significant positive impact on the mitigation of groundwater drought in the YZRC, while it fails to reverse the groundwater drought aggravation in the YRC. The teleconnection factors have obvious influences on groundwater drought evolution, among which Arctic Oscillation (AO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are the important factors affecting groundwater drought in the YZRC and YRC, respectively. For LULC, the decrease of cropland and grassland could alleviate groundwater drought in the YZRC, and the increase of grassland, forest and urban area in the YRC could aggravate groundwater drought in the catchments. (3) When quantitatively comparing the contributions, the LULC and P-ET are the crucial factors affecting groundwater drought in the two catchments, while in the YRC, the impact of teleconnection factors cannot be ignored, although it is relatively weak. Moreover, groundwater exploitation plays an important role on groundwater drought in the YZRC and YRC. Its contribution in the YZRC and YRC is slightly lower than that of P-ET, but obviously higher than that of teleconnection factors.",

      "abstract": "This study presents a new data set of gauged streamflow (N = 3,224) for Europe spanning the period 1962–2017. The Monthly Streamflow of Europe Dataset (MSED) is freely available at http://msed.csic.es/. Based on this data set, changes in the characteristics of hydrological drought (i.e., frequency, duration, and severity) were assessed for different regions of Europe. Due to the density of the database, it is possible to delimit spatial patterns in hydrological droughts trend with the greatest detail available to date. Results reveal bidirectional changes in monthly streamflow, with negative changes predominating over central and southern Europe, while positive trends dominate over northern Europe. Temporally, two dominant patterns were noted. The first pattern corresponds to a consistent downward trend in all months, evident for southern Europe. A second pattern was noted over central and northern Europe and western France, with a predominant negative trend during warm months and a positive trend in cold months. For hydrological drought events, results suggest a positive trend toward more frequent and severe droughts in southern and central Europe and conversely a negative trend over northern Europe. This study emphasizes that hydrological droughts show complex spatial patterns across Europe over the past six decades, implying that hydrological drought behavior in Europe has a regional character. Accordingly it is challenging to adopt “efficient” strategies and policies to monitor and mitigate drought impacts at the continental level.",

Though many studies have evaluated changes in individual hydrological droughts and high temperature extremes, the impact of climate change on their concurrences (or compound extremes) is still lacking. In this study, we investigated changes in compound hydrological droughts and high temperature extremes (CHDHEs) for the period 1961-2016 in the Luanhe River Basin, a semi-arid basin of China. We employed the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to simulate runoff, based on which the temporal and spatial variation of CHDHEs was investigated. Results showed that the frequency of CHDHEs increased by 160% from 1961 to 1988 to the recent period 1989-2016. At the spatial scale, a significant increase in the frequency of CHDHEs was shown over 67.37% of the study area. Temperature was shown to play a significant role in the variation of CHDHEs with an average contribution of 57.57%. Results in this study can provide valuable insights for understanding the risk of compound droughts and high temperature extremes in the Luanhe River Basin under global warming.",

      "citations": 69,
      "abstract": "As the most widespread natural hazard, drought has significant impacts on the livelihood and ecosystems in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin (LMRB). However, few studies focus on the seasonal characteristics of drought in the LMRB, especially under future climate projections by the Sixth Phase of Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP6). This study filled the knowledge gap using SPI and SPEI, based on eight GCMs of CMIP6 under three scenarios (i.e., SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5). Our results show that the LMRB tends to experience wetter wet season and drier dry season with the rising temperature considered (based on SPEI), while the temporal trend of dry-season SPI is not significant. The future trends of SPEI are -0.006 per year and -0.011 per year under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, respectively. The trend magnitudes demonstrate spatial heterogeneities. Our evaluation based on SPEI shows that the most notable increases of dry-season drought (in terms of duration and intensity) are distributed in the middle reaches of LMRB. The upper Lancang and middle Mekong basin will likely experience more wet-season droughts. The dry-season drought accounts for 60% of total drought events in the near future (i.e., 2021–2055) and more than 80% in the far future (i.e., 2061–2095) under SSP2-4.5. Effective strategies are needed to enhance food and drinking water security in the LMRB, especially for the dry seasons under a changing climate.",

In this study, the Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) Groundwater Drought Index (GDI) were used for assessing meteorological and groundwater droughts, respectively, in the North China Plain (NCP). The Directed Information Transfer Index (DITI) was used to identify the propagation from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts. The verification results indicated good reliability of GRACE data for assessing drought events in the NCP. From the view of temporal variation, the SPEI-1 was first decreased and then increased, and the minimum value was in 2011. The GDI was first increased and then decreased, and the maximum was in 2008. In terms of spatial distribution, the SPEI-1 significantly decreased in the central part of the NCP before 2011. The 2011–2020 period revealed an increasing trend in SPEI-1 in many parts of the NCP. According to the GDI results, an increasing trend was observed in the central and western parts of the NCP before 2008, and many parts of the study region revealed a decreasing trend in GDI during the 2008–2020 period. The propagation time of SPEI-1 to GDI was long in spring and winter and short in summer. The maximum DITI values ranged from 0.4 to 0.9 and the most spread time was about 18 to 24 months in the northern and southern parts of Hebei and the northern part of Henan province, covering 36.40% of the total surface area of the NCP. Regarding the drought sensitivity and propagation rate, the dominated distribution was in a pattern of high in the northern and low in southern parts of the NCP, with the rates of 38.44% and 34.17%, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Recent drought events in the Mekong River Basin (MRB) have resulted in devastating environmental and economic losses, and climate change and human-induced alterations have exacerbated drought conditions. Using hydrologic models and multiple climate change scenarios, this study quantified the future climate change impacts on conventional and flash drought conditions in the MRB. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) models were applied to estimate long-term drought indices for conventional and flash drought conditions over historical and future periods (1966–2099), using two emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP8.5), and four climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). For the conventional drought assessment, monthly scale drought indices were estimated, and pentad-scale (5 days) drought indices were computed for the flash drought evaluations. There were overall increases in droughts from the SWAT model for the conventional drought conditions and overall decreases from the VIC model. For the flash drought conditions, the SWAT-driven drought indices showed overall increases in drought occurrences (up to 165%). On the contrary, the VIC-driven drought indices presented decreases in drought occurrences (up to −44%). The conventional and flash drought evaluations differ between these models as they partition the water budget, specifically soil moisture differently. We conclude that the proposed framework, which includes hydrologic models, various emission scenarios, and projections, allows us to assess the various perspectives on drought conditions. Basin countries have differential impacts, so targeted future adaptation strategy is required.",

      "abstract": "Agricultural drought poses a serious threat to national food security, and the investigation on the propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought plays an important role in drought mitigation and social stability. Nevertheless, the seasonal dynamic propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought and its dominant influence factors in a changing environment remain unresolved. To this end, the meteorological drought and agricultural drought are characterized by the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSMI), respectively. The propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought is determined by selecting the maximum conditional probability value between SPI with various timescales and SSMI with time scale of 1 month (SSMI-1). Furthermore, the seasonal dynamic propagation patterns are obtained based on the moving window and Mann-Kendall trend test. Subsequently, the influence factors are explored based on the diverse hydro-meteorological factors and irrigation water consumption. The Wei River Basin (WRB), a typical arid and semi-arid as well as an important agricultural production area in China, is taken as the research object. Results manifest that: (1) it is more suitable to determine the drought propagation time by conditional probability method considering linear and nonlinear relations simultaneously; (2) the seasonal propagation time of the whole basin is getting shorter as a whole, especially in the main stream basin; (3) the increasing temperature and decreasing soil moisture and precipitation have strong effects on the propagation dynamics while irrigation water consumption has a little influence, and teleconnection factors may indirectly affect drought propagation by influencing hydro-meteorological factors. Overall, it is of great significance to study the propagation of meteorological drought to agricultural drought for drought prevention, drought resistance and food security.",

New hydrological insights for the region The period of SPI-12 lies around 2–7 years, while the period of SPI-3 is at the time scale of 1–3 years, indicating potential teleconnections with large-scale climate events. Moreover, MIROC6 and CESM2 models exhibited better performance in simulating precipitation than individual models and multi-model ensemble mean. The uncertainties of the model ensemble mean of 3 selected models in depicting droughts have a good consistency with the observations. The projection experiments of CMIP6 derived from the selected historical simulation models can be used to predict drought in the near future and the far future under different scenarios over the Huaihe River Basin.",

It evaluates the soil moisture deficit or surplus with spatial and temporal changes for the Marathwada region consisting of eight districts for 1957–2017. The analyzis shows water surplus from July to September and water deficit from November to May. The study observes that the Marathwada is drought-free during the Kharif season and water deficit in Rabi season. This study analyzes the need for crop-shift to avoid crop damage during drought. Based on the analyzis, all the urban system sectors need to augment short-term and long-term policies to overcome the water crisis for a balanced water resource. The Self-Calibrated PDSI (ScPDSI) is calculated based on PDSI, which gives more freedom in analyzing the drought period. Highlights Water balancing approach can effectively help in modelling the rapid depletion of water resources. This work expands the use of drought indicators for water balancing by evaluating the soil moisture deficit or surplus with spatial and temporal changes for the Marathwada region for 1957–2017. Urban system sectors may augment short-term and long-term policies based on the framework to overcome the water crisis for a balanced water resource.",

Therefore, the identification of droughts and an analysis of their driving factors are of significant importance for mitigating local drought losses and guiding agricultural practices. This study identified the spatiotemporal distribution and dynamic changes in drought events over YP (period 1961–2018) using the severity-area-duration method. The impact of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on seasonal droughts and their lag period were also quantified by employing the sliding correlation coefficient and cross-wavelet analysis method. New hydrological insights for the region 74 drought events were identified during 1961–2018 in YP, which were mainly short-duration that occurred in the 1980 s and 2000 s, and most drought centers are located over the northern and eastern parts of YP. We found that a significant correlation and different lag periods exist between Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) and seasonal precipitation in YP. Spring droughts mainly occurred in El Niño years during the 1980 s and the 1990 s, whilst winter droughts mainly occurred in La Niña years during the 1990 s and the 2000 s with a lag period of up to 12 months.",

      "abstract": "The analysis of the hydrological response to meteorological drought events can lead to a deeper understanding of alterations in hydrological processes that can be used to help maintain environmental flow (e‐flow) in aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we first identified an extreme meteorological drought event and then assessed its hydrological response. Monthly precipitation anomalies were used to identify meteorological drought, while the Lyne–Hollick method (LH filter) was used alongside the baseflow recession constant (calculated using the Automatic Baseflow Identification Technique [ABIT]) to isolate baseflow in the Baiyangdian basin. Results showed that an extreme meteorological drought event occurred in August 1996, continuing for a total of 127 months, which resulted in prolonged hydrological drought (i.e., streamflow and baseflow). A time lag was generally observed between the end of the meteorological drought event and the end of the hydrological drought event, where baseflow recovery lagged behind streamflow (runoff) recovery. Additionally, drought led to an unstable shift in the precipitation‐streamflow relationship that subsequently led to a reduction in the annual streamflow of coinciding annual precipitation compared with the historical relationship. Drought also led to a longer response between precipitation and runoff events. Results from this study show that the hydrological response to meteorological drought event is important for water resource management and for addressing effects related to climate change, especially extreme drought events.",

The spatial extent of CSDHW is asymmetrically enlarging, with a significant increase in Eurasia and a relatively high fluctuation in North America. Specifically, the warm‐type CSDHW (i.e., snow drought with normal or above‐average precipitation followed by heatwave) occurs more frequently, with spatial coverage increasing faster than the dry‐type CSDHW (i.e., snow drought with below‐average precipitation followed by heatwave). In comparison, dry snow drought is more likely to be followed by heatwave due to intensified soil drought and atmospheric aridity.",

      "abstract": "Hydrological drought is a highly complex and extreme natural disaster, which has increased in deficit, areal extent, and frequency with the penetration of climate change impact. For better anticipating hydrological droughts, it is crucial to evaluate hydrological drought and its teleconnections with large-scale climate indices (LSCI) effectively. This study estimated the dynamics and patterns of hydrological drought in the near-real river networks by virtue of the standardized runoff index (SRI) based on VIC and large-scale routing model in the Xijiang River basin, and revealed their teleconnections with the climate indices. Results show that model simulation can reasonably reveal the hydrological drought evolutions in near-real river networks and effectively expose the drought downward spread along main channels. The drought spread distances in Hongshuihe and Yujiang Rivers are farther under the comprehensive influence of climate, topography, and watershed shape. Hydrological drought evolutions in the upper reaches are mainly manifested as three patterns, including S12 (simultaneous significant changes in drought intensity, concentration degree, and frequency), S7(simultaneous significant changes in drought intensity and frequency), and S1(single significant change in drought intensity). These drought dynamic patterns are majority affected by climate variation patterns M1 (warm and cold AMO), M3 (cold PDO), and M7 (warm AMO/AO). For decision-makers, this work is beneficial for understanding and anticipating hydrological droughts in the river networks, and further selecting management strategies for water resources.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 8,
      "abstract": "The lack of in-situ hydrological observations, especially in remote and developing areas, is one of the main challenges of drought monitoring. This paper proposes a novel drought index, the Standardized River Stage Index (SRSI), based on data retrieved from satellite altimetry missions. The novelties of the SRSI are that it can quantitatively monitor drought of river water deficits at multiple timescales and that it does not require in-situ observations. The Mekong River is used as the case study to demonstrate and validate the SRSI calculated from the multi-mission satellite altimetry data (Envisat and Jason-2/3). The log-logistic distribution is best fitted for SRSI calculation for the highest goodness-of-fit for river stages for the Mekong River. The comparison with the Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) from the in-situ discharge observations shows that the SRSI can reasonably capture the drought of river water deficit. It is effective in identifying the timing and intensity of severe drought events, such as the 2019 Thailand drought. The SRSI is also compared with the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index and the GRACE Drought Index in revealing drought features such that the river water deficit of Mekong River has time lags of 2 to 3 months for precipitation deficits and water storage deficits. Hence, the SRSI is more suitable for monitoring drought of river water deficit, because it directly links to the streamflow via physical stage-discharge relationship. Overall, the SRSI provides an effective indicator of drought of river water deficit when in-situ observations are unavailable. It can serve in the real-time drought early warning in remote and developing areas.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",

      "abstract": "Understanding hydrological variability is of crucial importance for water resource management in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). While existing studies typically focus on individual river basins, and suffer from incomplete records, this study provides a new perspective of trends and variability in hydrological flood and drought characteristics (frequency, duration, and intensity) across the entire SSA. This is achieved by: i) creating a 65-year long, complete daily streamflow dataset consisting of over 600 gauging stations; ii) quantifying changes in flood and drought characteristics between 1950 and 2014; iii) evaluating how decadal variability influences historical trends. Results of daily streamflow reconstructions using random forests provide satisfactory performance over most of SSA, except for parts of southern Africa. Using change-point and trend analyses, we identify-three periods that characterise historical variations affecting hydrological extremes in western and central Africa, and some parts of southern Africa: i) the 1950s–60s and after the 1980s–90s, when floods (droughts) tend to be more (less) intense, more (less) frequent and more (less) persistent; and ii) the 1970s–80s, when floods (droughts) are less (more) intense, less (more) frequent and less (more) persistent. Finally, we reveal significant decadal variations in all flood and drought characteristics, which explain aperiodic increasing and decreasing trends. This stresses the importance of considering multiple time-periods when analysing recent trends, as previous assessments may have been unrepresentative of long-term changes.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 22,
      "abstract": "The Effective Drought Index (EDI) is designed to monitor and characterize the drought condition at a daily scale, using the last 30 years of daily precipitation records as a climatic yardstick. A critique of the EDI is that the behavior of the index depends on the reference period, making comparisons of EDI values difficult over a long record period. Here, a self-calibrating EDI (scEDI) is calculated using the 244-year daily precipitation records (1777–2020) in Seoul, the Republic of Korea. The scEDI is evaluated by comparing with drought damage reports from the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty (1807–1907) and relevant online search activity volumes from Google Trends and NAVER DataLab data (2013–20). The scEDI automatically calibrates the behavior of the index over time by calculating the normal condition of antecedent precipitation based on a rolling 30-year period. As a result, the scEDI is more temporally comparable than the EDI, that is, droughts with the same intensity have the same frequency throughout the entire record period, regardless of wet and dry decades. Results show that a majority of drought damage records and spikes of public interest in droughts are found when droughts are moderate (-1.4 of scEDI) and severe (-2.0), respectively, implying that social drought impacts/response might occur during different intensities of an emerging drought. This study highlights the importance of temporally self-calibration when it comes to detecting and characterizing “social droughts” with social impact/response data over multi-centuries.",

      "abstract": "In a human-dominated world, access to sustainable water resources has led to complex management policies that affect hydrological droughts. Applying the best approach to assess the contribution of these human-made changes to hydrological droughts is still underexplored. In this study, the individual and joint impacts of dam and inter-basin water transfer projects are quantified for the characteristic changes of hydrological drought using a developed data-based framework and were tested in a semi-arid, data-scarce basin in central Iran. The proposed data-based framework combines the upstream–downstream comparison method and the individual–station–drought analysis. This framework could properly assess the individual and joint contributions of dam and water transfer projections to making aggravations or alleviations in hydrological drought. It identified the dam and joint impacts of the dam with water transfer by 66 and 55%, respectively, as the most effective human intervention to alleviate the duration of hydrological drought. The proposed framework gives the flexibility to form different comparative analyses by using different types of flow data to assess the impacts of human interventions. This framework is also applicable in other regions to quantify the contributions of point-based human interventions to hydrological droughts. The comprehensive knowledge of solutions to alleviate the adverse impacts of droughts can reduce the damage in water-stressed regions.",

      "abstract": "Agricultural and ecological developments are increasingly paid attention in light of climate change. It is expected to comprehensively macroscopically control agricultural and ecological developments in shallow groundwater area that ecology is closely related to agricultural development. This study synthesizes multi models, including process-based crop growth model, water status model of shelterbelt, and vegetation-soil-groundwater interactions to identify responses of crops, shelterbelt, and natural vegetation to different level droughts. Obtained results show that the rank of vulnerabilities to droughts is: maize (the most vulnerable crop) > wheat > sunflower > shelterbelt (the least vulnerable vegetation). Under three drought scenarios, the natural vegetation biomass is all in stable states that fluctuations of groundwater salinity and precipitation cannot largely change the natural vegetation biomass. The natural vegetation biomass in equilibrium states is decreased by 4.08 % and 9.19 % respectively when available irrigation water is reduced to 70 % and 50 % levels. The results indicate that controlling and decreasing initial soil salt content before crop growth may be an effective way to avoid the decrease in the yield loss caused by salinization. It is suggested that vulnerable crops and the possible evolution of natural vegetation towards degradation in extreme droughts should be concerned and taken certain measures. This study also implies that optimizing planting structure is a possible strategy to improve adaptabilities to droughts and decrease economic losses. The established model contributes to provide an effective approach to handle large-scale decision-making problems about comprehensively developing agriculture and ecology in changing environments.

      "title": "How standard are standardized drought indices? Uncertainty components for the SPI & SPEI case",
      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 74,
      "abstract": "Standardized drought indices such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) or the Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) are frequently used around the world to assess drought severity across a continent or a larger region covering different meteorological regimes. But how standard are these standardized indices? In this paper we quantify the uncertainty of SPI and SPEI based on an Austrian dataset to shed light on what are the main sources of uncertainty in the study area. Five factors that either defy the control of the analyst (record length, observation period), or need to be subjectively decided during the steps of the calculation (choice of the distribution, parameter estimation method, and GOF-test of the fitted distribution) are considered. We use the root mean squared error () for estimating the typical error for different calculation algorithm of SPI and SPEI. The total and relative uncertainty components for each factor are analysed by a linear mixed model (LMM) and significance of each model parameter are tested by the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the restricted likelihood ratio test. The indicates that computational variations of standardized drought indices lead to highly variable results. From the LMM, the choice of the distribution and the observational window are the most important sources of uncertainty. They, on average, control between 19% and 63% (choice of distribution) and 24% to 70% (observation period) of the total variance of the SPI across all stations and month of the year, with similar values observed for the SPEI. The parameter estimation method and the GOF-tests, however, have almost no effect on the standardized indices. Total errors and observation period uncertainty are typically decreasing with the record length as one would expect, while the distribution uncertainty is almost independent from the record length. An additional assessment shows that the uncertainties are similar at the pan-European scale leading to uncertain characterizations of major events such as the drought of 2015. Overall, the uncertainty of standardized drought indices is substantial. Alternative approaches as nonparametric methods, ensemble approaches or probability-based indices based on established methods of extreme-value statistics should be considered, to make the indices more accurate.",

Since drought monitoring is an important issue, it is imperative to develop more user-friendly, modern methods for it. The present study investigates the uncertainty of the difference between monthly mean precipitation and potential evapotranspiration utilizing Shannon’s entropy over short-, mid-, and long-term dynamic time scales in the Karkheh Basin of Iran. An entropy-based precipitation–evapotranspiration index (EPEI) is defined for drought classification. EPEI is compared with the standardized precipitation–evapotranspiration index (SPEI) in terms of spatiotemporal patterns. The results indicate a higher similarity between EPEI and SPEI under existing conditions with low average precipitation. Over short scales, both indices yield similar results in duration, frequency, and intensity. Over long scales, the consistency of the drought duration, frequency, and intensity results declines. The main difference between the two is the EPEI’s ability to determine the early onset of the drought event.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Research",
      "citations": 32,
      "abstract": "Flash droughts are recently recognized subseasonal extreme climate phenomena, which develop with rapid onset and intensification and have significant socio‐environmental impacts. However, their historical trends and variability remain unclear largely due to the uncertainty associated with existing approaches. Here we comprehensively assessed trends, spatiotemporal variability, and drivers of soil moisture (SM) and evaporative demand (ED) flash droughts over the contiguous United States (CONUS) during 1981–2018 using hierarchical clustering, wavelet analysis, and bootstrapping conditional probability approaches. Results show that flash droughts occur in all regions in CONUS with Central and portions of the Eastern US showing the highest percentage of weeks in flash drought. ED flash drought trends are significantly increasing in all regions, while SM flash drought trends were relatively weaker across CONUS, with small significant increasing trends in the South and West regions and a decreasing trend in the Northeast. Rising ED flash drought trends are related to increasing temperature trends, while SM flash drought trends are strongly related to trends in weekly precipitation intensity besides weekly average precipitation and evapotranspiration. In terms of temporal variability, high severity flash droughts occurred every 2–7 years, corresponding with ENSO periods. For most CONUS regions, severe flash droughts occurred most often during La Niña and when the American Multidecadal Oscillation was in a positive phase. Pacific Decadal Oscillation negative phases and Artic Oscillation positive phases were also associated with increased flash drought occurrences in several regions. These findings may have implications for informing long‐term flash drought predictions and adaptations.",

      "journal": "International Journal of Climatology",
      "citations": 9,
      "abstract": "As a natural hazard, drought is a complex multivariate phenomenon that does not depend on only one hydrometeorological variable, as well as, considering a particular kind of drought may not be effective for drought management. Considering this, many multivariate drought indices have been developed based on linearity assumptions or conventional copulas assuming symmetric relationships among univariate drought indices. In this study, D-vine copula was applied to construct a four-dimensional index, named as Integrated Drought Index (IDI), by combining four univariate drought indices (Standardized Precipitation Index [SPI], Reconnaissance Drought Index [RDI], Standardized Soil moisture Index [SSI] and Standardized stream flow Drought Index [SDI]) to better reflect many hydrometeorological variables (precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture and stream flow) and different kinds of drought (meteorological, agricultural and hydrological) simultaneously. Vine copula was used to solve nonlinear and asymmetric relationships among drought indices due to its flexibility over the free selection of copula (s) in each step of hierarchical structure in high dimensional modelling. The IDI was constructed for 1-and 4-month timescales for the upper Tapti basin of the central region in India. The performance of IDI was tested with dependence measures (Pearson's correlation coefficient, Mutual Information) and evaluated against the Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly data derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. Spatial analysis of drought was carried out by fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm with IDI. IDI based on vine copula solved the nonlinear and asymmetric relationships among different variables associated with the occurrence of droughts effectively with a reduction of uncertainty as compared to the single drought indices for different kinds of droughts. Analysis revealed spatially different drought risks in the upper and lower river basins. In general, the vine copula addresses nonlinear and asymmetric relationships that exist between the variables associated with natural hazards like drought.",

      "citations": 22,
      "abstract": "Although various studies have investigated the impacts of climate variability and human activities on drought, researches specifically analysing the impact on ecological drought are still limited. A deep understanding of the climatic and anthropogenic effects on ecological drought processes is crucial for ecological regulation and management in the changing environments. In the present study, an integrated approach for comprehensive understanding and quantification of ecological drought in rivers was proposed which first applied the nonparametric kernel density estimation (KDE) method to calculate the most suitable ecological streamflow (MSES) for a river ecosystem. Then, the variable threshold level method based on the MSES for each month and the run theory method were applied to identify the ecological drought duration and deficit volumes. Finally, a quantification approach based on hydrological model simulation was proposed to attribute the impacts of climate variability and human activities on ecological drought. The proposed approach was applied on two catchments, Xianyang (XY) and Huaxian (HX) within the Weihe River Basin (WRB) in northern China. Comparison results obtained using the two empirical methods revealed that the MSES calculated using the KDE method was reasonable and can be used for ecological drought identification. The identification results showed that both the median and upper quartile values of the drought duration and deficit volumes during the disturbed period (1991–2017) were greater than those during the undisturbed period (1961–1990). Quantification results showed that human activities were the dominant factor aggravating ecological drought in the WRB after 1990. The contribution rates of climate variability and human activities toward ecological drought variations were 25.6% and 74.4%, respectively, for the XY station and 42.7% and 57.3%, respectively, for the HX station. Although the WRB was selected as a case study, the proposed approach can also be applied to other regions to provide scientific guidance for regional ecological management.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrometeorology",
      "citations": 7,
      "abstract": "Multiple indicators derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite have been used in monitoring floods and droughts. However, these measures are constrained by the relatively short time span (∼20 years) and coarse temporal resolution (1 month) of the GRACE and GRACE Follow-On missions, and the inherent decay mechanism of the land surface system has not been considered. Here we reconstructed the daily GRACE-like terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) in the Yangtze River basin (YRB) during 1961–2015 based on the Institute of Geodesy at Graz University of Technology (ITSG)-Grace2018 solution using the random forest (RF) model. A novel antecedent metric, namely, standardized drought and flood potential index (SDFPI), was developed using reconstructed TWSA, observed precipitation, and modeled evapotranspiration. The potential of SDFPI was evaluated against in situ discharge, VIC simulations, and several widely used indices such as total storage deficit index (TSDI), self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (sc-PDSI), and multiscale standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). Daily SDFPI was utilized to monitor and characterize short-term severe floods and droughts. The results illustrate a reasonably good accuracy of ITSG-Grace2018 solution when compared with the hydrological model output and regional water balance estimates. The RF model presents satisfactory performances for the TWSA reconstruction, with a correlation coefficient of 0.88 and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.76 during the test period 2011–15. Spatiotemporal propagation of the developed SDFPI corresponds well with multiple indices when examined for two typical short-term events, including the 2003 flood and 2013 drought. A total of 22 submonthly exceptional floods and droughts were successfully detected and featured using SDFPI, highlighting its outperformance and capabilities in providing inferences for decision-makers and stakeholders to monitor and mitigate the short-term floods and droughts.",

      "abstract": "As a result of global warming, compound extreme events become more frequent across the world. Compound drought and hot events (CDHEs) are receiving increasing attention because their social and environmental impacts are greater than those of individual extreme events. This study uses the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and maximum temperature, to define CDHEs based on the two-dimensional definition on the daily scale, in eastern China during the warm season (May - October) from 1961 to 2018, identify hot spot areas of CDHEs, and explore the multiple characteristics and variations of CDHEs. The main results are as follows: North China (NC) and Southwest China (SWC) were selected as hot spot areas due to their high-frequency of compound days and the increasing trend in the number of days and land area ratio affected by compound days. CDHEs have become more frequent, long-lasting and extreme in eastern China, especially in NC. Although the change in SWC is not as great as that in NC, the proportion of extreme events in all the severities and the proportion of long duration events in all the durations are larger in SWC than in the other regions. The probability distribution of occurrence date was unimodal in the entire eastern China and it was similar in NC. Whereas, the probability distribution was bimodal in SWC. The occurrence dates of CDHEs with different severities and durations postponed in 1991–2018 compared to 1961–1990, and this feature was the most pronounced in SWC. This study contributes to raising awareness of CDHEs and informs the mitigation of their adverse effects.",

      "abstract": "Concurrent heatwaves and droughts that occur over northeastern China (NEC) bring severe threats to human lives and crop production. Despite the great efforts taken in previous studies, realistic prediction of these concurrent extreme events remains a challenge. In the present study, a probability-based index that simultaneously considers precipitation deficiency and high temperature is calculated to represent concurrent heatwaves and droughts in July–August over NEC. Based on this index, the characteristics of concurrent heatwaves and droughts over NEC in July–August are investigated using the year-to-year increment approach. The results indicate that the occurrence of concurrent heatwaves and droughts over NEC is closely related to the Polar-Eurasian teleconnection pattern and the Pacific-Japan teleconnection pattern. Further analyses indicate that the sea ice content in the Barents Sea in March ( SICBS ), the La Niña-like sea surface temperature (SST) in February ( SST-PC1 ), and the northwestern Siberia soil moisture in April ( SM ) are coincidently linked to the two teleconnection patterns mentioned above. Based on their corresponding physical mechanisms, these three independent predictors are chosen to construct a physical-empirical prediction model for the prediction of concurrent heatwaves and droughts over NEC. Results suggest that this physical-empirical prediction model performs well with a high correlation coefficient and a low root mean squared error between the observed and predicted concurrent heatwaves and droughts over NEC during the period of 1979–2018. Moreover, the cross-validation test and independent hindcasts both suggest that the physical-empirical model proposed in the present study with the three independent predictors has good prediction skills.",

Thus, the traditional standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was revisited by drought index (DI) using satellite soil moisture data and land surface evapotranspiration from Penman-Monteith-Leuning Version 2 (PML_V2) datasets to assess the dryness over 2417 station’s grid points in China. DI was compared with the self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index (scPDSI), SPEI and composite drought index (CDI) for three major land cover classes (croplands, grasslands, and forests) area. The independent evaluation was carried out using sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (vegetation photosynthesis), and normalized difference vegetation index datasets including crop yield. Results exhibited that DI performance was comparable with CDI than scPDSI and SPEI to capture the impact of drought on vegetation photosynthesis. Vegetation productivity assessed by NDVI was significantly affected by dryness in the northern and southern part of China using DI, CDI and scPDSI and compared to SPEI. DI displayed a positive correlation with wheat, maize, and rice yield. Revisited drought index showed significant results for vegetation productivity but still necessitate future work to improve DI for agricultural drought research.",

      "abstract": "Drought is a recurring natural hazard that has substantial human and environmental impacts. Given continued global warming and associated climate change, there is concern that droughts could become more severe and longer lasting. To better monitor and understand drought development and persistence, it is helpful to understand the development and climatic drivers of past droughts. In this study we use monthly runoff percentiles to identify five major drought events in the conterminous United States (CONUS) from 1901 through 2020. For each drought event we examined spatial patterns of departures of mean monthly precipitation, temperature, soil moisture storage, and runoff for 2,107 hydrologic units (HUs) across the CONUS. Results indicated that precipitation deficits have been the primary driver of past major-drought events and temperature a secondary driver, even of the most recent drought event (September 1999 through September 2015) when positive temperature anomalies occurred over most of the CONUS. Additionally, negative soil moisture storage departures were more negative than runoff departures during the five drought events we examined, which emphasizes the importance of measuring both runoff and soil moisture to monitor drought conditions. We also examined the use of statistical persistence to develop short-term (ie, 1 month) forecasts of runoff drought conditions in the CONUS by developing autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models for each HU. Results indicated that persistence can be used to predict short-term changes in the spatial pattern of drought and the areal extent of drought, but that predictions of runoff magnitude for any particular site are often poor.",

      "abstract": "Flash drought (FD) is characterized by the rapid onset and development of drought conditions. It usually occurs during the growing seasons, causing more severe impacts on agriculture and society than the slowly evolving droughts. Based on the Standardized Evaporative Stress Ratio ( SESR ), this study presents an assessment of the spatiotemporal variability of the joint return periods of FD characteristics in the Pearl River basin (PRB), southern China. Three FD characteristics (i.e., duration D , intensity I , peak P ) are extracted at each 0.25° × 0.25° grid point over the PRB by the Runs theory. Four marginal distribution functions (gamma, exponential, generalized extreme value, and lognormal) are used to fit FD characteristics, while three Archimedean copula functions (Clayton, Frank, and Gumbel) are used for generating the joint distributions of various paired FD characteristics. The results indicate that lognormal is the best-fitted marginal distribution function of FD characteristics in most parts of PRB, while Frank and Clayton are the best-fitted copula of the joint distributions of three pairs of FD characteristics in most parts of PRB. During 1953–2013, the FD events are more frequent in eastern PRB (> 40 events) than western PRB (< 10 events), and larger FD characteristics ( D and I ) are also found in eastern PRB than western PRB. The return period of each FD characteristic is smaller in eastern PRB than western PRB, leading to smaller joint return periods of three paired FD characteristics ( D-I , D-P , P-I ) in eastern PRB than western PRB. Overall, our results suggest that the risk of FD is gradually increased from the west to the east of the PRB.",

      "abstract": "Socioeconomic drought can directly affect human survival and economic development, however, existing literature lacks information related to the formation and development of socioeconomic drought and mainly deals with drought index and its properties. We used Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase-6 (CMIP6), System Dynamics (SD) method and Soil and Water Assessment Tools (SWAT) to calculate the Standardized Water Supply and Demand Index (SWSDI). The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was applied to identify the driving factors of socioeconomic drought in Dongjiang basin, and predict its future properties. Then, propagation and the time from meteorological and hydrological to socioeconomic drought were predicted. The duration and intensity of socioeconomic drought events were lower in the wet season than in the dry season, and those having higher severity were more discrete. Among different factors, precipitation exerted more pronounced impacts than radiation forcing. Similarly, positive correlations between total vegetated percentage cover, rural per capita income, and radiation forcing were observed to be affecting the socioeconomic drought, whereas leaf area index was negatively correlated. Seasonal variations significantly affected the propagation time, where the time for the wet season was less than for the dry season. Moreover, intensive radiative forcing would momentarily shorten the optimal propagation time in the wet season and extend it in the dry season. Results of this study provide a theoretical basis for understanding the causes, mechanisms, and factors responsible for socioeconomic drought and also provides insights on its transmission mechanism.",

      "abstract": "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted that droughts are projected to affect global hydrology and water quality in varying ways, resulting in a considerable challenge to water availability for society, environment, and ecosystems. This study employed the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to evaluate how drought affects hydrology and water quality in the Miyun Reservoir watershed, coupled with bias-corrected climate projections in the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario, accommodating the intercoupling effects of precipitation shifts and rising temperatures. The standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized runoff index (SRI), and standardized soil moisture index (SSWI) were used to characterize meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural droughts that occur in the different phases in the hydrological cycle. Climate change had the most significant impact on agricultural drought. SSWI were projected to considerably increase in intensity, frequency, and duration in most subbasins by up to 15 %, 55 %, and 45 %, respectively, and showed a strong correlation with meteorological and hydrological droughts (correlation coefficients r = 0.54, 0.57, and 0.60 with SPI for the baseline, near future and far future periods, and 0.91, 0.87, and 0.89 with SRI for the three periods, respectively). Hydrological components, sediment export, and nutrient loss were highly correlated with changes in drought indexes, with r ranging between −0.68 and 0.34 in the near future period and −0.62 and 0.53 in the far future period. Drought conditions of surface runoff and soil water dominated the changes in sediment export, and hydrological drought was the major cause for reduced nutrient loads. In addition to drought impacts, the synergistic effects of increasing precipitation and rising temperature led to a certain degree of increase in sediment and nutrient exports. The results of this study emphasize the need to enhance the resilience of watershed systems to the predicted increases in the intensity, frequency, and duration of droughts.",

      "citations": 12,
      "abstract": "Catchment-scale efficient agricultural drought monitoring and irrigation planning mostly depend on the accuracy of evapotranspiration (ET) estimates under different crop-growth phases. As indirect ET estimation under limited data availability scenario and complex paddy-field dynamics could not be sufficiently addressed by the conventional curve number (CN) based SWAT model, SWAT incorporates an add-in pothole module (SWAT-P) that conceptualizes the paddy-field hydrology with the empirical coefficient or equations resulting in poor ET estimates. To address these limitations, this study integrates an improved pothole methodology in SWAT (SWAT-EP) accounting the vadose-zone soil water dynamics under alternate ponding and drying conditions, ET variation under moisture abundant and stress conditions, and role of irrigation return flow generated in the paddy fields. The proposed approach was validated in the Kangsabati River integrated reservoir-catchment-command (12,014.70 km 2 ) of the eastern India, and the results reveal that SWAT-EP outperformed the existing SWAT-P in reproducing the catchment-scale streamflow and ET flux with respect to the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (PM) based ET estimates in all the four cropping seasons. The SWAT-EP derived Standardized Evapotranspiration Drought Index (SEDI) based drought severity and duration well-corroborate with the benchmark MOD16A2 derived drought estimates; whereas, the SWAT-P tends to overestimate the drought severity in the command area. The predictive uncertainty in drought monitoring was the lowest by SWAT-EP with relatively lower uncertainty was observed in the crop-growing locations of Kharagpur and Mohanpur. Moreover, the teleconnection between drought and climatic escalations corresponds to a better reproducibility of El Niño and La Niña phases by the SWAT-EP, while the SWAT-P performed un-satisfactorily across different spatiotemporal domains. This study endorses to adopt the proposed SWAT-EP model for river basin-scale drought monitoring and irrigation planning with prior validation in the diversified climatic and topographic conditions.",

      "abstract": "Agriculture is one of the sectors most directly and severely affected by droughts. Therefore, information regarding the water required (WR) to recover from agricultural drought and the probability of agricultural drought recovery under different precipitation scenarios is of great importance for drought risk management. In this study, we developed a quantitative evaluation method to estimate the WR of agricultural drought event recovery and a probabilistic drought recovery framework based on the copula function to calculate the probabilities of recovery from different grades of agricultural drought under given precipitation scenarios. The developed method and framework were demonstrated in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) using the improved soil moisture anomaly percentage index (ISMAPI). The average duration of agricultural drought recovery in the YRB was 28 d. The difference in soil moisture persistence was the main factor affecting the spatial pattern of the grid mean drought recovery characteristics. For individual drought events, precipitation was the most important factor affecting drought recovery, followed by drought development intensity. There is a clear nonlinear relationship between the P CP value (percentage of cumulative precipitation during drought recovery to its corresponding climatological mean) and the drought recovery duration. In most grids, the three-parameter power function can be used to characterize this relationship and further estimate the WR to recover from an agricultural drought event under different expected recovery durations. We estimated the probabilities of extreme and severe agricultural drought recovery under different precipitation scenarios when the expected recovery durations were 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 d based on the developed probabilistic drought recovery framework. For example, when the cumulative precipitation is no less than its climatological mean within 30 d, the probability of recovering from extreme agricultural drought is 0.59. These findings are important for decision-making in water and drought management.",

      "abstract": "Hydrological and meteorological droughts are complex hazards that cover a wide spatiotemporal spectrum and can affect the economic, environmental, and social sectors. However, it is challenging to characterize hydrometeorological drought and its propagation from precipitation deficits to soil moisture, discharge, and groundwater deficits and to ascertain to what extent catchment characteristics may affect drought features. This research explores the link between hydrometeorological drought characteristics and catchment characteristics. It investigates their propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought conditions in nine selected catchments from the Awash basin in Ethiopia using standardized indices of precipitation (SPI), soil moisture deficits (SPEI), streamflow (SRI), and base flow (SBI). The study results indicate that the propagation of meteorological to agricultural and hydrological droughts increases with increasing aggregation time scale and has a proportionally higher probability of propagation for moderate, severe, and extreme droughts. Across all catchments, the average lag time between hydrological and meteorological drought magnitude occurrence is 4–6 months, with lag times likely to increase by 7–8 months at a higher aggregation time scale. Meteorological drought has a 0.5 higher probability of occurrence than hydrological drought in a given period. In contrast, it has a lower (0.3) probability of the surface deficit becoming a groundwater deficit. At a 3-month cumulative time scale, the probability of propagating meteorological drought using the SPI to hydrological drought using the SRI is higher than that of propagating hydrological drought using the SBI. Therefore, the results suggest that while the propagation of meteorological droughts (SPI and SPEI) to hydrological droughts (SRI and SBI) slightly increases with aggregation time, the time taken for precipitation to become apparent in hydrological variables increases. The results confirmed that the probability of meteorological drought leading to hydrological drought progression is critical and needs to be considered in water resource management and planning.",

This study investigated hydrometeorological drought in the Upper Mzingwane sub-catchment using the standardised precipitation index (SPI) and reconnaissance drought index (RDI). Precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature data from three stations in the sub-catchment were used to calculate RDI and SPI for the period 1990-2020. Two-tailed Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests were conducted to identify trends and breaks in the RDI and SPI values. The results showed that the sub-catchment was mainly affected by mild (62%) and moderate (20%) droughts. Significant increasing trends were observed for the calculated 6- and 12-month SPI and RDI values (p < 0.05), indicating a decreasing trend in long-term hydrological droughts. No trend was observed for the 3- and 6-month SPI and RDI values (p > 0.05). The Pettitt test did not detect any breaks in the RDI and SPI values. SPI and RDI showed strong correlation coefficients (0.93-0.99) over similar time periods. Thus, both indices behaved in the same manner across multiple time intervals (3, 6, 9 and 12 months), but RDI was more sensitive to climatic conditions because its formulation incorporates potential evapotranspiration. Approximately 14-16 droughts of varying severity occurred in the sub-catchment from 1990 to 2020. Despite increasing precipitation pattern, the catchment was still vulnerable to drought and this could undermine the ability of the catchment to deliver requisite ecosystem services such as water provision. Thus, drought forecasting, and information dissemination will be crucial to help stakeholders better prepare for future droughts in the sub-catchment.",

      "abstract": "Drought is an extreme climatic event that mostly occurs as a result of low rainfall, which leads to lack of water in various agro-ecological conditions of Pakistan. The condition could be further exacerbated by the prevailing dry weather. Therefore, accurate, timely, and efficient drought monitoring is crucial to ensure that its adverse effects are mitigated. In this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and TRMM-based data were used together with remote sensing techniques to improve drought mitigation and disaster risk reduction strategies. In order to monitor drought mitigation and disaster risk reduction strategies in Pakistan, the crop water stress index (CWSI), vegetation condition index (VCI), normalized vegetation supply water index (NVSWI), vegetation health index (VHI), and temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI) were chosen as the instrument. Due to low rainfall and significantly low vegetation, CWSI, NDVI, TVDI, and VHI are useful in characterizing drought mitigation strategies in Pakistan. Monthly NDVI, NAP, NVSWI, TVDI, VCI, and VHI values and heat map analysis show that Pakistan suffered from drought in years 2001, 2002, and 2006. Seasonal CWSI, NDVI, VHI, and TVDI confirmed that Pakistan was affected by severe drought in 2001, which continued and led to severe drought in 2002 and 2006. We generate spatial correlation coefficients between NDVI and NVSWI, VCI, and VHI, and NVSWI and VCI and VHI, while the VCI and VHI values are significantly positively correlated. CWSI, NDVI, VHI, and TVDI show positive signs of effective climate change drought mitigation and disaster risk reduction strategies in Pakistan. Thus, these drought indices have been confirmed to be a complete drought monitoring indicator and reduce the risk of drought in Pakistan.",

      "abstract": "Study region Zhanjiang City District, southwest of Guangdong Province, China, was selected as the case study area owing to its relatively frequent occurrence of droughts and groundwater overexploitation. Study focus This study presents a useful framework to characterize the propagation from meteorological drought (MD) to groundwater drought (GD) in different aquifers from the perspective of multiple timescales. Two standardized drought indices, i.e., standardized groundwater index and standardized precipitation index with different timescales (1–48 months), were used to examine the propagation time from MD to GD in different aquifers. Three clusters, i.e., natural(P)-, natural+human(P + H)-, and human(H)-induced drought, were considered for revealing the potential driving mechanism of propagation. Four characteristic mechanisms of lag, pooling, lengthening, and attenuation were used to analyze the propagation process from MD to GD, among which the lag characteristic, showing the propagation time, was discussed corresponding to varied clusters. New hydrological insights for the region Results indicate the following: (1) The propagation time in different aquifers varied; that is, in the shallow aquifer, the average propagation time showed 1 month for the P cluster and 3 months for the P + H cluster, while the propagation time in the middle and deep aquifers were found to be longer than that in the shallow layer though much uncertainty remained for the former. (2) The influences from MD obtained the decreasing order of P > P + H>H. The propagation time of the P + H cluster was longer than that of the P cluster, suggesting the negative influence of human activities. This study can provide additional information for policymakers involved in groundwater management during a drought.",

The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is chosen as a case study to test the CRSDI and investigate drought changes and their impacts on vegetation. The results show that CRSDI can effectively monitor the propagation processes and characteristics of meteorological and agroecological droughts. Drought conditions on the QTP are overall relieved from 2000 to 2020, while these changes show an apparent spatial variability, with a general drying (wetting) trend in the north (south). Moreover, vegetation response to drought is different among different vegetation types, with shrubland having a stronger response, followed by cropland, grassland, and forestland. Clearly, CRSDI is valuable for large-scale drought monitoring and assessment.",

      "citations": 6,
      "abstract": "Drought events have been reported in all Brazilian regions every year, evolving slowly over time and large areas, and largely impacting agriculture, hydropower production, and water supplies. In the last two decades, major drought events have occurred over the country, such as the 2010 and 2015 events in the Amazon, the 2012 event in the Pampa, and the 2014 event in the Cerrado biome. This research aimed to understand drought propagation and patterns over these biomes through joint analysis of hydrological, climatic, and vegetation indices based on remote sensing data. To understand the drought cascade propagation patterns, we assessed precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture (at surface and sub-surface), terrestrial water storage, land surface temperature, enhanced vegetation index, and gross primary productivity. Similar drought patterns were observed in the 2015 Amazon and 2012 Pampa droughts, with meteorological and agricultural droughts followed by a hydrological drought, while the 2014 event in the Cerrado was more associated with a hydrological drought. Moreover, the 2015 Amazon drought showed a different pattern than that of 2010, with higher anomalies in precipitation and lower anomalies in evapotranspiration. Thus, drought propagation behaves differently in distinct Brazilian biomes. Our results highlight that terrestrial water storage anomalies were able to represent the hydrological drought patterns over the country. Our findings reveal important aspects of drought propagation using remote sensing in a heterogenous country largely affected by such events.",

      "abstract": "Streamflow droughts are governed by different hydro‐meteorological processes, whose relative importance may change over time, with potential impacts on drought severity. Here, we assess changes in the importance of different hydrological drought generation processes in the European Alps by applying a standardized drought type classification scheme to two time periods—one in the distant (1970–1993) and one in the recent past (1994–2017). Our findings show that changes in the relative importance of different drought generation processes are stronger in high‐elevation catchments, where we detect clear changes in drought seasonality, than in low‐elevation catchments. Furthermore, they suggest that changes in drought severity and generation processes are related because increasingly frequent snowmelt‐deficit droughts in high‐elevation catchments have larger deficits than droughts caused by decreasingly frequent cold temperatures. These changes might persist into the future, because of continuing decreases in snow cover and increases in evapotranspiration, with potential implications for water management.",

      "journal": "JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association",
      "citations": 19,
      "abstract": "In the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB), there is a deep reliance on seasonal snowpack for maintenance of water resources. The term “snow drought” has recently emerged to describe periods of anomalously low snowpack. Unique seasonal patterns in precipitation and temperature that drive snow drought can have distinct hydrologic signatures, and these relationships have not been carefully studied in the UCRB. Here we examine snow drought with a new classification scheme using peak snow water equivalent (SWE) and the ratio of basin‐wide modeled peak SWE to accumulated (onset to peak) precipitation (SWE/ P ) that clusters snow drought years into three distinct groups—“warm,” “dry,” and “warm & dry”—that minimize within‐group variance. Over the period 1916–2018, we identify 14 warm years (P ̄ = 160 mm; SWE/P ̄ = 0.24), 24 dry years (P ̄ = 117 mm; SWE/P ̄ = 0.35), and 21 warm & dry years (P ̄ = 94 mm; SWE/P ̄ = 0.23). An elevation‐based analysis reveals two distinct patterns: warm snow droughts see severe SWE reductions primarily at lower (<2600 m) elevations (65% at lower elevations, 37% overall), whereas “dry” scenarios exhibit a consistent reduction across all elevations (39% overall). Using naturalized streamflow data, we also differentiate snow droughts by their earlier streamflow timing and decreased peakedness (warm: 7 days, 2%; dry: 7 days, 2%; warm & dry: 13 days, 5%). This research provides new insights into snow drought patterns relevant for regional water management.",

      "citations": 20,
      "abstract": "Connections between meteorological and hydrological droughts (CMHDs) have changed due to increasingly intensified human activities. Understanding such changes from an anthropogenic perspective is, therefore, of critical importance for drought monitoring, early warning, and adaptation. As the second-longest river system in China, the Yellow River basin (YRB) has been seriously impacted by humans and has a high risk of drought due to its dry climate, dense population and massive water demand. However, the effects of human activities on CMHDs in the YRB are still unclear. We thus used the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and the standardized streamflow index (SSI) to indicate meteorological drought (MD) and hydrological drought (HD), respectively, and analysed CMHDs with multiple indicators including trends, correlation, difference, and drought propagation characteristics. Our results highlighted the heterogeneity of CMHDs in terms of subregions and indicators and showed that this heterogeneity was impacted by humans by quantifying the effects of human activities (mainly referring to water abstraction and regulation) on CMHDs in each subregion. We found that 1) human activities aggravated the disconnections between MD and HD by sharpening the downward trend in the SSI and weakening the correlation (amplifying the difference) between the SPEI and SSI, and 2) human activities reduced the drought propagation rate from MD to HD, manifested by a decreased number of HD but a lengthening of the HD duration. In addition to the abovementioned effects that were consistent for most of the YRB, there were also some effects, for example, on HD intensity and drought propagation time, that differed among subregions, and these kinds of diverse responses of CMHDs might be related to the various human activities in terms of intensities, types, and regions. By analysing human effects on CMHDs, this study may be helpful in understanding drought and drought propagation in the Anthropocene, which is beneficial to watershed management.",

      "citations": 31,
      "abstract": "Propagation thresholds that trigger a transition between meteorological drought and hydrological drought are poorly understood, which hinders effective establishment of drought warning systems and prevention measures. Here, propagation thresholds were assessed by firstly identifying drought events during 1961–2016 in the Yellow River Basin, China, subsequently pooling, excluding, and matching them, and finally assessing their threshold conditions by using a combined Copula function and transition rate ( T r ) analysis. These results show that response time changed according to variations in drought duration and watershed characteristics. Importantly, response times increased according to the timescales over which they were studied; for example, the Wenjiachuan watershed recorded response times of 8, 10, 10, and 13 months when examined at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month timescales, respectively. Additionally, the severity and duration of meteorological and hydrological drought events both increased when events were combined rather than studied individually. These effects were also amplified for matched meteorological and hydrological droughts by factors of 1.67 (severity) and 1.45 (duration), respectively. Shorter response times were identified in the Linjiacun (LJC) and Zhangjiashan (ZJS) watersheds, and correlated with their relatively small T r values of 43 % and 47 %, respectively. Higher propagation thresholds for drought characteristics ( e.g. , 1.81 and 1.95 for drought severity in the LJC and ZJS watersheds, respectively) imply that shorter response times tended to have greater effects on hydrological drought events and lowered their T r , and vice versa . These results provide new insight into propagation thresholds used for water resource planning and management, and may help to mitigate the effects of future climate change.",

      "abstract": "Drought monitoring and forecasting systems are used in the United States (U.S.) to inform drought management decisions. Drought forecasting efforts have often been conducted and evaluated at coarse spatial resolutions (i.e., >10‐km), which miss key local drought information at higher resolutions. Addressing the importance of forecasting drought at high resolutions, this study develops statistical models to evaluate 1‐ to 3‐month lead time predictability of meteorological and agricultural summer drought across the western U.S. at a 4‐km resolution. Our high‐resolution drought predictions have statistically significant skill ( p ≤ 0.05) across 70%–100% of the western U.S., varying by evaluation metric and lead time. 1‐ to 3‐month lead time drought forecasts accurately represent monitored summer drought spatial patterns during major drought events, the interannual variability of drought area from 1982 to 2020 ( r = 0.84–0.93), and drought trends ( r = 0.94–0.97). 71% of western U.S summer drought area interannual variability can be explained by cold‐season (November–February) climate conditions alone allowing skillful 3‐month lead time predictions. Pre‐summer drought conditions (represented by drought indices) are the most important predictors for summer drought. Thus, the statistical models developed in this study heavily rely on the autocorrelation of chosen agricultural and meteorological drought indices which estimate land surface moisture memory. Indeed, prediction skill strongly correlates with persistence of drought conditions ( r ≥ 0.73). This study is intended to support future development of operational drought early warning systems that inform drought management.",

      "abstract": "Due to climate change, the frequencies of extreme meteorological events have increased around the world over the last few decades, which would significantly affect the growth of vegetation, especially in humid regions. However, few previous studies have investigated the effects of compound extreme meteorological events on the growth of vegetation, such as compound drought and heat events (CDHEs). In this research, we assessed the individual and interactive impacts of drought and heat events on the growth of vegetation using geographic detectors in the Poyang Lake Basin (PYLB), which is located in a typical humid zone in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLYR) of China. We found that the effect of heat events on the growth of vegetation was greater than that of drought events in this region. Among the various vegetation types, shrubland (SL) and cultivated vegetation (CV) were most significantly affected by drought and heat events, respectively, and broadleaf forest (BLF) was more tolerant of drought (heat) events than other vegetation. Drought events had significantly negative effects on the growth of vegetation, and needle-leaf (NLF) and BLF exhibited a two-month lagged response. The impact of CDHE on the growth of vegetation was remarkably stronger than that of a single event, and the interaction type was bi-factor enhanced or nonlinear enhanced. Our findings highlight the need to consider CDHEs when assessing the response of vegetation to climate extremes under global warming.",

The standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), widely used around the globe, are employed here to increase our understanding of the drought indices, spatiotemporal characteristics, and factors related to agricultural droughts in western China; this is important for water resource management and drought forecasting in the region. Results show that both the SPEI and SPI can monitor typical agricultural droughts, but some differences appear against a background of climate change. The SPEI can generally accurately reflect variations in soil moisture in humid regions, while the SPI shows a better performance in other climate zones. Three spatially well-defined sub-regions with different temporal evolutions of droughts were identified to explain the main dry/wet variations across western China. Large-scale circulation patterns, daily extreme precipitation, daytime heatwaves, and geographic factors were found to have a potential connection with droughts.",

      "abstract": "Under warm climates, the more complex and malleable relationship between water and heat and the changes in the water components at the land–atmosphere interface pose greater challenges to understanding hydro-meteorological processes. However, the emergence of the advanced microwave scanning radiometer (AMSR) has facilitated the precise monitoring of these changes. Therefore, this study investigated and analyzed the spatiotemporal transformation characteristics of drought–wetness and its driving mechanisms in Central Asia from July 2002 to December 2018 based on the AMSR surface wetness index (ASWI) coupled with multiple water components. Three major conclusions were drawn from this investigation. First, the spatiotemporal differences in multiple water components in Central Asia caused substantial spatiotemporal differences in the extent of changes in drought–wetness. For example, arid areas were mainly concentrated in the lower reaches of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya river basins, where the dominant drought periods were 2007 and 2018. Second, the centroids of the largest drought patches were mainly located in the northeast, northwest, and southwest regions of Central Asia. Central Asia experienced a continuous drought from 2002 to 2005, and then a gradual wetting from 2008 to 2017. Third, the drought–wetness variation can be attributed to the variation of water vapor flux in the typical barometric layer as well as the variation of precipitation and temperature. The ASWI may play an essential role in drought monitoring and tracking prediction, particularly for drought risk mitigation and aversion.",

      "abstract": "Droughts, due to their complex nature, are difficult to predict; however, research is showing that there are often clearly defined patterns to their occurrence. The temporal aspects are usually more apparent when comparing regions with defined climatic characteristics, such as those with recognized wet or dry seasons, but recognizing these patterns can help in defining and understanding the overall processes influencing drought occurrence. Especially in the context of climate change, it is crucial to recognize temporal patterns and quantify them to help diagnose current and future event probabilities. The objective of this work is to introduce a new tool for assessing temporal patterns of streamflow drought, based on the harmonic oscillator theorem called the harmonic oscillator seasonal trend (HOST) model. The testing dataset consists of monthly minimal flows and drought occurrence information calculated based on daily flows from the National Water Model (NWM) retrospective v.2.1 dataset for the period 1979–2020. The model framework allows for trend and seasonality signal decomposition as well as the extraction of the first five harmonics by means of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based machine learning algorithm. The model framework enables the extraction and evaluation of five different harmonic models based on short and long-range components as well as linear regression sloped harmonics. The results show that the best-fit models are based on two superimposed sinusoidal functions with an accuracy of around 70–90 % for streamflow drought occurrence, with different spatial parameters reflecting varied environmental conditions. The models were able to capture two patterns: (1) annual precipitation variation and (2) longer-term inertia, the latter of which is likely driven by large-scale circulation with a roughly-eight year period.",

      "abstract": "Intense short-term meteorological drought may lead to rapid declines in soil moisture, triggering flash drought that can cause major agricultural or socioeconomic damage. Machine learning methods have proven effective in forecasting hydrometeorology, but short-term drought forecasting is still inadequate. We developed a pentad-time-scale (5-day) standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI-5d) to quantify short-term meteorological drought and analyzed its spatiotemporal distribution characteristics in China during the period 1962–2018. We used historical SPEI-5d as input and employed five machine learning methods for drought hindcasting: an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), random forest (RF), recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM). The results show the following: (1) During the period 1962–2018, 61.9% of the study region showed decreasing trends in drought severity, while 69.6% of the region showed increasing trends in drought intensity. (2) Drought duration, severity, and intensity have distinct seasonal characteristics, and different forecasting models perform differently in each season, with generally lower forecasting accuracy in summer and higher forecasting accuracy in winter. (3) The ConvLSTM model can capture spatiotemporal information well compared to traditional time-series forecasting models; it has the best performance (root mean square error = 0.29, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency = 0.92) in the test set and has high forecasting accuracy (R 2 > 0.8) for lead times of 1–5 days (with accuracy decreasing as lead time increases). Our findings highlight the spatiotemporal variability of short-term meteorological drought and provide valuable scientific insights for short-term meteorological drought forecasting at 1–5 days of lead time.",

Generally, meteorological drought is the fuse of hydrological drought; thus, it is important to understand the characteristics of meteorological drought and its propagation to hydrological drought for early warning. Taking the Pearl River Basin (PRB) in China as study area, this study adopted K-means cluster analysis method to divide the PRB into subregions with similar precipitation characteristics. Then, standardized precipitation index and standardized runoff index were used to analyze the characteristics of meteorological drought and hydrological drought, respectively, and the maximum Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the drought propagation time (DPT) between these two types of drought. Moreover, the link between meteorological drought and hydrological drought was explored based on continuous wavelet transform and cross wavelet transform. The results revealed that: the PRB has experienced severe meteorological and hydrological droughts since early 2000s, and hydrological drought was more serious than meteorological drought in each of the five subregions in the PRB. The DPTs from meteorological drought to hydrological drought were mainly 2-6 months, and the periodic characteristics of meteorological drought were mainly responsible for those of hydrological drought. Precipitation and runoff could greatly affect the DPT, while the impacts of evapotranspiration and shallow soil moisture on the DPT were not significant. Furthermore, El-Niño Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation are important factors that affect the DPT from meteorological to hydrological drought in the PRB.",

Here we first chose two drought indices including standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index (scPDSI) to reflect and analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of drought in the subtropical China. Then, the validated CASA (Carnegie-Amer-Stanford Approach) model was applied to estimate forest net primary productivity (NPP) and further quantify the contributions of drought events and their characteristics on forest NPP. The results showed that drought events during 2000–2015 have resulted in a mean decline of forest NPP of 7.2%. Moderate or severe drought events reduced NPP more significantly than extremely severe drought events. In addition, there was 1–2 years of lagging in the NPP responses to drought, and the lagging time varied with forest types. Our study suggests that forest managers and local governments should pay more attention to the places with moderate and severe drought events, and take measures to avoid NPP decline within the 2 years after drought. Our study also provides data support for further identifying the contribution of drought to ecosystem carbon fluxes in the subtropical China.",

      "abstract": "Study Region A district of the Sanjiang Plain, China. Study focus Aiming at assessing the likelihood of groundwater exposure to drought in the present and future, a comprehensive evaluation framework based on the groundwater drought vulnerability index (GDVI) is proposed. Firstly, nine influencing factors are selected in terms of groundwater dependence, hydrogeology, and meteorology, and the current drought vulnerability is assessed by combining the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and random forest (RF) models. Afterwards, by projecting land use and future climate under the shared socioeconomic pathways of SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5, and SSP5–8.5, the GDVI is calculated for three future periods, i.e., 2015–2039, 2040–2064, and 2065–2089. New hydrological insights for the region More than 30% of the groundwater experiences high and very high vulnerability during the baseline period, concentrated in areas with arable land and a thick clay cover. With rising temperatures and the rapid expansion of paddy fields, areas of high-vulnerability will continue to expand and will exceed 50% by the middle of the 21st century. If the groundwater irrigation and the agricultural land development are not restricted, the groundwater drought will be exacerbated. The proposed evaluation framework can be used in other areas with high groundwater use or where groundwater resources are at risk of depletion, and the findings provide guidance for agricultural development planning and joint surface water-groundwater scheduling.",

      "abstract": "The UK has experienced recurring hydrological droughts in the past and their frequency and severity are predicted to increase with climate change. However, quantifying the risks of extreme droughts is challenging given the short observational record, the multivariate nature of droughts and large internal variability of the climate system. We use EC-Earth time-slice large ensembles, which consist of 2000 years of data each for present-day, 2°C and 3°C conditions relative to pre-industrial, to drive hydrological models of river catchments in Great Britain (GB) to obtain a large set of plausible droughts. Since future warming is certain, the uncertainty in drought is mainly associated with uncertainty in precipitation. Estimates of unprecedented extremes show that the chance of a summer month in a given year drier than the observed driest summer (1995) is projected to increase with future warming (from 9% in the present-day (PD) to 18% in a 3°C warmer world (3C) for southeast England). For winter, the chance of a dry winter month drier than the observed driest winter (1991–92) slightly decreases (from 10% - PD to 8% − 3C for southeast England) but the chance of the driest winter does not change significantly with future warming. We add value to these probabilistic estimates by sampling for physical climate storylines of drought sequences characterised by dry spring-summers, autumn-winters and consecutive dry winters. Dry spring-summers are estimated to become drier with future warming primarily driven by reduced precipitation in summer. Dry autumn-winters may become wetter mainly driven by the general trend of more precipitation in winter although drought conditions triggered by moderate autumn–winter precipitation deficits may worsen given the higher likelihood of being followed by a dry summer. Similarly, drought impacts of consecutive dry winters, a particular risk for slow-responding catchments in the English Lowlands, may worsen with future warming as the intervening summer is projected to become hotter and drier. These storylines can be used to stress-test hydrological systems and inform decision-making.",

      "citations": 9,
      "abstract": "Drought is one of the most devastating phenomena that affect the livelihood of most communities in Ethiopia as they have low adaptive capacity. Recent advancements in remote sensing and drought investigations have made it possible to identify a new type of flash drought that has rapid intensification with a short duration (i.e., less than 1 month unlike conventional droughts). This study intends to identify flash drought in the Awash River Basin (ARB) based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data of actual evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration using Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI) and Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) indices. The flash drought result exhibited that agricultural lands, grasslands, vegetation areas, and irrigational croplands along the river were vulnerable to flash drought in the ARB. Using ESI, the area of ARB that experienced flash drought in 2002, 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2015 were 23%, 40%, 20%, 40%, and 24%, respectively. These intense flash drought areas can be used as drought monitoring sites. The flash drought extent of EDDI is more compared to ESI because of ESI’s dependency on vegetation coverages and soil moisture. The lowland downstream part of the ARB is highly prone to flash drought, particularly in the major rainy season (MRS) and the last two months of the minor rainy season (mRS). EDDI can discern the onset of flash drought better compared to ESI, but both can be used as a drought early warning mechanisms to minimize agricultural losses and drought-associated risks in the basin.",

      "abstract": "To study the propagation law of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts under variable time scales, and to reveal the synchronisation gap and lag time of hydrological droughts compared to meteorological droughts, and the lag degree of hydrological drought is quantitatively studied. In this paper, the Yellow River Water Supply Area in Henan is taken as the research area, and the propagation time of meteorological drought to hydrological drought under variable time scale is mainly studied. The calculation of drought propagation time is set as two states: interval scale and continuous scale. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) sequence and Standardized Runoff Index (SRI) sequence (1)with interval and continuous scales were obtained by multi-scale standardization of precipitation and runoff, which were used to characterize meteorological drought and hydrological drought respectively. The Mann-Kendall (M−K) test method was used to analyze the evolution of SPI sequence and SRI sequence at monthly scale, and to study the lag time of hydrological drought in four seasons compared with meteorological drought. Combining the Grey Correlation Method and Pearson correlation coefficient methods, the time interval for the propagation of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts was determined based on the strongest correlation of different combinations of sequences. Finally, the propagation time series is divided into sliding windows to analyse the M−K dynamic trend of propagation time from a seasonal scale perspective. It provides a strong basis for the study of drought propagation based on multi-scale.",

The risk, memory, and causality of this combination can be expressed by a compound dynamic perspective under a changing climate. In this study, we show that the concurrent risk of hydrological and metrological droughts has increased by up to 10% to 20% for moderate and severe events, and up to 8% to 12% for extreme events in recent decades, across watersheds in the western and southeastern Contiguous United States (CONUS). A bivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model also indicates that the dynamic compound droughts have strong short-term memory based on co-volatility, especially in the western CONUS. The results also suggest a short-memory causative dynamic mechanism, through which meteorological droughts may exponentially increase the occurrence of long-lasting and severe compound droughts, especially in the western CONUS. Given the broad impacts of extreme compound droughts, our findings have critical relevance for the ongoing proactive and long-term adaptive plans to mitigate adverse consequences arising from droughts, especially in the western territories of the CONUS.",

Spatially, an analysis based on rotational empirical orthogonal function identifies five regions of similar drought variability, namely the Sahel, East Africa, East Southern Africa, West Southern Africa and the Gulf of Guinea. Temporally, the most common periods of drought occurrence are the 1970s, the 1980s and, to a lesser extent, the 1990s. Changes in drought characteristics for the intermediate past (1958–1987) and recent past (1988–2017) compared to the far past (1928–1957) indicate robust increases of drought duration, frequency and severity in the Sahel, and to a lower extent in the Gulf of Guinea, some areas of Central Africa, part of Southern Africa and over Madagascar. These changes are stronger (weaker) along the Sahel during the intermediate past (recent past) and stronger (weaker) over Central and Southern Africa and Madagascar during the recent past (intermediate past). As a consequence, drought hot spots, mostly driven by severity during the regions' wet season, are identified in areas confined in the Sahel during the intermediate past and in regions mainly over Central and Southern Africa and Madagascar during the recent past. Our results are useful for drought disaster risk management across Africa and provide a valuable reference for future drought analysis under global warming conditions.",

      "journal": "International Journal of Climatology",
      "citations": 6,
      "abstract": "The Yangtze River basin (YRB) has experienced frequent extreme drought events in recent years. Many studies have explored the impact of anomalous tropical sea surface temperatures on seasonal meteorological droughts over the YRB, yet two critical issues remain: (1) the regimes of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) causing YRB droughts; (2) the timing and spatial pattern of YRB droughts caused by ENSO and IOD. To address these knowledge gaps, we employed a comprehensive investigation. First, the Severity–Area–Density (SAD) method is applied to identify seasonal drought events over the YRB during 1971–2022. Second, we utilize composite analysis to specify the effects of ENSO and IOD. Our findings indicate that YRB droughts are significantly increased in the August of combined Eastern Pacific (EP) El Niño and positive IOD developing years, October of Central Pacific (CP) El Niño developing years, January of EP La Niña years, and April of CP El Niño decaying years. Third, we conduct numerical simulations and conclude that ENSO and IOD events contribute to the YRB droughts by modulating large‐scale circulation patterns, triggering the formation of cyclones and anticyclones over the Western North Pacific (WNP) and the Tibetan Plateau, and affecting the westerlies and other water vapour transport processes. These results on the physical mechanisms causing seasonal drought in the YRB can guide drought monitoring and prediction in the region.",

      "citations": 1,
      "abstract": "This study examines the impacts of 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C global warming levels (GWLs) on the characteristics of four major drought modes over Eastern Africa in the future under two climate forcing scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The droughts were quantified using two drought indices: the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and the standardized precipitation index (SPI) at 12-month scale. Four major drought modes were identified with the principal component analysis (PCA). Multi-model simulation datasets from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) were analysed for the study. The skill of the models to reproduce the spatial distribution and frequency of past drought modes over Eastern Africa was examined by comparing the simulated results with the Climate Research Unit (CRU) observation. The models give realistic simulations of the historical drought modes over the region. The correlation between the simulated and observed spatial pattern of the drought modes is high ( r ≥ 0.7). Over the hotspot of the drought modes, the observed drought frequency is within the simulated values, and the simulations agree with the observation that the frequency of SPI-12 droughts is less than that of SPEI-12 droughts. For both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, the simulation ensemble projects no changes in the spatial structure of the drought modes but suggests an increase in SPEI-12 drought intensity and frequency over the hotspots of the drought modes. The magnitude of the increase, which varies over the drought mode hotspots, is generally higher at 2 °C than at 1.5 °C global warming levels. More than 75% of the simulations agree on these projections. The projections also show that the increase in drought intensity and frequency is more from increased potential evapotranspiration than from reduced precipitation. Hence, the study suggests that to reduce impacts of global warming on future drought, the adaptation activities should focus on reducing evaporative loss surface water.",

      "citations": 3,
      "abstract": "Independently, both droughts and heatwaves can induce severe impacts on human and natural systems. However, when these two climate extremes occur concurrently in a given region, their compound impacts are often more pronounced. With the improvement in both the spatiotemporal resolution and representation of complex climate processes in the global climate models (GCMs), they are increasingly used to study future changes in these extremes and associated regional impacts. However, GCM selection for such impact assessments is generally based on historical performance and/or future mean changes, without considering individual or compound extremes. In contrast, this study evaluates historical performance and projected changes in heatwaves, droughts, and compound heatwave-droughts using an ensemble of GCMs from the latest Phase 6 of Coupled Models Intercomparison Project at a regional scale across the conterminous United States. Additionally, we explore the inter-model differences in the projected changes that are associated with various characteristics of extremes and the choice of drought indices. Our analysis reveals considerable variation among the GCMs, as well as substantial differences in the projected changes based on the choice of drought indices and region of interest. For example, the projected increases in both the frequency and intensity of drought and associated compound extreme days, based on the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index far exceed those derived from the standard precipitation index. Further, the largest changes in the frequency of compound extremes are projected over the Southwest, South Central, and parts of the Southeast while the smallest changes are projected over the Northeast. Overall, this study provides important insights for the interpretation and selection of GCMs for future assessment studies that are crucial for the development of regional adaptation strategies in the face of climate change.",

      "citations": 24,
      "abstract": "The economic and human losses caused by drought are increasing, driven by climate change, human activities, and increased exposure of livelihood activities in water‐dependent sectors. Mitigation of these impacts for socio‐ecological securit is necessary to gain a better understanding of how human activities contribute to the propagation of drought as water management further develops. The previous studies investigated the impact of human activities on a macro level, but they overlooked the specific effects caused by human water management measures. In addition, most studies focus on the propagation time (PT, the number of months from meteorological drought propagation to hydrological drought), while other drought propagation characteristics, such as duration, magnitude, and recovery time, are not yet sufficiently understood. To tackle these issues, the PCR‐GLOBWB v2.0 hydrological model simulated hydrological processes in China under natural and human‐influenced scenarios. The study assessed how human activities impact hydrological drought and its propagation. Result shows that human activities have exacerbated hydrological drought in northern China, while it is mitigated in the south. The propagation rate (PR, proportion of meteorological drought propagation to hydrological drought) ranges from 45% to 75%, and the PT is 6–23 months. The PR does not differ substantially between the north and south, while the PT is longer in the north. The PR decreases by 1%–60% due to human activities, and the PT decreases (1–13 months) in the north and increases (1–10 months) in the south. Human activities display significant variations in how they influence the propagation process of drought across different basins. The primary factors driving the spatial pattern of drought disparities are regional variations in irrigation methods and the storage capacity of reservoirs.",

      "abstract": "The frequency and severity of extreme climatic phenomena, including droughts, have increased across the globe. The aim of this study is to detect changes in the severity and trends of short- and medium- term droughts (3 and 12 months) across Iran (1990–2019) and project the near (2059–2030) and far (2095–2066) future changes. SPI and SPEI indices were used for this purpose. The non-parametric Mann–Kendall test was used for trend analysis, and the G * (Geties and Ord) index was exerted for hot spot analysis. The results revealed that in 1990–2020, except for 3 month SPI (SPI3) index, the SPI and SPEI trends tended to be negative and statistically significant at the 0.05 significance level. During the same period, specified and significant hot spots of the indices were formed in the northern and northwestern Iran, and significant cold spots were concentrated only in Zabol and Birjand stations in eastern Iran. Near and far future minimum and maximum monthly precipitation projections for four selected stations show increases in monthly maximum and minimum temperatures and decreases in precipitation at all stations, though the decrease in precipitation for Esfahan station only with RCP8.5. The Projected trends of 3 and 12 months SPI and SPEI (SPI3, SPI12, SPEI3 and SPEI12) in near and far future show the dominance of significant negative trends. Projected trends of SPI and SPEI for the near future was negative for all stations, though it was positive and significant for far future.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 9,
      "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that climate stress may cause asynchronous changes between greenness and productivity, but the mechanism how greenness and productivity respond to drought remains unclear. The significant greening of vegetation in China has attracted worldwide attention; nevertheless, it is unclear whether large-scale greening will translate into productivity in the context of recent droughts. In this study, we used the vegetation index dataset to extract long-term trends in vegetation greenness and productivity from 1982 to 2018, and then chose the multi-scale Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) index to measure how vegetation greenness and productivity change in response to drought. The results show that significant vegetation greening did not cause a simultaneous increase in productivity during 1982–2018. Vegetation greenness and productivity trends were relatively consistent before 2000 and diverged after 2000, especially during the prolonged drought of 2000–2009. The opposite trend between greenness and productivity in humid ecosystems during drought periods mainly caused this trend difference. In humid ecosystems, short-term drought promotes vegetation greening, while long-term drought has no significant impact on greenness. However, the inhibitory effect of drought on productivity deepens with an increase in drought duration. Therefore, prolonged droughts offset vegetation greenness-induced gross primary productivity. We also found that prolonged drought causes a significant decrease in greenness but has little effect on productivity in arid ecosystems, possibly because vegetation productivity is more sensitive to soil water than atmospheric drought. Our results highlight the complexity of vegetation growth in the context of climate change. Furthermore, it is crucial to pay attention to the impact of climate stress on regional carbon sequestration functions, considering the significant carbon sink potential of forest areas in southern China.",

      "citations": 2,
      "abstract": "The occurrence of compound drought and hot events has been shown to cause stronger socio-economic, environmental and health impacts than the isolated events. Moreover, the frequency of these compound events has increased unevenly throughout the world and is expected to keep increasing in several regions. In this work, an assessment of compound drought and hot events in the summer months in Australia was made, using copula functions. Drought and hot conditions were identified by the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the indices Number of Hot Days (NHD) and Number of Hot Nights (NHN) for the summer months, respectively. We analysed drought conditions in the current and the previous 1 to 3 months and the periods 1950–1978 and 1979–2020. The results show that the conditional probability of the occurrence of hot events given drought conditions is very high for the concurrent month in most of the study area, reaching 0.9 in some cases. Considering previous drought conditions, the higher probabilities are obtained in the southeastern region in December and in the north in February but, in most of the study area, these values are higher than for the case of non-drought conditions, pointing to an effect of previous drought conditions on hot events of up to 3 months. Moreover, an increased frequency of compound drought and hot events from the first to the second period was identified in more than half of the study area for lags of 1 and 2 months. We show that, although the conditional probabilities are mostly higher when computed with NHD, NHN is also affected by drought conditions, and should also be considered in this analysis, since nights can have a relieving contribution when impacts in health and wildfires are being analysed.",

      "title": "A robust integrated agricultural drought index under climate and land use variations at the local scale in Pakistan",
      "journal": "Agricultural Water Management",
      "citations": 8,
      "abstract": "This study aims to develop an integrated agricultural drought index (IADI) that incorporates multiple remote sensing-based agricultural drought indices, considering variations in climate and land use at a local scale in ten different agro-ecological zones (AEZs) of Pakistan from 2000 to 2020. The IADI focuses on soil moisture stress to vegetation, utilizing the soil moisture condition index (SMCI) derived from various soil moisture datasets. The correlation between SMCI and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) is assessed at different time scales (1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month) using Pearson correlation coefficient (r). Results indicate that SMCI ERA5-Land is superior to others and is selected to develop the IADI. To account for local variations in climate and land use, agricultural drought indices (ADIs) are calculated on a 0.25°×0.25° grids. These ADIs are then averaged over a 3×3 window and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to understand the causal relationship between SMCI ERA5-Land and ADIs. Temperature condition index (TCI) and vegetation health index (VHI) demonstrate a significant causal relationship with SMCI ERA5-Land in most AEZs, while the relationship between temperature-vegetation dryness index (TVDI) and vegetation condition index (VCI) with SMCI ERA5-Land is insignificant across the AEZs except in northern Pakistan. The dominance of land surface temperature (LST)-derived indices in most AEZs highlights the role of temperature in drought onset and propagation. To develop the IADI, Bayesian principal component analysis (BPCA) is employed to calculate dynamic weights between the selected ADIs and SMCI ERA5-Land . The distribution of BPCA weights exhibits extreme variability across different AEZs, with some windows being sensitive to LST-derived ADIs and others to NDVI-derived ADIs. The average BPCA weights for VCI, TCI, VHI, and TVDI range from 9.42%–23.05%, 23.20–49.83%, 13.00–31.08%, and 16.38–25.50%, respectively. The IADI demonstrates the best fit with TCI and VHI, while showing good agreement with SPEI, VCI, and TVDI. The correlation between IADI and TCI/VHI ranges from 0.62/0.72–0.94/0.97. Furthermore, ordinary least square regression (OLSR) is used to assess the accuracy of IADI, ADIs, and SPEI in analyzing the impact of drought on wheat/maize yield at the district level in Punjab province, Pakistan. OLSR analysis reveals the dominance of IADI, followed by VHI, in analyzing the role of drought on crop yield. For example, in Rajanpur district, one unit increase in drought severity results in an 11.94 t/ha decrease in maize yield, with IADI explaining 59% of the variations in maize yield. Similarly, one unit increase in drought severity leads to a 7.22 t/ha decrease in wheat yield, with IADI explaining 49% of the variations in wheat yield. Overall, results indicate that the developed IADI effectively captures agricultural drought with high spatial and temporal resolutions across different agro-ecological zones, providing valuable insights for monitoring agricultural drought in data-scarce regions.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the full propagation process of drought, from meteorological drought (MD) to vegetation drought (VD), could promote drought monitoring and early warning in the ecosystems. This study characterized MD, soil moisture drought (SD), and VD and their propagations using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), the Soil Moisture Anomaly Percentage Index (SMAPI), and the Vegetation Health Index (VHI) to enhance understanding of the drought hazard in the Yellow River Basin (YRB), China. Drought events, duration, magnitude, intensity, and interval were identified from these time series via the run theory and percentile thresholds. The relationships between MD, SD, and VD were examined by cross-correlating the SPEI, SMAPI, and VHI. Finally, the effects of climate and grid properties on drought characteristics and propagations were investigated. The results showed that the upland had a low risk for all droughts, while the midland had a low risk for MD and a high risk for SD, and the lowland had a high risk for MD in the YRB. For the full-time data, the lowland had the strongest correlations and shortest time lags, while the upland had the weakest correlations and longest time lags for full propagation from MD to SD to VD. However, seasonality and multi-threshold characteristics in extreme drought dominated the propagation process of VD. For monthly data, midland showed the strongest correlations and shortest time lags in summer, while lowland showed the strongest correlations and shortest time lags in other seasons for full propagation of VD. For multi-threshold data, the 0–30th percentile had stronger correlations and shorter time lags for full propagation of VD. Meteorology showed a stronger correlation with all drought characteristics and drought propagation than soil properties and land use. These findings provide valuable insights for enhancing the vegetation aspects of drought monitoring and early warning in the YRB.",

The optimal parameters-based geographical detector (OPGD) model and machine learning (including random forest model and Shapley-XGBoost algorithm) were applied to reveal the spatial and time dynamic driving forces of droughts. New hydrological insights for the regions Results indicated that warm-type droughts occurred more frequently and with greater intensity, exhibiting a larger spatial coverage compared to dry-type droughts, which can be attributed to warm-type droughts dominated by temperature and vapor pressure deficit, whereas dry-type are predominantly influenced by relative humidity and solar radiation. Moreover, the dynamics of snow droughts exhibited a contrasting pattern between the south (experiencing an upward trend) and the north (experiencing a descending trend). In the south, dry-type droughts were exacerbated by the strength of North Pacific Oscillation (PDO)-precipitation coupling, while warm-type droughts are influenced by the strength of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)-precipitation coupling and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-precipitation.",

      "abstract": "Groundwater drought is distinctive comparing with other droughts, featuring high concealment, long duration, and obvious hysteresis. It may have significant negative effects on agriculture, eco-environment, and social economy sectors. Therefore, investigating the temporal and spatial characteristics of groundwater drought and its driving factors is meaningful for monitoring and assessing the risks of groundwater shortage. In this study, a groundwater drought index based on groundwater storage anomalies (GWSAs) derived from GRACE satellites was developed to detect and analyze drought events. The spatiotemporal variations and trends of historical groundwater droughts from 2002 to 2021 in the North China Plain were evaluated. In addition, the correlations between groundwater drought and meteorological and agricultural drought were analyzed by the detrended cross-correlation analysis. The results indicated that (1) the standardized groundwater storage anomaly index (SGSAI) could better identify and characterize groundwater drought by eliminating the spatial heterogeneity of GWSAs; (2) from 2002 to 2021, the intensity, frequency, duration, and area of groundwater drought showed an increasing trend; (3) groundwater drought had an obvious hysteresis (>9 months) to meteorological drought and the correlation between groundwater drought and meteorological drought increased, while the relationship with agricultural drought decreased; (4) long-term overexploitation of groundwater resources might be the main driving factor for the exacerbating groundwater drought in this area.",

      "journal": "Agricultural Water Management",

      "abstract": "The dynamic interplay between socioeconomic development and climate change has brought about significant changes in drought vulnerability within the African socioeconomic system. However, there is a prevailing lack of understanding about how these changes will manifest in an increasingly globalized economy under global warming. To address this knowledge gap, this study used various climatic, geographical, and socioeconomic data from historical periods and future projections to comprehensively assess the drought vulnerability in North and West Africa. Firstly, the drought vulnerability index (DVI) is calculated for every country to determine its accuracy and reliability based on the 26 elements and five components (i.e. health, energy and infrastructure, water resources, society, and economy). The datasets are collected for North and West African regions from the World Bank, AQUASTAT (global information system on water resources and agricultural water management), and the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations during 1980–2020. The calculated DVI is then compared to earlier observations of drought consequences. Then, using historical variations and trends, a regression models are applied to the historical DVI time-series for each country and projected for the years 2020–2100 to produce three forecast scenarios for DVI in the future (high, medium, and low). The findings indicate that in North and West Africa, Tunisia, Egypt, and Algeria are the regions least affected by drought with a DVI value between 0.2 and 0.4, while Niger, Chad, and Mauritania are the most vulnerable regions with a DVI value between 0.6 and 1. Future DVI forecasts show that the gap between high - and low -vulnerable countries will enlarge, with most northern African regions becoming less drought-vulnerable and most western African regions showing increased drought vulnerability. The results of this study are primarily helpful in performing risk assessments, developing response plans or making adaptation decisions to help communities consider possible ways to address anticipated current and future threats resulting from drought and to reduce vulnerability and enhance resilience of the system, coping with recurring drought in the coming decades.",

      "abstract": "Hydrological drought (HD) in dynamic environments, particularly complicated by climate change and human activity, challenges traditional stationary-based research approaches. These challenges are particularly pronounced in the Upper Red River Basin characterized by complex topography and extensive human activity. To these issues, this study introduces non-stationarity in determining drought propagation time and develops a Non-Stationary ImpactQuant Framework (NSIQF) to assess human activity impacts on HD's frequency and propagation processes. Implementing non-stationarity involves using the Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape to construct the Non-stationary Standardized Runoff Index (NSRI), which is employed for attribution analysis and determining drought propagation time. We systematically quantified human activity impacts by comparing NSRI with drought indices and propagation time derived from reconstructed natural runoff. Our findings indicate that the NSRI is more adept at capturing drought characteristics in changing environments than the traditional Standardized Runoff Index. The human activity impacts on HD in the study area exhibits distinct temporal characteristics. Human activity contributed to 42.64% of the HD at 12-month scales, and 29.28%, 17.68%,19.14%, and 24.82% in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. They prolonged the propagation time from meteorological drought to HD by 1–5 months. Land use change is a potential primary anthropogenic factor. Effective management and strategic interventions for predominantly agricultural activity constitute viable solutions to alleviate regional drought and enhance drought resistance.",

      "abstract": "Extreme-flow events have been a central point of interest in hydrology and recent developments suggest that their role could be critical in the overall functioning of watershed systems. The development of modelling techniques that can effectively reproduce the hydrological dynamics of watersheds during extreme events is one of the challenges of the contemporary modelling practice. In this study, we present a season-specific, multi-site calibration framework that accommodates the variability in the hydrological responses induced by the agricultural landscape changes during different periods of the year. Our case study is the Hamilton Harbour watershed in southern Ontario, Canada, where discharge data from three main tributaries and six gauging stations were available to constrain the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Two distinct values are assigned to the Curve Number for antecedent runoff condition II (CN2), relating surface runoff to precipitation as a function of land uses and soil characteristics, in order to reproduce flow patterns during the growing and dormant seasons. Overall, notwithstanding the model performance decline in the most urbanized catchment of Redhill Creek, our season-specific calibration strategy improved the predictive capacity of the model in the predominantly agricultural catchments of Grindstone Creek and Spencer Creek. Counter to our season-specific process characterization, an alternative calibration strategy postulating a differential watershed response, depending on the magnitude of individual precipitation events, appears to fair better in urbanized settings. The water budget displays significant disparities among the different land uses in the Hamilton Harbour watershed. Our analysis also suggests that the runoff generated from urban sites during the growing season (May-October), i.e., the period when the receiving waterbody is most sensitive to eutrophication, is six times higher than the average contribution from pasture, forest, and cropland areas. The potential implications of the on-going land-use and climate-change trends for the water cycle at both local and catchment scales are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that the application of time-varying hydrological-model parameters based on dynamic catchment behavior significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of conventional models. However, the fundamental problems for calibrating dynamic parameters still need to be addressed. In this study, five calibration schemes for dynamic parameters in hydrological models were designed to investigate the underlying causes of poor model performance. The five schemes were assessed with respect to the model performance in different flow phases, the transferability of the dynamic parameters to different time periods, the state variables and fluxes time series, and the response of the dynamic parameter set to the dynamic catchment characteristics. Furthermore, the potential reasons for the poor response of the dynamic parameter set to the catchment dynamics were investigated. The results showed that the underlying causes of poor model performance included time-invariant parameters, “compensation” among parameters, high dimensionality and abrupt shifts in the parameters. The recommended calibration scheme exhibited good performance and overcame these problems by characterizing the dynamic behavior of the catchments. The main reason for the poor response of the dynamic parameter set to the catchment dynamics may be the poor convergence performance of the parameters. In addition, the assessment results of the state variables and fluxes and the convergence performance of the parameters provided robust indications of the dominant response modes of the hydrological models in different sub-periods or catchments with distinguishing catchment characteristics.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 10,
      "abstract": "Errors from hydrological simulations have substantial influence on hydrological applications. There are increasing interests to incorporate statistical models of the errors (error models) into hydrological applications to improve simulations. However, conventional error models are usually temporally unvaried and may be inadequate to handle model simulation errors when the underlying error statistics are strongly seasonal. To overcome this problem, the use of temporally varied error models in both prediction and forecasting applications are investigated. We analyze different levels of temporal granularity to identify the optimal temporally varied error model to best improve simulations and to quantify uncertainty. The Error Reduction and Representation In Stages (ERRIS) model is adapted in this study to improve streamflow simulations produced by the Variable Infiltration Capacity model for the Yarlung Tsangbo River basin. Well-marked seasonal and sub-seasonal variations in error statistics are found. Accordingly, three temporally varied ERRIS models are constructed at semi-annual (ERRIS-H), seasonal (ERRIS-S) and monthly (ERRIS-M) temporal granularity and compared with a benchmark model, the temporally unvaried model (ERRIS-A). Results show that the temporally varied ERRIS models are considerably more effective than the temporally unvaried one, with 34% reduction in continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) and 23% increase in Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) for prediction applications. With respect to forecasting applications, improvements of about 7% in CRPS are achieved by the temporally varied models. The performance of different temporally varied error models roughly follows the same order as the level of temporal granularity. Generally, ERRIS-S and ERRIS-M are similarly effective, with ERRIS-M providing additional improvement by more than 15% in CRPS for the spring season and by at least 30% for the autumn season. It is concluded that the consistency of temporal granularity between error models and variations of error statistics is the key to effective error reduction and uncertainty quantification. When complicated hydrological processes exist, hydrological model tends to produce seasonally and even sub-seasonally varied error statistics. Consequently, temporally finer error models are expected to lead to higher accuracy and reliability.",

      "journal": "Hydrology and Earth System Sciences",
      "citations": 9,
      "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that the seasonal dynamics of model parameters can compensate for structural defects of hydrological models and improve the accuracy and robustness of the streamflow forecast to some extent. However, some fundamental issues for improving model performance with seasonal dynamic parameters still need to be addressed. In this regard, this study is dedicated to (1) proposing a novel framework for seasonal variations of hydrological model parameters to improve model performance and (2) expanding the discussion on model results and the response of seasonal dynamic parameters to dynamic characteristics of catchments. The procedure of the framework is developed with (1) extraction of the dynamic catchment characteristics using current data-mining techniques, (2) subperiod calibration operations for seasonal dynamic parameters, considering the effects of the significant correlation between the parameters, the number of multiplying parameters, and the temporal memory in the model states in two adjacent subperiods on calibration operations, and (3) multi-metric assessment of model performance designed for various flow phases. The main finding is that (1) the proposed framework significantly improved the accuracy and robustness of the model; (2) however, there was a generally poor response of the seasonal dynamic parameter set to catchment dynamics. Namely, the dynamic changes in parameters did not follow the dynamics of catchment characteristics. Hence, we deepen the discussion on the poor response in terms of (1) the evolutionary processes of seasonal dynamic parameters optimized by global optimization, considering that the possible failure in finding the global optimum might lead to unreasonable seasonal dynamic parameter values. Moreover, a practical tool for visualizing the evolutionary processes of seasonal dynamic parameters was designed using geometry visualization techniques. (2) We also discuss the strong correlation between parameters considering that dynamic changes in one parameter might be interfered with by other parameters due to their interdependence. Consequently, the poor response of the seasonal dynamic parameter set to dynamic catchment characteristics may be attributed in part to the possible failure in finding the global optimum and strong correlation between parameters. Further analysis also revealed that even though individual parameters cannot respond well to dynamic catchment characteristics, a dynamic parameter set could carry the information extracted from dynamic catchment characteristics and improve the model performance.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",

      "abstract": "Monthly water balance models are valuable tools in water resources management. Unfortunately, most of these models suffer from structure complexity, large data requirements, occasionally low performance in simulating runoff, high seasonality of model residuals, and/or limited application in snow climates. By adding a seasonal component (SC), this study aims (1) to enhance the performance of the parsimonious GR2M monthly model (with only two free parameters) and (2) to increase its applicability in snow climates, without any further data requirements (as only precipitation and potential evapotranspiration monthly series are required to predict monthly runoff). The proposed model is examined at the catchment scale using 710 stations from the Hydro-Climatic Data Network, selected to cover various climatic conditions across the continental United States. Various performance criteria are calculated to compare the proposed GR2M-SC model with the original GR2M such as the Nash-Sutcliffe and Kling-Gupta efficiencies, the coefficient of determination, root mean square error and bias. Two split-sample sets are used to calibrate and validate the models. The calibration process is applied once using the first two-thirds of the dataset, and again using the last two-thirds, and each time the remaining sub-set is used for validation purposes. Furthermore, a seasonality measure is calculated to estimate the strength of seasonality in model residuals. The proposed GR2M-SC model clearly outperforms the original GR2M model as well as GR2M+, which is an improved 4-parameter version of the GR2M model with capabilities for handling snow accumulation and snowmelt. The seasonality of the proposed model residuals was also reduced.",

      "journal": "Hydrology and Earth System Sciences",
      "citations": 99,
      "abstract": "Several studies have shown that hydrological models do not perform well when applied to periods with climate conditions that differ from those during model calibration. This has important implications for the application of these models in climate change impact studies. The causes of the low transferability to changed climate conditions have, however, only been investigated in a few studies. Here we revisit a study in Austria that demonstrated the inability of a conceptual semi-distributed HBV-type model to simulate the observed discharge response to increases in precipitation and air temperature. The aim of the paper is to shed light on the reasons for these model problems. We set up hypotheses for the possible causes of the mismatch between the observed and simulated changes in discharge and evaluate these using simulations with modifications of the model. In the baseline model, trends of simulated and observed discharge over 1978–2013 differ, on average over all 156 catchments, by mm yr per 35 years. Accounting for variations in vegetation dynamics, as derived from a satellite-based vegetation index, in the calculation of reference evaporation explains mm yr per 35 years of the differences between the trends in simulated and observed discharge. Inhomogeneities in the precipitation data, caused by a variable number of stations, explain mm yr per 35 years of this difference. Extending the calibration period from 5 to 25 years, including annually aggregated discharge data or snow cover data in the objective function, or estimating evaporation with the Penman–Monteith instead of the Blaney–Criddle approach has little influence on the simulated discharge trends (5 mm yr per 35 years or less). The precipitation data problem highlights the importance of using precipitation data based on a stationary input station network when studying hydrologic changes. The model structure problem with respect to vegetation dynamics is likely relevant for a wide spectrum of regions in a transient climate and has important implications for climate change impact studies.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 26,
      "abstract": "River monitoring is a critical issue for hydrological modelling that strongly relies on the use of Flow Rating Curves (FRCs). In most of the cases, FRCs are approximated by least-squares fitting, whose performance may be influenced by measurements variability, which is often limited in high values. In this context, a new formulation has been recently introduced to exploit available knowledge on cross-sectional geometry for a more robust derivation of FRCs. This method combines the wetted-area/stage and the cross-sectionally averaged velocity/stage functions in the FRCs derivation limiting, at least partially, the uncertainty in the extrapolation of higher discharge values. The methodology is tested on four gauged cross-sections of the Tiber River basin, where a relatively high number of measurements are available. This dataset is used to test the reliability of the new approach with respect to the classic method in relatively stable river cross-sections. A jackknifing approach is used to understand the role played by the number of gaugings and range of observations on the applicability of the new formulation highlighting its advantages in data-scarce environments. In particular, we observed that the new approach becomes advantageous when the observations are limited both in terms of the range of observations or in terms of sample size (i.e., ≤10 samples).",

      "abstract": "Spatiotemporally continuous estimates of the hydrologic cycle are often generated through hydrologic modeling, reanalysis, or remote sensing (RS) methods and are commonly applied as a supplement to, or a substitute for, in situ measurements when observational data are sparse or unavailable. This study compares estimates of precipitation ( ), actual evapotranspiration (ET), runoff ( ), snow water equivalent (SWE), and soil moisture (SM) from 87 unique data sets generated by 47 hydrologic models, reanalysis data sets, and remote sensing products across the conterminous United States (CONUS). Uncertainty between hydrologic component estimates was shown to be high in the western CONUS, with median uncertainty (measured as the coefficient of variation) ranging from 11 % to 21 % for , 14 % to 26 % for ET, 28 % to 82 % for , 76 % to 84 % for SWE, and 36 % to 96 % for SM. Uncertainty between estimates was lower in the eastern CONUS, with medians ranging from 5 % to 14 % for P, 13 % to 22 % for ET, 28 % to 82 % for , 53 % to 63 % for SWE, and 42 % to 83 % for SM. Interannual trends in estimates from 1982 to 2010 show common disagreement in R, SWE, and SM. Correlating fluxes and stores against remote-sensing-derived products show poor overall correlation in the western CONUS for ET and SM estimates. Study results show that disagreement between estimates can be substantial, sometimes exceeding the magnitude of the measurements themselves. The authors conclude that multimodel ensembles are not only useful but are in fact a necessity for accurately representing uncertainty in research results. Spatial biases of model disagreement values in the western United States show that targeted research efforts in arid and semiarid water-limited regions are warranted, with the greatest emphasis on storage and runoff components, to better describe complexities of the terrestrial hydrologic system and reconcile model disagreement.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Research",
      "citations": 129,
      "abstract": "Model calibration and validation are critical in hydrological model robustness assessment. Unfortunately, the commonly used split‐sample test (SST) framework for data splitting requires modelers to make subjective decisions without clear guidelines. This large‐sample SST assessment study empirically assesses how different data splitting methods influence post‐validation model testing period performance, thereby identifying optimal data splitting methods under different conditions. This study investigates the performance of two lumped conceptual hydrological models calibrated and tested in 463 catchments across the United States using 50 different data splitting schemes. These schemes are established regarding the data availability, length and data recentness of continuous calibration sub‐periods (CSPs). A full‐period CSP is also included in the experiment, which skips model validation. The assessment approach is novel in multiple ways including how model building decisions are framed as a decision tree problem and viewing the model building process as a formal testing period classification problem, aiming to accurately predict model success/failure in the testing period. Results span different climate and catchment conditions across a 35‐year period with available data, making conclusions quite generalizable. Calibrating to older data and then validating models on newer data produces inferior model testing period performance in every single analysis conducted and should be avoided. Calibrating to the full available data and skipping model validation entirely is the most robust split‐sample decision. Experimental findings remain consistent no matter how model building factors (i.e., catchments, model types, data availability, and testing periods) are varied. Results strongly support revising the traditional split‐sample approach in hydrological modeling.",

      "title": "Detecting the interactions between vegetation greenness and drought globally",
      "journal": "Atmospheric Research",
      "citations": 15,
      "abstract": "Drought changes can profoundly influence vegetation growth while vegetation, in turn, may impact drought by modulating water and energy exchanges between the land and atmosphere. Previous studies have primarily focused on the unidirectional effects of drought on vegetation dynamics. However, the impacts of vegetation on drought and their bidirectional dependencies have remained underexplored. In this study, we employ the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and two drought indices (the Standardized Precipitation Index, SPI, and, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, SPEI) to investigate the interaction between vegetation greenness and drought globally over the period 2001 to 2020. The results demonstrate a statistically significant and consistent trend between LAI and SPI (SPEI) in 66.9% (54.01%) of global vegetated lands. SPI commonly displays a 2-month delayed response to LAI, whereas SPEI shows no evident lag, implying a more rapid response of SPEI to LAI compared to SPI. A substantial proportion of global vegetated areas, around 66% for LAI-SPI and 52% for LAI-SPEI, exhibit a significant positive relationship. The Granger causality test reveals a bidirectional causal relationship between vegetation greenness and drought across approximately 20% of global vegetated areas. Vegetation greenness is identified as the Granger cause of SPI (SPEI) in >60% (30%) of global vegetated lands, providing statistical observational evidence indicating that vegetation can influence drought in many regions within terrestrial ecosystems. Interestingly, the ratio of areas where LAI serves as the Granger cause of SPI is more extensive than the corresponding ratio where SPI is identified as the Granger cause of LAI, a pattern opposite to that observed with SPEI. Overall, our investigation into the interactions between vegetation greenness and drought holds significance for enhancing our understanding of land-atmosphere interplays in the context of climate change and contributes to advancing sustainable development for ecosystem services.",

      "citations": 17,
      "abstract": "In applied hydrology, estimating the peak flood discharge in ungauged or poorly gauged river sections is vital for urbanized areas. Spatially distributed rainfall data such as weather radar data may be a good choice to represent the driving force in hydrologic models for ungauged regions. However, it is important to examine the accuracy of this product, especially over mountainous regions. The bias between radar rainfall and rain gauge rainfall can be progressively removed by using information provided by rain gauges. The Kalman Filter algorithm is applied for the mean field bias correction of radar rainfall data using past estimates and observations. Regarding the bias-correction methods, two filtering approaches are developed from 8 events observed at 13 rain gauge stations, and the bias-corrected radar (BCR) rainfall data are used to compare simulated and observed hydrographs for the three flood events that caused severe consequences in Samsun–Terme. It is found out that in frontal type rainfall, BCR rainfall estimates improve the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency from 0.56 to 0.80 in runoff simulation of the event occurred on 22 November 2014; however, simulations of the event occurred on 2 August 2015 and 28 May 2016 have poorer statistical results probably owing to the effect of convective type rainfall and snow melting, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Globally, flood is one of the devastating hydrometeorological disasters, causing human losses and damages to properties and infrastructure. There is a need to determine and geo-visualize flood risk to assist decision-making process for flood risk reduction. The current study is a local level pioneering attempt regarding the spatial appraisal of flood risk assessment and evaluation in Panjkora River Basin, eastern Hindu Kush. An integrated hydro-probabilistic approach is implemented by clubbing the results of Hydrologic Engineering Centre’s River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) and Hydrologic Engineering Centre’s Geographic River Analysis System (HEC-Geo-RAS) in geographic information system (GIS) environment. An Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) is used as input data to delineate the target basin and generation of river geometry. Hydraulic and hydrological data were used to estimate and geo-visualize vertical profile and spatial extent of various floods in the active floodplain of Panjkora River. Gumbel’s frequency distribution model is applied in analyzing daily peak discharge recorded during the past 32 years, and 200-year flood magnitude (1392m 3 /sec), probable inundation (45.5 km 2 ), and vertical profile (19 m) are modeled. Analysis revealed that likelihood of such flood has increased the risk of potential damages to roads (46 km), retaining walls (49 km), bridges (16), and culverts (46). The analysis further revealed that built-up area (10.4 km 2 ) and agricultural land (20.2 km 2 ) will also come under flood with life loss. The resultant flood risk zones and spatial appraisal will definitely help in bringing down the probable flood damages. Similarly, current study has potential to assist disaster managers, hydraulic engineers, and policy makers to understand the flood risk and implement location-specific effective flood risk reduction strategies.",

      "citations": 66,
      "abstract": "Flood is one of the major natural disasters which cause enormous casualties and damages particularly in urban areas. In urban areas, studies on flood hazards have been accompanied by tensions for various reasons, including complexity of urban levels, different spatial modeling indices, lack of accurate hydrological data, and precise modeling of land surface simulations. This paper used a Constrained Delaunay Triangular Irregular Network to model fine urban surfaces (based on the detailed ground sampling data), and subsequently discusses five indicators regarding the dangers of flood, namely (1) elevation, (2) slope, (3) distance to discharge channels, (4) index of development and persistence of the drainage network (IDPR), and (5) infiltration rate. In the next step for flood hazard mapping, the combination of geographical information systems and the entropy weight method as the multi-criteria decision analysis was used to combine the indicators. The proposed methodology was used for Hamadan city that is located in the central part of Hamadan Province in Iran where several floods occur annually. The flood hazard mapping indicates that approximately 15.83% of the total study area is classified as very highly hazardous, 31.72% as hazardous, 20.11% as moderate, 16.02% as minor, and 16.32% as the least hazardous. Finally, superimposition and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve methods were used to verify the accuracy of the obtained flood hazard map. In terms of superimposition and ROC curve, the accuracy of the model was approximately 70% and 73%, respectively.",

      "abstract": "This research proposes and evaluates a new approach for flash flood susceptibility mapping based on Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN)) algorithm, with a case study at a high-frequency tropical storm area in the northwest mountainous region of Vietnam. Accordingly, a DLNN structure with 192 neurons in 3 hidden layers was proposed to construct an inference model that predicts different levels of susceptibility to flash flood. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and the sigmoid were selected as the activate function and the transfer function, respectively, whereas the Adaptive moment estimation (Adam) was used to update and optimize the weights of the DLNN. A database for the study area, which includes factors of elevation, slope, curvature, aspect, stream density, NDVI, soil type, lithology, and rainfall, was established to train and validate the proposed model. Feature selection was carried out for these factors using the Information gain ratio. The results show that the DLNN attains a good prediction accuracy with Classification Accuracy Rate = 92.05%, Positive Predictive Value = 94.55% and Negative Predictive Value = 89.55%. Compared to benchmarks, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and Support Vector Machine, the DLNN performs better; therefore, it could be concluded that the proposed hybridization of GIS and deep learning can be a promising tool to assist the government authorities and involving parties in flash flood mitigation and land-use planning.",

This new flood extent forecasting model would allow valuable and easy to understand information be disseminated in a timely manner for flood preparation and flood response. The Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) method and AutoRoute method were considered for flood extent models but the HAND was the better option for its simple and quick computation as well as its viability on a global scale. Due to the importance of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) in these flood extent models, an analysis was performed on the sensitivity and response of different DEMs with the HAND method. The HAND method with the differing DEMs was also analyzed using the Streamflow Prediction Tool for model boundary conditions against Sentinel-1 SAR generated flood extent images from August 24, 2017. The MERIT DEM performed the best in this analysis and is recommended for future research in creating a global forecasting flood extent model. The HAND method covered about 25% of the generated flood extent images and more complex flood extent models may need to be considered in areas where HAND underperforms. Finally, a proof of concept flood extent model was created and deployed as a web application for easy accessibility and distribution of flood information. Additional research to consider is flood impact based on affected population or an economic analysis, as well as optimizing model parameters for increased accuracy and performance. Additional research is also needed for HAND DEM analysis in other parts of the world.",

Typically, uncertainties are investigated by comparing the effects of an ensemble of key model inputs, such as friction values and hydrographic uncertainties, on model outputs. In this study, an approach is adopted that also consider the uncertainty associated with the computational models. Using the LISFLOOD-FP code, which contains multiple methods for solving floodplain flow, two test cases with different hydraulic characteristics are used in a systematic uncertainty analysis. An ensemble of inputs including cell size, hydrological uncertainty, and representation of buildings are assessed for impact on modelling results. Results show the numerical complexity is a significant source of uncertainty in complex flow regimes, but this reduces in typical fluvial flood events. The method of assessing the modelling output is also found to be important in determining the overall influence of parameters.",

      "citations": 69,
      "abstract": "In this paper we attempt to produce a first hydrodynamic model of the middle reach of the Congo river system in order to understand what controls this river’s unique bimodal flood pulse. The model covers the area between Kisangani and Kinshasa on the main stem and includes the major tributaries and the Cuvette Centrale wetland, one of the world’s largest and most understudied lowland regions. A mixture of in-situ discharges and modelled discharge from a basin-wide catchment hydrology model were used to force a four-kilometre resolution hydrodynamic simulation developed using the LISFLOOD-FP model. River channels are represented as sub-grid scale features and their width is therefore decoupled from that of the over-lying floodplain grid. Unknown channel friction and bathymetry parameters were calibrated using ERS-2 and Envisat satellite altimetry measurements of channel water level. The calibrated model simulated channel water surface elevations across the domain with a bias and root mean square error of 0.185 and 0.842 m respectively. The value for root mean squared error is close to that obtained for comparisons of ERS-2 and Envisat satellite altimetry to in-situ water elevation data in similar basins (0.79 m and 0.47 m respectively). The model results imply that the bimodal annual pattern of Congo river discharge is predominantly a hydrological rather than hydraulically-controlled feature, with the channel-floodplain interactions and river constrictions having only a modest impact on the flood wave propagation. Nevertheless, and counter to current understanding, we find that interactions between channels and floodplains do however occur extensively, with over 2100 km of the 13,000 km of channel network in the model identified as zones where water is actively exchanged between channels and floodplains. Whilst the water volume that is exchanged with the floodplain is substantially less than for other large rivers, our results imply that channel-floodplain interactions are a significant feature of Congo flood wave propagation. Overall the model provides insights into the hydraulics of this understudied system that can next be tested both in the field and through more detailed modelling studies.",

      "abstract": "Floods are one of the most devastating types of disasters that cause loss of lives and property worldwide each year. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the prediction capability of the naïve Bayes tree (NBTree), alternating decision tree (ADTree), and random forest (RF) methods for the spatial prediction of flood occurrence in the Quannan area, China. A flood inventory map with 363 flood locations was produced and partitioned into training and validation datasets through random selection with a ratio of 70/30. The spatial flood database was constructed using thirteen flood explanatory factors. The probability certainty factor (PCF) method was used to analyze the correlation between the factors and flood occurrences. Consequently, three flood susceptibility maps were produced using the NBTree, ADTree, and RF methods. Finally, the area under the curve (AUC) and statistical measures were used to validate the flood susceptibility models. The results indicated that the RF method is an efficient and reliable model in flood susceptibility assessment, with the highest AUC values, positive predictive rate, negative predictive rate, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the training (0.951, 0.892, 0.941, 0.945, 0.886, and 0.915, respectively) and validation (0.925, 0.851, 0.938, 0.945, 0.835, and 0.890, respectively) datasets.",

      "abstract": "Floods are the most common natural disaster globally and lead to severe damage, especially in urban environments. This study evaluated the efficiency of a self-organizing map neural network (SOMN) algorithm for urban flood hazard mapping in the case of Amol city, Iran. First, a flood inventory database was prepared using field survey data covering 118 flooded points. A 70:30 data ratio was applied for training and validation purposes. Six factors (elevation, slope percent, distance from river, distance from channel, curve number, and precipitation) were selected as predictor variables. After building the model, the odds ratio skill score (ORSS), efficiency (E), true skill statistic (TSS), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) were used as evaluation metrics to scrutinize the goodness-of-fit and predictive performance of the model. The results indicated that the SOMN model performed excellently in modeling flood hazard in both the training (AUC = 0.946, E = 0.849, TSS = 0.716, ORSS = 0.954) and validation (AUC = 0.924, E = 0.857, TSS = 0.714, ORSS = 0.945) steps. The model identified around 23% of the Amol city area as being in high or very high flood risk classes that need to be carefully managed. Overall, the results demonstrate that the SOMN model can be used for flood hazard mapping in urban environments and can provide valuable insights about flood risk management.",

      "abstract": "Due to rapid urbanization and climate change, the frequency of flood events has notably increased over the last decades, adversely impacting societal development and economic growth. The recent years have seen growing interests in devising risk-based solutions to support flood management. The risk-based approach, which quantifies both flooding frequencies and impacts, offers opportunities to design cost-efficient strategies to address all segments of the risk management cycle. While theoretically well established, current methods to quantify flood risks usually fail to capture adequately spatial and temporal dynamics of flood risks. This work presents novel and enhanced flood risk assessment frameworks designed to address three limitations of existing flood risk estimation methods, including: (i) the influences of morpho-dynamics and dike failure on risks patterns, (ii) the spatial coherency of regional flood events, and (iii) future flood risk adaptation at the regional scale. The frameworks proposed rely on modelling chains, with several or all of the following components: (i) long-term continuous and spatially coherent forcing events, (ii) a probabilistic river channel model, (iii) a stochastic structure failure model, (iv) an efficient inundation modelling strategy, and (v) a probabilistic damage simulation model. The risk modelling frameworks, applied in Nepal and India, highlight the benefits of using more advanced methods to address the complexity of flood hazard and risks dynamics. The research work demonstrates that integrated risk modelling approaches are nowadays applicable and should be considered to better inform risk management strategies.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Research",
      "citations": 28,
      "abstract": "A novel modeling framework that simultaneously improves accuracy, predictability, and computational efficiency is presented. It embraces the benefits of three modeling techniques integrated together for the first time: surrogate modeling, parameter inference, and data assimilation. The use of polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) surrogates significantly decreases computational time. Parameter inference allows for model faster convergence, reduced uncertainty, and superior accuracy of simulated results. Ensemble Kalman filters assimilate errors that occur during forecasting. To examine the applicability and effectiveness of the integrated framework, we developed 18 approaches according to how surrogate models are constructed, what type of parameter distributions are used as model inputs, and whether model parameters are updated during the data assimilation procedure. We conclude that (1) PCE must be built over various forcing and flow conditions, and in contrast to previous studies, it does not need to be rebuilt at each time step; (2) model parameter specification that relies on constrained, posterior information of parameters (so‐called Selected specification) can significantly improve forecasting performance and reduce uncertainty bounds compared to Random specification using prior information of parameters; and (3) no substantial differences in results exist between single and dual ensemble Kalman filters, but the latter better simulates flood peaks. The use of PCE effectively compensates for the computational load added by the parameter inference and data assimilation (up to ~80 times faster). Therefore, the presented approach contributes to a shift in modeling paradigm arguing that complex, high‐fidelity hydrologic and hydraulic models should be increasingly adopted for real‐time and ensemble flood forecasting.",

      "citations": 17,
      "abstract": "Flood risk assessment is an important prerequisite for risk management decisions. To estimate the risk, i.e. the probability of damage, flood damage needs to be either systematically recorded over a long period or modelled for a series of synthetically generated flood events. Since damage records are typically rare, time series of plausible, spatially coherent event precipitation or peak discharges need to be generated to drive the chain of process models. In the present study, synthetic flood events are generated by two different approaches to modelling flood risk in a meso-scale alpine study area (Vorarlberg, Austria). The first approach is based on the semi-conditional multi-variate dependence model applied to discharge series. The second approach relies on the continuous hydrological modelling of synthetic meteorological fields generated by a multi-site weather generator and using an hourly disaggregation scheme. The results of the two approaches are compared in terms of simulated spatial patterns of peak discharges and overall flood risk estimates. It could be demonstrated that both methods are valid approaches for risk assessment with specific advantages and disadvantages. Both methods are superior to the traditional assumption of a uniform return period, where risk is computed by assuming a homogeneous return period (e.g. 100-year flood) across the entire study area.",

During this stage, the hydrological models assimilate soil moisture and hydro-meteorological observations to evaluate soil infiltration capacities at the beginning of the discharge forecast. Predicted discharges are converted to water-level forecasts using the hydraulic model Iber+, a GPU-parallelized bidimensional flow model. Hydraulic models also assimilate tidal-level forecasts in order to define the boundary conditions of the models. The performance of MERLIN was evaluated over 4 months at three coastal catchments of 4.95, 16.96, and 83.9 km 2 . Forecasted discharges and water levels presented a good fit to observed values, especially at the larger catchments, which confirmed the potential utility of the presented system.",

      "abstract": "Flood modelling is an important first step towards understanding and managing floods, at all spatial scales, from a large catchment of a river to  highly developed urban areas and to individual property and infrastructure. Recent advances in modelling techniques along with sophisticated computational tools and data products have facilitated a rapid progress in flood modelling. Despite this progress, an accurate assessment and forecasting of floods with the associated risk is still elusive due to uncertainties at each stage of the modelling. This paper presents a review of flood modelling with specific focus on India. In recent years, significant contributions have been made by Indian researchers to the hydrologic science in general, and to flood modelling in particular. Indian contributions to the areas of hydrologic modelling of floods, flood forecasting, flash flood modelling, urban floods, and risk assessment and mitigation are reviewed in the paper. Since the emphasis is on flood modelling, the related topics of flood frequency analysis are excluded, although some representative studies on extreme rainfall frequencies are briefly mentioned. The paper concludes with some perspectives on future directions in flood modelling and actions needed for sustainable flood management practices, in the country.",

      "abstract": "Changes in peak magnitude, volume, frequency and duration of floods obtained from a peak-over-threshold sampling in 780 unregulated catchments show significant differences between northern and southern Australia over 1975–2012. Increases of the flood properties are mainly located in northern Australia, while decreases are mostly in southern Australia. These changes could be dominated by inter-annual and/or decadal variability of floods. The multidimensional behaviors of flood change across Australia can be described by three distinct groups (i.e. no changes, increases and decreases in all flood properties), showing strong geographic cohesion. The geographical consistency between the changing patterns of flood properties and spatial patterns of vapor transport anomalies during the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) positive phase could partly explain the geographic cohesion of flood changes. In a warmer future, the observed decreases in floods in southern Australia are projected to continue with high model agreement, while only magnitude and volume of floods in northern Australia are projected to increase but with high uncertainties. The diametric changes in flood magnitude between northern and southern Australia are projected to be more evident in extreme (i.e. 50-year) floods than small (i.e. 5- and 20-year) floods.",

      "abstract": "Changes in flood regimes in Canada were examined using a large-scale dataset of hydrometric stations from across the country. Significant trends were analysed in time series of both Annual Maximum (AMAX) and Peaks-Over-Threshold (POT) series of streamflow data. POT series were extracted from daily flows for each watershed using a semi-automated threshold selection method. Since flood regimes are complex by nature, a multi-temporal and multifaceted approach was employed to identify and properly characterize the types of changes. Common time periods of the recent 30-, 40-, 50-, and 60-years were studied. Trends were investigated both in terms of flood magnitude and frequency of these time series. Changes were examined using different groupings of sites based on dominant hydro-climatic regions, drainage area size, and land-use changes based on hydrometric reference stations. Trends were examined both at local and field scale. Notably significant trends were identified in the Atlantic, Central, Prairie, and Northern regions. Additionally, Reference Hydrometric Basin Network (RHBN) watersheds were found to have more statistically significant trends than the non-RHBN sites. New Hydrological Insights An increased number of threshold exceeding events was observed from this analysis. Flow magnitudes series showed more increasing trends in the most recent time windows while there are more decreasing trends in longer time periods. Different types of changes were observed for different hydro-climatic regions.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 52,
      "abstract": "Understanding the generation mechanisms of floods is important to estimating future flood hazards by improving flood frequency analysis and flood trend interpretation. From the hydrological perspective of flood classification, flood types are determined by the seasonality or magnitudes of hydrological drivers (eg, rainfall, snowmelt, catchment wetness). Few studies attribute floods to the causative drivers by quantifying the contributions of each driver to the flood peaks. Therefore, we propose the Quantification of Driver Contributions for Flood Classification (QDC-FC) method, which combines a data-driven hydrological model, the Shapley value, which quantifies driver contributions to flood peaks, and a classification tree for dividing floods into five types: long-rain floods (> 1 day), rain-on-snow floods, snowmelt floods, short-rain floods (≤ 1 day), and antecedent-wet floods. In the Eastern Monsoon Region (EMR) of China, the method is applied in 225 catchments where the data-driven model has high Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE> 0.6) in daily runoff simulation and a high R-squared value (R 2> 0.6) in flood peak simulation. Under the impact of the eastern monsoon, short-rain floods and long-rain floods are the most frequent types in 143 and 69 catchments, respectively. In 213 catchments, all extreme floods (with return periods larger than 10 years) are caused by short rain or long rain. Antecedent wetness causes more than 20% of floods in 26 out of 66 catchments in northeastern China and northern China with cumulative catchment wetness in summer. Although snowmelt-induced floods occur in April in some catchments of northeastern China, only one catchment has more than 20% of floods caused by snowmelt. As a new method for flood classification, the QDC-FC sheds light on the mixed generation mechanisms of floods and possible drivers of flood trends in the EMR of China.",

      "abstract": "As atmospheric moisture capacity is highly sensitive to rising temperatures, precipitation extremes are widely projected to intensify with a warming climate and thus altering the flooding generation regime. Previous works seldomly focused on bivariate flood quantiles under climate change at a national scale, and fewer flooding projections quantified the estimation uncertainty sourced from sample size limitation. This study systematically investigates the changes in bivariate quantiles of flood peak and volume with incorporation of sampling uncertainty for 151 catchments over China, with climate trajectories projected by a set of multi-model ensemble under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5. After correcting the systematical biases of eight CMIP5 GCM outputs, four state-of-the-art hydrological models are driven and validated for each catchment, and the best-simulation model is selected to project future streamflow scenarios. The copula function is employed to construct the joint distribution of flood peak and volume, and then the most likely realizations of bivariate quantiles are derived under different Joint Return Periods (JRPs), with the uncertainty envelope quantified with the area of 90% confidence ellipse by a copula-based parametric bootstrapping uncertainty (C-PBU) approach. Our results project an overall ascending trend of temperature and precipitation over China, and the bivariate flood quantiles and corresponding estimation uncertainty of most catchments in the future period (2056–2100) are much larger than the baseline (1961–2005), despite accompanied by substantial climate model uncertainty and spatial variability in magnitude. Many basins would be subjected to a dramatic increase of flood magnitude by over 50%, while only few basins are projected to experience a decreasing flood risk, suggesting an urgent need to increase societal resilience to a warming climate over China.",

Study focus Bias-corrected EURO-CORDEX RCM output for RCP 8.5 is used to generate an ensemble of 500 hydrological simulations for assessing changes in flood magnitudes under a future climate. Flood estimates are based on three extreme value distributions (EVDs), Gumbel, Generalised Extreme Value and Generalised Pareto, with confidence intervals calculated using parametric bootstrapping, and uncertainty introduced into the ensemble by the flood estimation is evaluated using variance decomposition. Changes in EVD parameters under future conditions are also assessed. New hydrologic insight for the region There are large differences in projected changes between catchments, with median estimates ranging from −48 % to +99 % for the 200 year flood. Flood magnitudes in all catchments with rainfall-dominant or mixed flood regimes are expected to increase. EVDs with a shape parameter (GEV and GPD) indicate larger increases in higher flood quantiles than the Gumbel distribution ( e.g . by 5–8 percentage points for the 200 year flood). Flood frequency estimation contributes 30–52 % of the total ensemble range in individual catchments. Location and scale parameters generally increase in catchments with increasing flood magnitudes, and some catchments with mixed flood regimes also exhibit increases in the shape parameter under future conditions.",

      "journal": "Science of the Total Environment",
      "citations": 33,
      "abstract": "Flood risk can be reduced at various stages of the disaster management cycle. Traditionally, permanent infrastructure is used for flood prevention, while residual risk is managed with emergency measures that are triggered by forecasts. Advances in flood forecasting hold promise for a more prominent role to forecast-based measures. In this study, we present a methodology that compares permanent with forecast-based flood-prevention measures. On the basis of this methodology, we demonstrate how operational decision-makers can select between acting against frequent low-impact, and rare high-impact events. Through a hypothetical example, we describe a number of decision scenarios using flood risk indicators for Chikwawa, Malawi, and modelled and forecasted discharge data from 1997 to 2018. The results indicate that the choice between permanent and temporary measures is affected by the cost of measures, climatological flood risk, and forecast ability to produce accurate flood warnings. Temporary measures are likely to be more cost-effective than permanent measures when the probability of flooding is low. Furthermore, a combination of the two types of measures can be the most cost-effective solution, particularly when the forecast is more skillful in capturing low-frequency events. Finally, we show that action against frequent low-impact events could more cost-effective than action against rare high-impact ones. We conclude that forecast-based measures could be used as an alternative to some of the permanent measures rather than being used only to cover the residual risk, and thus, should be taken into consideration when identifying the optimal flood risk strategy.",

      "citations": 2,
      "abstract": "Low-water crossings are structures designed to be overtopped during high river flows. These structures are usually constructed in remote locations, making timely emergency response difficult in case of flooding. In this work, five historical flooding events were hindcasted at a remote low-water crossing in central Texas. An ensemble of model-simulated precipitation forcing cascades uncertainty through hydrologic and hydraulic models. Each precipitation ensemble member corresponds to an independent model run, resulting in an ensemble 24-h streamflow forecast initialized at 0000 UTC. In addition to the hydrologic conditions, the forecast is expanded to predict river hydraulics, through flow velocity and depth. Analysis of the five hindcast events indicates that cascading probabilistic precipitation through hydrologic and hydraulic models adds robustness to river forecasts compared to deterministic methods. The approach provides a means to communicate the uncertainty of predictions through the ensemble spread. Analysis of deterministic hazard thresholds suggest that a hydraulic stability threshold, calculated as the multiplication of flow velocity and depth, is a useful alternative approach to NWS high-water categories for communicating hydrologic/hydraulic risk, as well as associated model uncertainty in the simplest manner possible.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 44,
      "abstract": "Artificial neural network has been acknowledged as a promising tool for accurately forecasting the streamflow. However, several constraints limit its application in operational hydrology; the primary one being, the non-availability (practically not available) of observed streamflow to be used as input to the model. In addition, progressive reduction in forecast accuracy along with an increase in forecast lead time makes the ANN model less amenable for operational flood forecasting. This study proposes a hybrid model (M4) that combines the strength of a physically-based distributed hydrological model and a data-driven model (ANN), which purges the above concerns. The proposed model was tested using two different case studies (ST-I and ST-II), with respective time steps as fifteen minutes and one day. While the first case study demonstrated the application of the model on a real-time streamflow forecasting scenario, the second one represented a continuous streamflow simulation. The performance of the hybrid model was evaluated, and the results showed that the proposed hybrid model (M4) performed reasonably well at higher lead times (NSE= 0.91 for ST-I and 0.77 for ST-II at time step't+ 4'). The proposed model (M4), was further tested for its ability to work with forecasted rainfall (synthetically generated), using the data of ST-I and the model performed well with NSE of 0.95. Though the performance of the models was drawn only up to't+ 4', it was illustrated that the proposed hybrid model could be used to generate forecasted streamflow hydrograph corresponding to a full flood event well in advance. This characteristic of the proposed model enhances its utility in operational flood forecasting.",

      "abstract": "Bangladesh and India are in a long-standing conflict with regard to the sharing of hydro-meteorological information of the Brahamaputra River. Consequently, it limits flood risk management in Bangladesh (the downstream country). Recently developed water resources reanalysis data appear as a promising alternative in providing this information. Further evaluation of these global datasets is needed to understand their capabilities to improve flood events estimation. In this study, the potential of the global water resources reanalysis (WRR) developed within the EU-FP7 project eartH2Observe is critically assessed for detecting and estimating flood events in the Brahmaputra River basin for 1980 to 2012 period. The discharge time series of five large-scale models available in the WRR dataset and two multi-model combinations are evaluated at different temporal resolutions and their performance is compared with a local-scale hydrological model. In situ data and reported damaging flood events compiled from two global disaster databases are used as benchmarks in flood events evaluation. Results show that the WRR data have reasonable skill in detecting flood events, though a significant underestimation of magnitude is found. This study also reveals that the individual large-scale models simulate peak flows similarly or even better than the local-scale model, capturing the hydrological behaviour in the basin and identifying the occurrence and severity of both observed and reported damaging flood events. In conclusion, this study gives insights in the applicability of global hydrological models and datasets for estimating flood events at a local-scale for transboundary rivers in water-sharing countries.",

This article presents a novel approach to collating receptor datasets into a pre-calculated Impact Library for use in a Hazard Impact Model (HIM) that will operate using real-time probabilistic rainfall and surface runoff forecasts for England and Wales. The HIM provides an approach suitable for modelling flood impacts. Initial results are presented for a case study covering the 2012 floods in the North East of England. Information generated by the HIM provides additional benefits beyond current methods. Features include operator access to 1 km 15 min spatial-temporal data, analysis of individual impact criteria and modular refinement of the Impact Library to suit different situations.

For flash floods monitoring, a sub-daily simulation is critical to properly address the response of the watershed and prepare timely flash flood warnings. Over the last years, the city of Tumbes has been affected by the overflowing of Puyango-Tumbes river, which is born in Ecuador and flows to northwestern Peru. For this reason, the aim of this work is to develop an operational sub-daily hydrological forecast service for Puyango-Tumbes river basin.To establish this forecasting system, we performed a continuous hydrological modelling approach on an hourly time scale for the Puyango-Tumbes basin at El Tigre stream gauge (4710 km2) in a semi-distributed way. We used the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model to simulate rainfall-runoff process and Saint-Venant equations for flow routing. Gridded hourly precipitation (~10 Km) was obtained by merging satellite-based precipitation estimates (IMERG-Early Run and GSMaP Near-Real-Time products) with rain-gauge data applying a simple bias adjustment. The model was calibrated and validated for the 2014/15 - 2018/19 period. Results show good agreement between observed and simulated hydrographs with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) between 0.6 and 0.8, for both products. For the highest floods, the peak is reasonably reached although there is an underestimation of 22% and 38% for calibration and validation period. The best performance was obtained for the SAC-SMA-IMERG scheme; however, sometimes rainfall at the upper Puyango-Tumbes is not well represented.The flood forecasting operation will be performed on a daily-basis using an hourly meteorological forecast from ETA-SENAMHI climate model, at ~10 Km resolution. During this austral summer, the system will be evaluated and distributed to stakeholders.",

In this context, the Miño River Flood Alert System (MIDAS) early warning system has been developed for the Miño River (Galicia, NW Spain), whose flood events have historically caused severe damage in urban areas and are expected to increase in intensity in the next decades. MIDAS is integrated by a hydrologic (HEC-HMS) and a hydraulic (Iber+) model using precipitation forecast as input data. The system runs automatically and is governed by a set of Python scripts. When any hazard is detected, an alert is issued by the system, including detailed hazards maps, to help decision makers to take precise and effective mitigation measures. Statistical analysis supports the accuracy of hydrologic and hydraulic modules implemented to forecast river flow and flooded critical areas during the analyzed period of time, including some of the most extreme events registered in the Miño River. In fact, MIDAS has proven to be capable of predicting most of the alert situations occurred during the study period, showing its capability to anticipate risk situations.",

      "abstract": "The persistence over space and time of flash flood disasters – flash floods that have caused either economical or life losses, or both – is a diagnostic measure of areas subjected to hydrological risk. The concept of persistence can be assessed via clustering analyses, performed here to analyse the national inventory of flash flood disasters in China occurred in the period 1950–2015. Specifically, we investigated the spatiotemporal pattern distribution of the flash flood disasters and their clustering behavior by using both global and local methods: the first, based on the Ripley's K-function, and the second on Scan Statistics. As a result, we could visualize patterns of aggregated events, estimate the cluster duration and make assumptions about their evolution over time, also with respect precipitation trend. Due to the large spatial (the whole Chinese territory) and temporal (66 years) scale of the dataset, we were able to capture whether certain clusters gather in specific locations and times, but also whether their magnitude tends to increase or decrease. Overall, the eastern regions in China are much more subjected to flash flood disasters compared to the rest of the country. Detected clusters revealed that these phenomena predominantly occur between July and October, a period coinciding with the wet season in China. The number of detected clusters increases with time, but the associated duration drastically decreases in the recent period. This may indicate a change towards triggering mechanisms which are typical of short-duration extreme rainfall events. Finally, being flash flood disasters directly linked to precipitation and their extreme realization, we indirectly assessed whether the magnitude of the trigger itself has also varied through space and time, enabling considerations in the context of climatic changes.",

For that purpose, some meteorological parameters, physical-geographical factors and the flood events data were studied for the 1994–2019 period. The linear trends demonstrate an increasing tendency of air temperature and precipitation. Those trends expressed increased flood occurrences, especially for the 2000s, whereas the Mann–Kendall (MK) trend test reveals no significant change. The number of flood events reaches its maximum in 2011 with its peak in May. Out of 191 flood events, half of the occurrences are recorded in the flat areas and southern aspects of the mountains (22% of the country's territory). There is a certain clustering of flood events in the areas with up to 5° slopes (66% of flood events). The most flood vulnerable areas were analyzed and mapped via Geographical Information System (GIS). The GIS-based mapping shows the location of flood vulnerable areas in the central, northern parts of the country, and the coastal areas of Lake Sevan. Our methodological approach elaborates the localization of flood-prone sites. It can be used for the flood hazard assessment mapping and risk management.",

Frequent flooding, one of the extremes, needs to be analyzed while considering climate change to mitigate flood risk. This study forecast streamflow and evaluate risk of flooding in the Neuse River, North Carolina considering future climatic scenarios, and comparing them with an existing Federal Emergency Management Agency study. The cumulative distribution function transformation method was adopted for bias correction to reduce the uncertainty present in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) streamflow data. To calculate 100-year and 500-year flood discharges, the Generalized Extreme Value (L-Moment) was utilized on bias-corrected multimodel ensemble data with different climate projections. Out of all projections, shared socio-economic pathways (SSP5-8.5) exhibited the maximum design streamflow, which was routed through a hydraulic model, the Hydrological Engineering Center’s River Analysis System (HEC-RAS), to generate flood inundation and risk maps. The result indicates an increase in flood inundation extent compared to the existing study, depicting a higher flood hazard and risk in the future. This study highlights the importance of forecasting future flood risk and utilizing the projected climate data to obtain essential information to determine effective strategic plans for future floodplain management.",

Therefore, in this study, we developed an integrated flood forecasting and warning system combined inland-river that systematized technology to quantify flood risk and flood forecasting in urban areas. LSTM was used to predict the stream depth in the short-term inundation prediction. Moreover, rainfall prediction by radar data, a rainfall-runoff model combined inland-river by coupled SWMM and HEC-RAS, automatic simplification module of drainage networks, automatic calibration module of SWMM parameter by Dynamically Dimensioned Search (DDS) algorithm, and 2-dimension inundation database were used in very short-term inundation prediction to warn and convey the flood-related data and information to communities. The proposed system presented better forecasting results compared to the Seoul integrated disaster prevention system. It can provide an accurate water level for 30 min to 90 min lead times in the short-term inundation prediction module. And the very short-term inundation prediction module can provide water level across a stream for 10 min to 60 min lead times using forecasting rainfall by radar as well as inundation risk areas. In conclusion, the proposed modules were expected to be useful to support inundation forecasting and warning systems.",

      "journal": "Advances in Water Resources",
      "citations": 18,
      "abstract": "Non-structural mitigation measures to the globally increasing flood events include forecast based alert generation. However, the extreme rainfall forecasts are associated with low hit rate, high false alarm, and spatiotemporal bias; which makes it difficult to rely on them. Further, the losses due to flood in a region not only depend on rainfall severity but also on topography, socioeconomic conditions and exposure of the region to floods. Here, we introduce a new concept of spatial flood risk mapping and forecasting at weather to medium range based on forecasted hazard, embedded with vulnerability (topographic and socioeconomic) and exposure information. We define hazard as the probability of extreme rainfall event during upcoming days given an available weather forecast for the same days. As hindcast is used for computation of probabilities, hazard contains prior information about the false alarm, hit rate and spatiotemporal bias of the forecast. Vulnerability is calculated by averaging the topographic and socioeconomic indicators, and exposure is calculated using a land use land cover map. Topographic vulnerability is computed with digital elevation model using Height Above the Nearest Drainage method, and Data Envelopment Analysis is performed to derive the socioeconomic vulnerability based on the demographic census data. For a specific region and a specific event, the relative flood risk maps are generated at an administrative level (e.g., district, subdistrict or village level for India) and the high-risk areas can be identified from those maps for mitigation. The methodology is demonstrated for a very recent extremely severe flood event that happened in Kerala, India in August 2018. It is evident from the results that the high-risk areas forecasted well in advance (as high lead time as 15 days) match fairly well with the areas, which suffered maximum losses because of direct flood.",

This study aims to assess the suitability of the near-real-time “Early” run and “Late” run of the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) products (IMERG-E and IMERG-L), and the post-real-time “Final” run IMERG product (IMERG-F) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42RT in flood simulation, particularly flood events, at hourly scale over a humid region of China. A statistical assessment of the accuracy of selected satellite-based precipitation products shows IMERG-F outperforms the others, and the performance of TMPA 3B42RT is generally better than that of IMERG-E and IMERG-L. Furthermore, IMERG-F performs the best in hourly streamflow simulation, as well as in flood event simulation, with a mean Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0.71, while IMERG-E, IMERG-L and TMPA 3B42RT present overall acceptable performance. The simulated peak flows tend to be smaller than the observations, and the simulated time lags of occurrence are changeable. This study finds that IMERG and Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) are suitable for hydrological simulations at hourly scale, and IMERG-E is an appropriate replacement for TMPA 3B42RT in this case.",

      "abstract": "Climatic change alters the frequency and intensity of natural hazards. In order to assess potential future changes in flood seasonality in the Rhine River basin, we analyse changes in streamflow, snowmelt, precipitation and evapotranspiration at 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 ∘C global warming levels. The mesoscale hydrological model (mHM) forced with an ensemble of climate projection scenarios (five general circulation models under three representative concentration pathways) is used to simulate the present and future climate conditions of both pluvial and nival hydrological regimes.Our results indicate that future changes in flood characteristics in the Rhine River basin are controlled by increases in antecedent precipitation and diminishing snowpacks. In the pluvial-type sub-basin of the Moselle River, an increasing flood potential due to increased antecedent precipitation encounters declining snowpacks during winter. The decrease in snowmelt seems to counterbalance increasing precipitation, resulting in only small and transient changes in streamflow maxima. For the Rhine Basin at Basel, rising temperatures cause changes from solid to liquid precipitation, which enhance the overall increase in precipitation sums, particularly in the cold season. At the gauge at Basel, the strongest increases in streamflow maxima show up during winter, when strong increases in liquid precipitation encounter almost unchanged snowmelt-driven runoff. The analysis of snowmelt events for the gauge at Basel suggests that at no point in time during the snowmelt season does a warming climate result in an increase in the risk of snowmelt-driven flooding. Snowpacks are increasingly depleted with the course of the snowmelt season. We do not find indications of a transient merging of pluvial and nival floods due to climate warming. To refine attained results, next steps need to be the representation of glaciers and lakes in the model set-up, the coupling of simulations to a streamflow component model and an independent validation of the snow routine using satellite-based snow cover maps.",

      "abstract": "Decreasing flood damages in a basin and achieving sustainable development reveal the necessity of integrated management of flood. Integrated flood management requires the co-implementation of both structural and non-structural flood mitigation strategies. Watershed management, building dams and levees, and increasing channel capacity are considered among structural measures. While, flood forecasting, developing flood early warning systems, and establishing reservoir operation rules can fall into the non-structural measures group. The main goal of this study is to reveal the importance of co-implementation of structural and non-structural measures for managing the flood in the whole system. Structural measures are divided here into two main groups (1) dams and (2) watershed management, and non-structural measures focus more on reoperation of the system of reservoirs. The system dynamics (SD) approach has been used to model the integration of a series of structural and non-structural flood control measures for the Karkheh Basin, Iran. The performance of the developed model is evaluated based on historical floods, including the recent 2019 flooding event in this basin, and the performance of flood mitigation strategies is evaluated facing these flood events. Results indicate that both structural and non-structural solutions should be considered in flood management portfolios simultaneously, and none solely can be the silver bullet. The magnitude of a 200-year flood can be reduced from 7956 to 3021 m 3 /s, if integrated structural and non-structural strategies would be considered in Karkheh Basin. This study identifies the key role of structural and non-structural measures for integrated flood management in Karkheh Basin, which and provides effective information for appropriate and timely operation and decision making in the future.",

We further developed a graphical user interface (GUI) and toolbox for this procedure in MATLAB.

      "abstract": "Africa is severely affected by floods, with an increasing vulnerability to these events in the most recent decades. Our improved preparation against and response to this hazard would benefit from an enhanced understanding of the physical processes at play. Here, a database of 399 African stream gauges is used to analyze the seasonality of observed annual maximum flood, precipitation and soil moisture between 1981 and 2018. The database includes a total of 11,302 flood events, covering most African regions. The analysis is based on directional statistics to compare the annual maximum river flood with annual maximum rainfall and soil moisture. The results show that the annual maximum flood in most areas is more strongly linked to the annual peak of soil moisture than of annual maximum precipitation. In addition, the interannual variability of flood magnitudes is better explained by the variability of annual maximum soil moisture than by the variability in the annual maximum precipitation. These results have important implications for flood forecasting and the analysis of the long‐term evolution of these hydrological hazards in relation with their drivers.",

      "abstract": "The impact of monsoon on rainfall in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin (LMRB) has been well understood, but its impact on flood characteristic across the basin is still unclear. To investigate this impact, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model was used to generate the basin-wide discharge and extract flood characteristics. Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM), Western North Pacific Monsoon (WNPM), and their combined effect (ISWN) were considered and represented by monsoon index. The monsoon impact area was firstly obtained based on the monsoon impact on rainfall, followed by the anomaly analyses of flood characteristics within the impact area to quantify the monsoon impact on floods at local and spatial scales. The results show that the ISM and WNPM (or ISWN) can significantly modulate up to 20% of the rainfall interannual variability in the western and eastern parts of the basin, respectively. The monsoon impact on flood is regionally distributed with impact in tributary larger than mainstream. Over half of the monsoon impact areas show the flood start date averagely advances (delays) 8–12 days, flood volume averagely increases (decreases) by 9%–17.5% and Q 10 averagely increases (decreases) by 7.4%–14.4% during the strong (weak) monsoon years. Also, the comparisons between monsoon local and spatial impacts reveal that the trade-off of water from different areas can disturb the monsoon impact on flood, suggesting that more stations should be used when using the observed data to analyze the monsoon impact. More importantly, the ISM tends to cause the severe flood in northern Thailand, while WNPM and ISWN mainly induce the severe flood in the southeastern part of the LMRB. This study could help to increase the knowledge of the impact of climate change on flood and help with the regional flood managements.",

      "citations": 23,
      "abstract": "Many studies investigate river floods by analyzing annual maximum series that record the largest flow of each year, including many within‐bank events inconsequential for human communities. Fewer focus on larger floods, especially at the continental scale. Using 473 streamgages across the conterminous United States with near‐natural flow from 1966 to 2015, we characterized the seasonality, occurrence, and climatic associations of the 10 largest and 2 largest floods at each site. These are often overbank events that have ecosystem functions and pose risks to humans. We grouped sites into 14 clusters corresponding to climatic and physiographic regions and characterized their flood seasonality at a monthly resolution using a probabilistic method. We then evaluated annual occurrence regionally and nationally, and seasonal occurrence regionally, by complementing a traditional approach to trend analyses with a novel method based on expected occurrence. Relationships between flood occurrence and climate indices were also investigated. Large floods have strong seasonality in some regions, but in areas with numerous flood‐generating mechanisms, seasonality is more complex. There is little evidence nationally that large riverine floods are more or less frequent than expected in recent years and only two regions show significant trends in annual counts; few show seasonal trends. We found some regional relationships between flood counts and climate indices, annually and seasonally; nationally the Pacific North American pattern is related to annual counts of the 2 largest floods. Large‐flood occurrence was generally stable across the United States in the last five decades; this may or may not continue with projected warming.",

      "citations": 15,
      "abstract": "Simple models continue to be important for continental‐scale floodwater depth mapping due to the prohibitively expensive cost of calibrating and applying hydrodynamic models. This paper investigates the accuracy of three simple models for floodwater depth estimation from remote sensing derived water extent and/or Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) in semiarid regions. The three models are Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND; Nobre et al., 2011, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.03.051), Teng Vaze Dutta (TVD; Teng et al., 2013, http://hdl.handle.net/102.100.100/97033?index=1), and Floodwater Depth Estimation Tool (FwDET; Cohen, Brakenridge, et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12609). The model accuracy and nature of errors are established using industry's best practice hydrodynamic models as benchmarks in three regions in eastern Australia. The overall results show that FwDET tends to underestimate (by 0.32 m at 50th percentile) while HAND and TVD overestimate floodwater depth for almost all floods (by 0.97 and 0.98 m, respectively). We quantify how switching DEM from 5 m LiDAR to national or global data sets DEM‐H (Gallant et al., 2011, https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/72759), MERIT (Yamazaki et al., 2019, https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR024873), or FABDEM (Hawker et al., 2022, https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac4d4f) can affect different models differently; and we evaluate model performance against reach geomorphology and magnitude of flood events. The findings emphasize the importance of choosing a model that is fit for the intended application. By describing the applicability, advantages, and limitations of these models, this paper assists practitioners to choose the most appropriate model based on characteristics of their study area, type of problems they try to solve, and data availability.",

      "abstract": "With climate change, decreases in winter snow storage and increases in precipitation duration and intensities will alter the occurrence of floods in high-latitude countries. The state-of-the-art hydrological climate-impact model chain consists of one or more global climate models, downscaling and bias-correction techniques, and one or more hydrological models. Machine learning offers a complementary approach to hydrological climate-impact modelling by facilitating direct downscaling from large-scale atmospheric variables to streamflow. This paper presents the development of multilayer perceptron (MLP) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks benchmarked against regression tree models for reconstruction of daily streamflow and floods from atmospheric reanalysis data with comparable resolution to global climate model outputs. Catchment-specific, physically-based input features representing the dominant flood drivers were identified for 27 catchments in Norway. Overall, the LSTM obtained the highest accuracy. This article provides a springboard for future research on hydrological climate-impact modelling with neural networks in high-latitude countries.",

Cities adjacent to flood-prone areas in the last decades have played a major role in increasing the potential adverse effects of flood damage. This research study aims to evaluate and mitigate the risks of flood events in the El Bayadh region, which suffers from poor infrastructure and drained networks. To achieve this, it is necessary to evaluate rainfall intensities and their limits for durations from 0.167 to 24 h with return periods from 2 to 1000 years. Eight different frequency analysis distributions were fit to the historical rainfall data series over 43 years (1970–2012) using hypothesis-based goodness tests and information-based criteria. The most appropriate distributions were used to develop the rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) and flood risk-duration-frequency (RDF) curves for the study area. The results show that high-intensity rainfall values last for short durations, while high flood risk values last for intermediate durations. The results of the flood RDF curves can provide useful information for policy makers to make the right decisions regarding the effectiveness of the region’s protection structures against future flood risks.",

However, it is still a challenge to operationalise and quantify resilience. This study proposes a framework for assessing resilience to disasters based on the relationship between disaster intensity and damage rate. We use intense (short-term heavy) rainfall-induced urban flooding in Shenzhen city, one of the largest cities in China, as an example to explore the main features and transferability of the proposed resilience assessment framework. In addition, we demonstrate the usability of the proposed framework by using it to assess and compare the effectiveness of two resilience-building strategies: (1) permeable pavement transformation and (2) land vulnerability reduction. This research makes an innovative contribution through its effective disaster-damage-based approach for quantitatively evaluating urban resilience to disasters, which can support building resilience and mitigating the impact of climate change.",

      "journal": "Earth's Future",
      "citations": 12,
      "abstract": "Flooding is one of the most devastating natural disasters causing significant economic losses. One of the dominant drivers of flood losses is heavy precipitation, with other contributing factors such as built environments and socio-economic conditions superimposed to it. To better understand the risk profile associated with this hazard, we develop probabilistic models to quantify the future likelihood of fluvial flood-related property damage exceeding a critical threshold (i.e., high property damage) at the state level across the conterminous United States. The model is conditioned on indicators representing heavy precipitation amount and frequency derived from observed and downscaled precipitation. The likelihood of high property damage is estimated from the conditional probability distribution of annual total property damage, which is derived from the joint probability of the property damage and heavy precipitation indicators. Our results indicate an increase in the probability of high property damage (i.e., exceedance of 70th percentile of observed annual property damage for each state) in the future. Higher probability of high property damage is projected to be clustered in the states across the western and south-western United States, and parts of the U.S. Northwest and the northern Rockies and Plains. Depending on the state, the mean annual probability of high property damage in these regions could range from 38% to 80% and from 46% to 95% at the end of the century (2090s) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. This is equivalent to 20%-40% increase in the probability compared to the historical period 1996-2005. Results show that uncertainty in the projected probability of high property damage ranges from 14% to 35% across the states. The spatio-temporal variability of the uncertainty across the states and three future decades (i.e., 2050s, 2070s, and 2090s) exhibits nonstationarity, which is driven by the uncertainty associated with the probabilistic prediction models and climate change scenarios.",

Still, the multivariate nature of floods and droughts is often ignored by studying individual characteristics only, which can lead to the under- or overestimation of risk. Studying multivariate extremes is challenging because of variable dependencies and because they are even less abundant in observational records than univariate extremes. In this review, I discuss different types of multivariate hydrological extremes and their dependencies, including regional extremes affecting multiple locations, such as spatially connected flood events; consecutive extremes occurring in close temporal succession, such as successive droughts; extremes characterized by multiple characteristics, such as floods with jointly high peak discharge and flood volume; and transitions between different types of extremes, such as drought-to-flood transitions. I present different strategies to describe and model multivariate extremes and to assess their hazard potential, including descriptors of multivariate extremes, multivariate distributions and return periods, and stochastic and large-ensemble simulation approaches. The strategies discussed enable a multivariate perspective on hydrological extremes, which allows us to derive risk estimates for extreme events described by more than one variable.",

      "abstract": "Climate change and rapid urbanization have exacerbated the occurrence and impact of floods. It is essential to carry out a quantitative flood risk assessment and manage the flood risk before a disaster occurs. This article presents a combined riverine flood risk model to obtain the exceedance probability loss (EPL) curve and expected annual damage (EAD) under the current climate. This model includes a rapid flood model and a flood damage model. It aims to simulate the flood risk and evaluate the flood damage at 10-, 30-, 50-, 100-, and 200-year return period events. The results show that: (1) The total inundation areas will sharply increase when the flood return periods are over 30 years. (2) The EAD is 1,476 million dollars in the Jiulong River Basin (JRB). When the flood return period is over 30 years, the total damage increases sharply. (3) The flood risk in the lower reaches of the JRB is higher than in the upper reaches when the flood event is beyond a 20-year return period. (4) Industrial sector damage is the largest, followed by tertiary industry, transportation, construction, agriculture, and infrastructure. The combined model chain can quickly assess the flood risk in the river basin and judge the flood risk in a watershed compared to the national level. In addition, it can be applied to other river basins, and it will provide actionable information for future flood risk management.",

      "abstract": "Flood damage arises from complex interactions between flooding processes and socio‐economic elements. Damage assessments for elements such as residential buildings rely on a modelled representation of local damage factors. Multivariable model approaches are well suited for damage prediction using detailed information on flood hazard and building characteristics. While broad explanatory variable ranges can improve model prediction performance, model transfer across geographical contexts often causes performance loss. This study aims to determine if increasing explanatory damage variables in a multivariable model improves residential building damage prediction and whether models based on local variables transfer between locations. We used empirical damage observations from six flood events to train and evaluate random forest regression model prediction performance. Spatial transfer is tested by splitting event datasets with trained models applied to original and external events. Variable analysis demonstrates model performance improvement with up to seven flood hazard and building characteristics, decreasing thereafter. Event models showed highest prediction precision for the original event, while models trained on all events transfer with comparable predictions for urban stormwater flooding. Prediction precision reduces when models transfer between locations affected by different flood types. This indicates flood damage models must replicate variability in local damage factors for reliable spatial transfer.",

      "journal": "Hydrology and Earth System Sciences",

      "abstract": "Floods are a major natural hazard in the Mediterranean region, causing deaths and extensive damages. Recent studies have shown that intense rainfall events are becoming more extreme in this region but, paradoxically, without leading to an increase in the severity of floods. Consequently, it is important to understand how flood events are changing to explain this absence of trends in flood magnitude despite increased rainfall extremes. A database of 98 stations in southern France with an average record of 50 years of daily river discharge data between 1959 and 2021 was considered, together with a high-resolution reanalysis product providing precipitation and simulated soil moisture and a classification of weather patterns associated with rainfall events over France. Flood events, corresponding to an average occurrence of 1 event per year (5317 events in total), were extracted and classified into excess-rainfall, short-rainfall, and long-rainfall event types. Several flood event characteristics have been also analyzed: flood event durations, base flow contribution to floods, runoff coefficient, total and maximum event rainfall, and antecedent soil moisture. The evolution through time of these flood event characteristics and seasonality was analyzed. Results indicated that, in most basins, floods tend to occur earlier during the year, the mean flood date being, on average, advanced by 1 month between 1959–1990 and 1991–2021. This seasonal shift could be attributed to the increased frequency of southern-circulation weather types during spring and summer. An increase in total and extreme-event precipitation has been observed, associated with a decrease of antecedent soil moisture before rainfall events. The majority of flood events are associated with excess rainfall on saturated soils, but their relative proportion is decreasing over time, notably in spring, with a concurrent increased frequency of short rain floods. For most basins there is a positive correlation between antecedent soil moisture and flood event runoff coefficients that is remaining stable over time, with dryer soils producing less runoff and a lower contribution of base flow to floods. In a context of increasing aridity, this relationship is the likely cause of the absence of trends in flood magnitudes observed in this region and the change of event types. These changes in flood characteristics are quite homogeneous over the domain studied, suggesting that they are rather linked to the evolution of the regional climate than to catchment characteristics. Consequently, this study shows that even in the absence of trends, flood properties may change over time, and these changes need to be accounted for when analyzing the long-term evolution of flood hazards.",

      "journal": "Environmental Research Letters",
      "citations": 5,
      "abstract": "Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to flood hazards, and its flood risk is projected to increase with global warming. In addition to climate change, internal climate variation, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), influences flooding in many rivers worldwide. However, the impact of internal climate variability on flooding in Bangladesh remains unclear due to the limited observations. Here, we assess the impacts of ENSO and climate change on flood occurrence in Bangladesh using a large-ensemble climate simulation dataset and a global river model (CaMa-Flood). After separating 6000 years of simulation (100-member ensemble river simulations for 1950–2010) into El Niño, La Niña, and neutral years, we calculated the extent to which each ENSO stage increased flood occurrence probability relative to the neutral state using the fraction of attributable risk method. In addition, we estimated the impact of historical climate change on past flood occurrence through a comparison of simulations with and without historical global warming. Under the no-global-warming climate, La Niña increased the occurrence probability of a 10 year return period flood at Hardinge Bridge on the Ganges River by 38% compared to neutral years. The influence of La Niña or El Niño state on flood occurrence probability in the Brahmaputra River at Bahadurabad station is negligible. Historical global warming increased the occurrence of flooding in the Ganges River, the Brahmaputra River, and their confluence by 59%, 44%, and 55%, respectively. The impact of ENSO on flood occurrence probability decreased in the historical simulation, likely due to the conflation of ENSO and climate change signals, and no significant correlation between ENSO and flood occurrence was detected when only small-ensemble simulations were used. These findings suggest that the use of large-ensemble climate simulation datasets is essential for precise attribution of the impacts of internal climate variability on flooding in Bangladesh.",

      "abstract": "Understanding spatially correlated floods and modeling joint hazard associated with threshold exceedances across multiple locations is crucial for accurate estimation of continental-scale portfolio risk. This work uses a non-parametric copula-based spatial simulator to analyze peak floods across the United States to derive the first-of-its-kind continental portfolio risk estimates at the 10- and 100-year return levels. We find significant interdependence in floods across the nation, revealing the recurring pattern of extreme events affecting the Northeast, Central, West, and Northwest United States in the same year. The stochastic simulator effectively manages high-dimensional data and offers reliable uncertainty estimates for both spatially dependent floods and the aggregated flood losses at the continental level. El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation are identified as statistically significant tele-connectors of aggregate loss. This research aims to advance the understanding of compound continental flood hazard and the potential large-scale climate teleconnections that lead to such compound floods.",

      "journal": "Hydrology and Earth System Sciences",
      "citations": 2,
      "abstract": "In July 2021, extreme precipitation caused devastating flooding in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, particularly in the Geul River catchment. Such precipitation extremes had not been previously recorded and were not expected to occur in summer. This contributed to poor flood forecasting and, hence, extensive damage. Climate change was mentioned as a potential explanation for these unprecedented events. However, before such a statement can be made, we need a better understanding of the drivers of floods in the Geul and their long-term variability, which are poorly understood and have not been recently examined. In this paper, we use an event-based approach to identify the dominant flood drivers in the Geul. We also employ (1) a multi-temporal trend analysis to investigate their temporal variability and (2) a novel methodology to detect the dominant direction of any trend. Results suggest that extreme 24 precipitation alone is typically insufficient to cause floods. The joint probability of extreme and prolonged rainfall combined with wet initial conditions (compound event) determines the chances of flooding. Flood-producing precipitation shows a consistent increase in the winter half-year, a period in which more than 70 % of extremely high flows have historically occurred. While no consistent trend patterns are evident in the majority of precipitation and extreme flow trends in the summer half-year, an increasing direction is visible in the recent past.",

      "journal": "Science of the Total Environment",
      "citations": 4,
      "abstract": "Floods are some of the most frequent and severe natural hazards worldwide. In the context of climate change, the risk of extreme floods is expected to increase in the future. While, the trends in flood timing and risk for flood synchronization remain unclear. In this study, the seasonality of flood peaks, annual maximum rainfall, and annual maximum soil moisture in the Yangtze River Basin were examined using observational and reanalysis data from 1949 to 2020. Changes in the timing of extreme events may increase the possibility of concurrent flooding, therefore the risk for synchronous floods were further explored. The results indicate that the seasonality of floods has a strong consistency with that of annual maximum rainfall. In the southern Yangtze River Basin, floods usually occur between early June and early July, with a delayed trend. However, they occur slightly later in the north, generally from late July to early August, with a tendency of advance. Overall, the timing of floods is positively correlated with rainfall and soil moisture peaks, and the correlation is much stronger for annual maximum rainfall. However, for more intense floods or for larger catchments, soil moisture plays an important role in modulating the variations in flood timing. Reverse latitudinal changes in flood timing are expected to result in more synchronous floods. The synchrony frequency exceeded 60 % for most of the stations, and the frequency was increasing for nearly half of the region, especially in the middle reaches, Poyang Lake and south of Dongting Lake. In addition, the flood synchrony scale in the south of the basin showed significant upward trends. These findings would provide important implications for flood risk management and adaptive strategy development.",

Towards the implementation of a multi-model forecasting system for flood hazards, this study presents a coupled application of three (3) models: The WRF-ARW weather model, the WRF-Hydro hydrological model, and the HEC-RAS 2D hydraulic model. A flash flood event that occurred on 9 October 2006 in Volos city, Greece, is used as a case study to assess the accuracy of the integrated modelling approach to simulate the flood hydrograph and flood extent in Xerias ungauged catchment. The hydrometeorological simulation results indicated a severe persistent storm over Pelion mountain at the northeast of Volos, as the main factor of the major flash flood and extensive impacts. Historical flood records retrieved by several conventional and non-conventional sources are used to validate the flooded area. Compared to the collected data and prior studies, the generated inundation map of Xerias river is found to realistically capture highly impacted areas which experienced infrastructure damage and human rescues from inundated roads and buildings. Results from our analyses show that the proposed physically-based modelling approach can give reliable inputs into flood risk management.",

GSMaP showed the best performance in simulating hourly runoff with the lowest relative bias (RB) and the highest Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 4.9% and 0.79, respectively. Meanwhile, the rain gauge data was able to produce runoff with −12.2% and 0.71 for RB and NSE, respectively. The other three SRPs showed acceptable results in daily discharge simulation (NSE value between 0.42 and 0.49, and RB value between −23.3% and −31.2%). The generated flood map also agreed with the published information. In general, the SRPs, particularly the GSMaP, showed their ability to support rapid flood forecasting required for early warning of floods.",

We used the co-polarized (VV) SAR images for mapping the flood area. A change detection technique (Normalized Change Index (NCI)) which uses a pre-flood image having the same image characteristics as the flood/post-flood images is implemented on the temporal SAR images. An automatic flood mapping approach, i.e. NCI combined with thresholding is used to identify the flood area. This approach has underestimated the flood area for this particular study area which is due to the use of moderate resolution SAR images for high-density urban flood mapping. Despite underestimation, Sentinel-1 SAR images are very useful to get the first insight of flood condition in the high density urban areas.",

      "abstract": "In an effort to improve tools for effective flood risk assessment, we applied machine learning algorithms to predict flood-prone areas in Amol city (Iran), a site with recent floods (2017–2018). An ensemble approach was then implemented to predict hazard probabilities using the best machine learning algorithms (boosted regression tree, multivariate adaptive regression spline, generalized linear model, and generalized additive model) based on a receiver operator characteristic-area under the curve (ROC-AUC) assessment. The algorithms were all trained and tested on 92 randomly selected points, information from a flood inundation survey, and geospatial predictor variables (precipitation, land use, elevation, slope percent, curve number, distance to river, distance to channel, and depth to groundwater). The ensemble model had 0.925 and 0.892 accuracy for training and testing data, respectively. We then created a vulnerability map from data on building density, building age, population density, and socio-economic conditions and assessed risk as a product of hazard and vulnerability. The results indicated that distance to channel, land use, and runoff generation were the most important factors associated with flood hazard, while population density and building density were the most important factors determining vulnerability. Areas of highest and lowest flood risks were identified, leading to recommendations on where to implement flood risk reduction measures to guide flood governance in Amol city.",

      "abstract": "Flash-floods are increasingly recognized as a frequent natural hazard worldwide. Iran has been among the most devastated regions affected by the major floods. While the temporal flash-flood forecasting models are mainly developed for warning systems, the models for assessing hazardous areas can greatly contribute to adaptation and mitigation policy-making and disaster risk reduction. Former researches in the flash-flood hazard mapping have heightened the urge for the advancement of more accurate models. Thus, the current research proposes the state-of-the-art ensemble models of boosted generalized linear model (GLMBoost) and random forest (RF), and Bayesian generalized linear model (BayesGLM) methods for higher performance modeling. Furthermore, a pre-processing method, namely simulated annealing (SA), is used to eliminate redundant variables from the modeling process. Results of the modeling based on the hit and miss analysis indicates high performance for both models (accuracy = 90–92%, Kappa = 79–84%, Success ratio = 94–96%, Threat score = 80–84%, and Heidke skill score = 79–84%). The variables of distance from the stream, vegetation, drainage density, land use, and elevation have shown more contribution among others for modeling the flash-flood. The results of this study can significantly facilitate mapping the hazardous areas and further assist watershed managers to control and remediate induced damages of flood in the data-scarce regions.",

However, their high computational cost can impose practical limits on real-time flood forecasting and uncertainty analysis which require fast modelling response or many model runs. Emulation models have the potential to reduce simulation times while still maintaining acceptable accuracy of the estimates. In this study, we propose an artificial neural networks (ANNs) based emulation modelling framework for flood inundation modelling. We investigate the suitability of ANNs as flood inundation models using a river segment in Queensland, Australia. Our results show that ANNs can model the time series behaviour of flood inundation and significantly reduce the simulation times required, which facilitates their use in applications requiring fast model response or a large number of model runs.

      "title": "Towards a large-scale locally relevant flood inundation modeling framework using SWAT and LISFLOOD-FP",
      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 117,
      "abstract": "Lack of geospecificity or local relevance is a major limitation in contemporary large-scale flood modeling frameworks. There is a little practical value for configuring a large-scale model if the model produces streamflow and/or inundation maps only along the large rivers while numerous lower order streams remain overlooked. This study fills the gap through a new flood prediction framework based on the loose coupling of a hydrologic model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and a 1D/2D hydrodynamic model LISFLOOD-FP (hence, SWAT-LISFP). The prototype SWAT-LISFP framework was configured with ~26,000 stream reaches across the ~500,000 km 2 Ohio River Basin, United States. After being calibrated against 50 gauge stations across the basin, SWAT simulated streamflow outputs were fed as upstream boundary conditions in LISFLOOD-FP. The resultant flood inundation extents consistently captured 70–80% of the remotely sensed inundation, irrespective of the flood events or locations within the basin. This was also confirmed via cross-validation with an existing flood modeling framework AutoRAPID (Follum et al., 2017). Additional modeling experiments were conducted to facilitate two critical discussions – how simulated inundation extent is affected by the uncertainty in streamflow prediction and the density of streamflow boundary conditions. Taking into account the uncertainties in SWAT streamflow, LISFLOOD-FP showed a remarkable improvement with more than 95% of remotely sensed inundation captured within the simulated extent. While this approach produces a variable-area flood map (i.e., a range of areas likely to be inundated at a particular point of time), inundation in the lower order streams can still remain undetected. A solution to this problem was demonstrated by setting up streamflow boundary conditions across further lower order streams, which subsequently justified the need for high-resolution stream network, and hence, the essence of locally relevant flood inundation modeling. The new contributions of his study, particularly through introducing SWAT as a functional hydrologic alternative to supplement a hydrodynamic model such as LISFLOOD-FP and the series of experiments to draw insights on addressing lack of accuracy and local relevance, will enhance the global flood modeling initiatives.",

      "journal": "Anthropocene",
      "citations": 45,
      "abstract": "Spatial and temporal variability in precipitation, land use, and river channels introduce uncertainty in flood estimates and pose challenges for floodplain management and mitigation. Yet, standard deterministic methods for quantifying flood hazards and evaluating risk assume stationarity in a nonstationary world and fail to account for uncertainties as they translate to flood hazards. A need exists for improved methods to portray flood hazards that incorporate uncertainty and enable integrated water management. This paper presents novel techniques for evaluating flood hazards through probabilistic flood inundation maps that reflect uncertainty quantified through Monte-Carlo analyses of model inputs and parameters. These techniques represent a first in simultaneously varying discharge, friction parameters, and channel change in probabilistic floodplain mapping while maintaining the high level of detail implemented in regulatory hydraulic models. This study evaluated four methods for quantifying the 1 % annual exceedance probability flood, including a nonstationary approach, at an urban watershed in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA. The range of variability in flood extents resulting from Monte-Carlo simulations was spatially variable, and the likelihood of inundation revealed areas of elevated or hidden risk that were not revealed by deterministic regulatory flood hazard boundaries. The nonstationary approach indicates a significant increase in flood hazards and suggests that the regulatory floodplain boundary underestimates and miscommunicates its intended risk status. A simplified approach for estimating uncertainty in flood hazards closely matched ensemble results, providing managers a practical method for conducting uncertainty analysis. These techniques can aid floodplain management by accounting for the inherent uncertainty in model estimates and the potential nonstationary behavior of flood hazards.",

In this paper, the most popular convolutional neural network (CNN) is introduced to assess flood susceptibility in Shangyou County, China. The main contributions of this study are summarized as follows. First, the CNN technique is used for flood susceptibility mapping through two different CNN classification and feature extraction frameworks. Second, three data presentation methods are designed in the CNN architecture to fit the two proposed frameworks. To construct the proposed CNN-based methods, 13 flood triggering factors related to historical flood events in the study area were prepared. The performance of these CNN-based methods was evaluated using several objective criteria in comparison to the conventional support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Experiments results demonstrate that all the CNN-based methods can produce more reliable and practical flood susceptibility maps. For example, the proposed CNN-based classifiers were 0.022–0.054 higher than SVM in terms of area under the curve (AUC). In addition, in the classification process, CNN-based feature extraction can effectively improve the prediction capability of SVM by 0.021–0.051 in terms of AUC. Therefore, the proposed CNN frameworks can help mitigate and manage floods.",

In this study, four ensemble metaheuristic approaches, including the combinations of ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) with the genetic algorithm (GA), simulated annealing (SA), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), and differential evolution (DE), are used for flood zoning in Dingnan County, China. Based on historical records, aerial photo interpretation, field surveys, and Google Earth, the location of 115 floods are recorded in the study area. Different categorical and continuous factors affecting floods, including the plan curvature, altitude, distance to rivers, slope degree, rainfall, land use, lithology, stream power index, topographic wetness index, soil type, aspect, normalized difference vegetation index, and profile curvature, are identified in the study area and entered in GIS software. Flood susceptibility maps (FSMs) are validated using the ROC curve. The results confirm that the AUCs of the four combined metaheuristic models are larger than 79%. The highest AUC value is obtained for the ANFIS–GA ensemble (0.903), followed by the ANFIS–SA (0.843), ANFIS–DE (0.812), and ANFIS–ICA (0.798). The RMSEs obtained for the training data of the different models are 0.2562 (ANFIS-DE), 0.3121 (ANFIS-GA), 0.3345 (ANFIS-ICA), and 0.3398 (ANFIS-SA).

In the present paper, new modeling approaches, Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) integrated with IOE (ADT-IOE) and ADT integrated with AHP (ADT-AHP), were proposed for flash-flood susceptibility mapping across the Suha river catchment (Romania). Besides, two stand-alone methods, Index of Entropy (IOE) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), were also investigated. For this regard, 111 torrential points and 111 non-torrential points along with 8 flash-flood conditioning factors have been involved in the training process of the four models. The quality of the flash-flood models was checked by using the ROC Curve method, classification accuracy (CLA), and Kappa index. The result shows that the two ensemble models, the ADT-IOE (AUC = 0.972, CLC = 86.37%, Kappa statistics = 0.727) and the ADT-AHP (AUC = 0.926, CLA = 87.88%, Kappa statistics = 0.758), have high prediction performance and outperform the other models.

The hydraulic–GIS combined model employs the hydraulic concept in a simplified GIS frame, hence avoiding heavy computation in the hydraulic model and arbitrary coefficients in a GIS model. We used a binary logistic regression model to integrate the hydraulic concept in a GIS model. The multi-criteria GIS model built by binary logistic regression was able to simulate the results from the hydraulic model with good consistency. Such a strategy serves as a promising prototype for addressing similar geographical modelling issues, where the time-consuming physical model can be potentially replaced by a simplified GIS model. Furthermore, the impervious surface percentage is an important input in the hydraulic model. This research experimented different impervious surface percentages as input to the hydraulic model and found that a spatially variable impervious surface percentage achieves better agreement with hydraulic modelling than that of uniform (25% and 42%) impervious surface percentages.",

      "journal": "Environment International",
      "citations": 54,
      "abstract": "Flash floods evolve rapidly in time, which poses particular challenges to emergency managers. One way to support decision-making is to complement models that estimate the flash flood hazard (e.g. discharge or return period) with tools that directly translate the hazard into the expected socio-economic impacts. This paper presents a method named ReAFFIRM that uses gridded rainfall estimates to assess in real time the flash flood hazard and translate it into the corresponding impacts. In contrast to other studies that mainly focus on individual river catchments, the approach allows for monitoring entire regions at high resolution. The method consists of the following three components: (i) an already existing hazard module that processes the rainfall into values of exceeded return period in the drainage network, (ii) a flood map module that employs the flood maps created within the EU Floods Directive to convert the return periods into the expected flooded areas and flood depths, and (iii) an impact assessment module that combines the flood depths with several layers of socio-economic exposure and vulnerability. Impacts are estimated in three quantitative categories: population in the flooded area, economic losses, and affected critical infrastructures. The performance of ReAFFIRM is shown by applying it in the region of Catalonia (NE Spain) for three significant flash flood events. The results show that the method is capable of identifying areas where the flash floods caused the highest impacts, while some locations affected by less significant impacts were missed. In the locations where the flood extent corresponded to flood observations, the assessments of the population in the flooded area and affected critical infrastructures seemed to perform reasonably well, whereas the economic losses were systematically overestimated. The effects of different sources of uncertainty have been discussed: from the estimation of the hazard to its translation into impacts, which highly depends on the quality of the employed datasets, and in particular on the quality of the rainfall inputs and the comprehensiveness of the flood maps.",

      "abstract": "Flash floods are one of the most severe natural disasters throughout the world, and are responsible for sizeable social and economic losses, as well as countless injuries and death. Risk assessment, which identifies areas susceptible to flooding, has been shown to be an effective tool for managing and mitigating flash floods. The study aims to introduce the methods to determine the weights of the risk indices, and identify the different risk clusters. In this regard, we proposed a methodology for comprehensively assessing flash flood risk in a GIS environment, by the improved analytic hierarchy process (IAHP) method, and an integration of iterative self-organizing data (ISODATA) analysis and maximum likelihood (ISO-Maximum) clustering algorithm. The weight for each risk index is determined by the IAHP, which integrates the subjective characteristics with objective attributes of the assessment data. Based on the data mining technology, the integration of ISO-Maximum clustering algorithm derives a more reasonable classification. The Guangdong Province of China was selected for testing the proposed method’s applicability, and we used a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve approach to validate the modeling of the flash-flood risk distribution. The validation against the historical flash flood data indicates a high reliability of this method for comprehensive flash flood risk assessment. In order to verify the proposed method’s superiority, in addition, the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and the weights-of-evidence (WE) methods are used for comparison with the IAHP and ISO-Maximum clustering algorithm method. Moreover, we analyzed and compared the regularity of flash floods in the rural and urban areas. This study not only provides a new approach for large-scale flash flood comprehensive risk assessment, but also assists researchers and local decision-makers in designing flash flood mitigation strategies.",

      "abstract": "Floods are considered one of the most severe natural disasters worldwide. They impact vast areas, particularly in arid/semi-arid regions, causing serious damages with thousands of human casualties and billions of Euros in economic losses. This study contributes to a comprehensive evaluation of flash flooding occurrences, impacts, and possible mitigation. In this study, The Dahab region in southern Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula was selected for flash flooding vulnerability assessment. Although located in an arid region, it suffers from frequent and severe flash floods. Here, a straightforward workflow was applied to simulate the impact of flash flooding and assess the vulnerability of the Dahab area via consideration of a maximum storm event as a worst- case scenario. Originally, morphometric analysis was performed to determine the most hazardous sub-basins susceptible to flash flooding. The highest recorded storm event in the region was selected to calculate the maximum volume of surface runoff for the model simulation. Then, the hydrologic model and River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) software were used to calculate the inundation level across the entire city of Dahab. Despite some data limitations, this study shows clearly that the Dahab area would have problems incurring from flash flooding if no mitigation measures were to be considered. Results indicate that the area of Dahab is greatly vulnerable to flash flooding with approximately 72% of the total infrastructure being negatively impacted in the worst-case scenario. The adopted approach used in this study can be applied efficiently in similar regions in the Sinai Peninsula or elsewhere.",

      "journal": "Ecological Engineering",
      "citations": 66,
      "abstract": "Climate change represents a set of mechanisms that result in significant impacts toward hydrologic processes both at global and regional scales and usually they are developing countries where face the most challenging consequences. For instance, arid and semi-arid environments experience a high level of uncertainty in rainfall, which results in unforeseen periods of droughts, or high-intensity rainfall, which generates severe floods, increasing the water insecurity and flood damage in these areas. Climate pattern variations are specifically critical to forecast conditions for flood hazard management. General Circulation Models (GCMs) are useful tools to forecast future climate change scenarios. However, the application of GCM in flood hazard management is particularly challenging, given that they operate under high uncertainty and coarse scale. In this context, a five-class Flood Hazard Index (FHI) map was generated by using a multi criteria index approach, based on defining the greater influence of seven factors related to flood generation: runoff coefficient, elevation, slope, distance from the drainage network, rainfall intensity, soil erosion and land use. In this paper, we utilized monthly data for the baseline period (1980-2004), and then the output of 8 GCMs for surface air temperature (SAT) and precipitation were downscaled using a statistical model and evaluated in the baseline period. Consequently, the most suitable models were selected according to their average monthly performance. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was then used to develop a runoff coefficient map, using the downscaled outputs of the selected GCMs. Accordingly, a flood hazard model was developed at a large basin in the northeast of Iran for baseline and future periods (2040-2064) under RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. Having validated the generated flood map for the baseline period, the future maps were generated and compared. Results show the increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation; however, it was found that rainfall intensities are to be increased. This supports the final flood hazard map for the future climate conditions scenario with an increased relative hazard level. This was particularly observed in flat, and moderate sloped areas, compared to the model results with historic climate data.",

      "abstract": "The global warming and climate changes determined a considerable increase in the frequency of floods and their related damages. Therefore, the high accuracy prediction of flood susceptible areas plays a key role in flood warnings and risk reduction. The main objective of this study is to propose novel hybridizations of fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP), Index of Entropy (IoE), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for predicting the areas susceptible to floods. Buzău river catchment (Romania) was the area on which the present study was focused. In this regard, a database with 205 flooded locations, 205 non-flood locations and 12 flood predictors was established and used to train and validate the flood susceptibility models. The performance of the proposed models was evaluated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve and statistical metrics. The results show that all the hybrid models have a high prediction performance and outperform the stand-alone models. Among them, the SVM-IoE model (AUC = 0.979) has the highest performance, followed by the FAHP-IoE (AUC = 0.97), IoE (AUC = 0.969), SVM (AUC = 0.966) and FAHP (AUC = 0.947). These results highlight a very high efficiency of all the applied models. The application of the models mentioned above revealed that a percentage between 12.5% (FPI IoE ) and 21.2% (FPI FAHP ) of the study area is characterized by high and very high exposure to these hydrological hazards.",

      "abstract": "Flood events are one of the most common natural disasters in the United States and can disrupt businesses; strain the financial resources of agencies that respond; and often leave households dislocated for days, months, or permanently. Community resilience planning requires an assessment of the damage and loss caused by a hazard followed by recovery modeling, which couples the socioeconomics with the physical-infrastructure recovery process. This paper focuses on the first part of that analysis chain, namely damage and loss modeling to riverine flooding at the community level, with a case study of Lumberton, North Carolina, using empirical damage fragilities. The process includes the major components toward flood-loss quantification. The losses in the case study are computed from the damage fragilities and compared with the deterministic flood loss analysis in HAZUS-MH, which uses stage-damage functions. For the case study presented in this paper, the fragility-based approach resulted in slightly higher loss estimates. The fragility-based approach presented as part of this study can provide a mechanism to propagate uncertainty in damage and loss estimates. This ability to propagate such uncertainty into the analysis would allow for risk-informed decision making for floods using a similar approach to what is currently done for earthquake and wind community-level loss analyses.",

      "abstract": "Predicting river discharge and inundation is crucial for water resources management and flood hazard reduction; however, it is still unclear to what extent their variabilities can be captured on global scale. This study evaluates uncertainty sources in the quasi-global river discharge and inundation simulations using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrologic model and the Catchment-based Macroscale Floodplain (CaMa-Flood) hydrodynamic model, forced with five high-resolution satellite precipitation datasets. The simulated discharge is first evaluated against more than 2852 sites selected from the Global Streamflow Indices and Metadata Archive (GSIM) dataset, and then the simulated inundation is compared with complementary multiple satellite observations. Globally, about 38% – 43% of the stations produce reasonable discharge simulations with positive Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) on monthly time scale. The simulations show good agreement for flood fractions with mean correlations ranging from 0.47 to 0.62 for satellite detected events. The potential uncertainties sources of discharge and inundation simulation related to physics setting and forcing datasets, such as precipitation, land surface model, routing model, and observation from site and satellite are discussed, as well as future directions for improving large-scale model applications. By using default model settings, we hope our study can offer valuable insights into the applicability of flood simulations and provide guides for model development.",

The purpose of employing such tools is to simulate flood damage in a given area, depending on several flood scenarios with various intensity, duration, and return periods. Recently, raster-based hydraulic models have been considered in modeling the determination of floodplain and flood hydraulics. In this paper, a 2D hydraulic model, ie, LISFLOOD-FP was applied to predict floodplains of various return periods over a 4.5 km reach from the Khorramabad River in Lorestan province. The model was calibrated based on a flood event using the parameters of floodplain and channel roughness coefficients against the observed floodplain depth at the hydrometric station. The roughness coefficient parameters were estimated by the calibration process to minimize the relative error (E) index between the observed floodplain depth and the predicted depth. This model was validated using two separate flood events. The relative error (E) index was 2.9% at the calibration stage and 1.7 and 15.4% at the validation stage for both flood events. Finally, the calibrated model was used to predict the floods of various return periods.",

      "abstract": "Floods are among the extreme natural events which result in catastrophic damage to properties and adversely effects communities. To curb and manage the effects of such events, the decision-makers and disaster management authorities require dependable data in terms of flood depth, discharge, magnitude, and special datasets. The low lying areas of Navsari city was inundated in the floods of 2002 and 2003. This study aims to use the latest version of HEC-RAS for 1D hydrodynamic flood modelling of Purna river in Navasari city, Gujarat, India, with special reference to geospatial techniques. This study is aimed to demonstrate the geospatial analyzing capabilities of HEC-RAS v5. For the purpose of flood modeling, the river data such as bank lines, flow path lines, cross-section cut lines are extracted from Cartosat-1 DEM (Digital Elevation Model). Steady flow analysis is carried out for the simulation of a 1D hydrodynamic model. The outcome obtained from the model is in the form of water depth, which can be observed in the geospatial HEC-RAS mapper window. The flood depth maps for the 2002 and 2004 flood events are generated, which indicate that the low lying areas of Navsari city near Jalalpore and Viraval are susceptible to flooding when the discharge in the river exceeds 8836 m 3 /s. The accuracy of the model is calculated by comparing the simulated data with the observed data for the above-mentioned flood events. The results obtained from the 1D models are promising and accurate.",

      "abstract": "Topographic data in the form of digital elevation models (DEMs) play a significant role in flood management. Despite the increasing availability of DEMs for large regions, there is a need to evaluate their performance at the inundation/flood level, while considering the overall complexity of flood models. The present study identifies, for the first time, the uncertainties generated in both river channel and overland flooding while considering a set of nine variants from various sources (LiDAR, Cartosat, SRTM, and ASTER) and grid resolutions (resampled versions) in the presence of discharge, rainfall, and tide boundary conditions for a severely flood-prone catchment in the Mahanadi River Basin, India. Extensive geostatistical analyses reveal the existence of significant biases with global DEMs i.e., SRTM and ASTER, whereas interestingly the LiDAR and Carto DEMs exhibit a high degree of isotropy. The global DEMs fail to capture several inundated spots; thus plummeting the flood inundation extents to a sufficient degree of unacceptability. Prominently, the inability in identifying high and very high flood depths (>1.5 m) over the coastal stretches results in large uncertainties in the majority of the grids. Our analysis reveals the existence of significant noise in global DEMs, which nullifies the hydrodynamic interaction during the coupling of 1-D and 2-D flood models in presence of tidal influence. We recommend that under unavailability of precise LiDAR DEMs, resampled and freely available Carto DEMs, that are as efficient as LiDAR if not more, be given higher preference. We caution against the copious usage of global DEMs for large data-scarce and flood-prone regions, as the DEM uncertainty may be substantially amplified at the inundation level during combined channel and overland flood simulations. Through this study, we would like to recommend the proposed framework as a guided step while selecting appropriate DEM for flood inundation mapping over large data scarce regions.",

      "abstract": "Flash flooding is one of the most devastating natural disasters in China. A quantitative flash flood hazard assessment is important for saving human lives and reducing economic losses. In this study, integrated rainfall-runoff modeling (HEC-HMS) and hydraulic modeling (FLO-2D) schemes were used to assess flash flood inundation areas and depths under 5-year, 10-year, 25-year, 50-year, 100-year, 200-year, 500-year and 1000-year rainfall scenarios in a mountainous basin (Hadahe River Basin, HRB) in northern China. The overall flash flood hazard in HRB is high. Under the eight rainfall scenarios, the total flooded area ranged from 6 to 8.73 km2; the flash flood inundation areas with depths of 1-2 m, 2-3 m, and over 3 m was 1.53-2.69 km2, 0.63-1.44 km2 and 0.33-1.11 km2, respectively; and these areas accounted for 25.5-30.8%, 10.5-16.5% and 5.5-12.7% of the whole flooded area. The total flooded area increases rapidly with the return period increasing from 5 to 200 years, and the increase gradient slows when the return period is greater than 200 years. In the downstream area of HRB, the flash flood area with inundation depths greater than 1 m accounted for 54-71% of the flooded area under the eight scenarios. In comparison to other areas in the HRB, the downstream area is at the highest risk given its extensive inundation and substantial property exposure. The quantitative hazard assessment framework presented in this study can be applied in other mountainous basins for flash flood defense and disaster management purposes.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of climate and land use changes on flood susceptibility areas in the Tajan watershed, Iran. To do this, land use changes over the next 20 years (2019–2040) were predicted from land use changes of the past 29 years (1990–2019) using the land change modeler (LCM) method. Future climate change was projected for the next 20 years (2020–2040) based on climate data from 1990 to 2015 using Lars-WG software and two scenarios, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. Twelve factors that influence flooding and 262 locations of past floods were used to model the spatial pattern of flood susceptibility in the watershed. A random forest (RF) model and a Bayesian generalized linear model (GLMbayes) were used to predict areas susceptible to flooding. The results showed that elevation (21.55), distance from river (15.28), land use (11.1), slope (10.58), and rainfall (6.8) are the most important factors affecting flooding in this basin. The factors were modified according to land use changes and climate changes and the models were revised. The land use and climate forecasting in this region indicate that land use change, like decreased forest cover (−77.19 km 2 ) and reduced rangeland (−218.83 km 2 ) near rivers and downstream, can be expected and rainfall is projected to increase (under from both scenarios). These changes would result in increased probabilities of flooding in the downstream portion of the watershed and near the sea. The area-under-the-curve evaluation of the models indicates that the RF model more accurately predicted flood probability (0.91) than did the GLMbayes model (0.847).",

      "abstract": "Flash flood is considered as one of the most destructive natural hazards worldwide, especially in tropical countries, where tropical cyclones with torrential rains are recurrent problems yearly. Therefore, an accurate prediction of susceptible areas to flash floods is crucial for developing measures to prevent, avoid, and minimize damages associated with flash floods. The aim of this research is to propose a new state-of-the-art model based on hybridizing Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) and the Credal Decision Tree (CDT) ensemble, namely the QPSO-CDTreeEns model, for spatial prediction of the flash flood. The concept of the proposed model is to build a forest tree of the CDT established through the Random Subspace ensemble. Therein, QPSO is integrated to optimize the three parameters, the subspace size, number of trees, and the maximum depth of trees. A district suffered from a high frequency of flash floods in the north-western mountainous area of Vietnam was selected as a case study. In this regard, a geospatial database that includes a total of 1698 flash flood and inundation polygons derived from Sentinel-1 C-band SAR images and ten input indicators were used to construct and to verify the proposed model. The result shows that the QPSO-CDT-Ens model performed well (Overall accuracy = 90.4, Kappa coefficient = 0.807) and outperformed the five machine learning algorithms in flash flood susceptibility mapping. Among the ten factors, the land-use/land-cover (LULC), the slope, the curvature, and the TWI are the most important indicators. We conclude that the proposed model is a promising tool for flash flood susceptibility mapping in the tropics and may assist decision-makers in sustainable land-use planning in the national disaster mitigation strategies.",

      "citations": 49,
      "abstract": "In view of an exponential increase in the negative impacts of flash-floods globally, the present work aims at the identification of flash-floods-prone river reaches in the Beas river basin, Himachal Pradesh, India using a multi-criteria indexing technique. The flood hazard index (FHI) was computed by implementing analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model on 6 hydrologic parameters influencing flood hazard, namely rainfall intensity, curve number (CN) grid, time of travel, slope, Manning's roughness coefficient and drainage density. The CN grid (empirical parameter to estimate direct surface runoff) was used as one of the parameters which depend upon the land use, hydrologic soil group and hydrologic conditions. It is imperative to mention that remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) techniques played a crucial role in the preparation of these 6 parameter layers. The AHP model calculates the normalized weights for each parameter using pair-wise comparison matrices. The rainfall intensity and curve number were the factors having the highest normalized weight of 34.52 each. Subsequently, the estimated weights of the parameters and hazard level-wise rating scores were used in a GIS environment to generate FHI. The generated FHI raster was masked using floodplain layer within geomorphology map and river buffer to identify flash-floods-affected river reaches. The generated flash-floods map was validated by historical flash-floods ground points, field observations and remote sensing data. The results depicted that the river reaches in the north and east of the Beas basin are susceptible to flash-floods which are mainly governed by heavy rainfall intensity and high runoff characteristics. The river stretches namely Bahang–Manali (Beas), Kullu–Bhuntar (Beas) and Manikaran–Kheer-Ganga (Parvati) have been categorized into very high and high flash-floods zones. Decreasing trend of normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) was observed for river reaches falling within the very high and high zones indicating the vegetation loss post successive flash-floods events. The river order 2 lies in the very high and high flash-floods zones, indicating the fact that the contribution of tributaries is significant to flood events. Flash-floods map will serve as catastrophic product, which will help policymakers to take suitable measures to reduce the risk of flash-floods.",

      "abstract": "Floods are extreme events affecting millions of people worldwide and causing loss worth billions. The magnitude and frequency of floods are likely to increase with altered climate, and developing countries tend to suffer the most because of low resilience and adaptive capacity. This research aimed to analyze existing and preferred future flood adaptation strategies in a flood-prone West Rapti River (WRR) Basin of Nepal, using hydrological analysis and flood modelling, and a social survey of 240 households (HHs) and several focus group discussions (FGDs). The specific objectives were to (1) understand the rainfall-flood behaviour of the basin in a simplistic way, (2) carry out flood modelling to generate inundation maps for informing the local people, and (3) identify flood adaptation strategies based on people’s perception. Flood inundation maps are generated for four scenarios based on return periods: scenario I (2 years), scenario II (20 years), scenario III (50 years), and scenario IV (100 years). Results show that the southern parts of three rural municipalities (Duduwa, Narainapur, and Rapti Sonari) get inundated almost every year irrespective of the flood magnitude. This information was presented to local communities before administering the HH survey and FGDs so that they could make informed decisions. During the survey, the preference of people’s adaptation strategies for the four flood scenarios was explored and prioritized. Our findings suggest that peoples’ thoughts and preferences for adaptation strategies changed with exposure to flood magnitudes. For example, “bamboo mesh with sand filled bags”—simplest and least expensive adaptation strategy—was preferred for a less severe flood while a complex and expensive technique “reservoir/flood regulating structures” was preferred for a devastating flood scenario. Thus, this study has highlighted firstly, the importance of inundation maps to understand and inform the local people about floods and their impacts; and secondly, the value of information to the people enabling them to make informed decisions. The novelty of this empirical study lies in a multi-disciplinary assessment framework which integrates scientific information, stakeholder knowledge, and local people’s perceptions of flood risks and adaptation strategies for the future. Such an approach of hydro-social analysis has the potential for replication in flood-prone regions globally, with similar bio-physical and socio-economic conditions.",

Flood risk management is essential to reduce the effects of flood on human lives and livelihoods. The main goals of this research were flash flood risk analysis and risk quantification in terms of land use land cover using geo-spatial technology in Shewa Robit town. In the present study, elevation, slope, drainage density, distance from river, NDVI, land use land cover, topographic wetness index and curvature were used as parameters determining flash flood risk. To realize these research objectives, all these data were reclassified in to five classes and different weights for each of them was assigned using analytic hierarchy process. Weighted Sum Overlay (WSO) analyses of ARC GIS software was employed to produce flood vulnerability map. Then, the accuracy of generated flood risk map was validated using historical flood data. According to the result, about 3.08%, 14.62% and 20.66% of Shewa Robit town are at a very high, high and moderate flash flood risk, respectively. In addition to this, flood risk was also quantified in terms of land use land cover. The result indicates that the settlement land use is the most vulnerable with an estimated area of 12.01 ha, 99.57 ha and 174.16 ha in very high, high and moderate risk classes.

      "abstract": "Mapping flood risk zone is an essential task in the arid region for sustainable water resources management. Due to the lack of hydrological and meteorological information and disaster event inventory in Xinjiang, China, storm flood disaster (SFD) risk zoning is an effective technique in investigating the potential impact of SFD. In this study, the statistics about natural, social, and risk related to SFD are collated. With the help of the compiled inventory data, a disaster risk assessment model for storm flood is proposed for the Xinjiang region based on the random forest (RF) algorithm. Randomly selected negative and positive samples from the historical SFD locations are composed of five different total samples. The overall prediction accuracy of the five sample groups attained 83.48%, indicating that the proposed RF model can well capture the spatial distribution of SFD in Xinjiang. It should also be noted that the spatial heterogeneity and complexity of SFD had a significant effect on its spatial distribution in Xinjiang. There are spatial distribution characteristics of lowland plains and high plateaus; the main mountainous regions, plains in the middle‐lower reaches of major rivers, and areas surrounding major lakes are prone to flooding. The variable importance RF indicates that the disaster risk is mainly affected by the following factors, including hazard factors, catastrophic intensity, population density, as well as economic development in the affected area. Besides, latitude, longitude, agricultural acreage, road density, distance from rivers, and the maximum monthly precipitation account for most of the increase in storm flooding disasters, and they are the main triggering point for SFD in Xinjiang. The proposed model provides some insight into the disaster in the mountainous region, and gives useful guidance for the national macro‐control of flood prevention and disaster reduction.",

      "abstract": "Flash floods are responsible for loss of life and considerable property damage in many countries. Flood susceptibility maps contribute to flood risk reduction in areas that are prone to this hazard if appropriately used by land-use planners and emergency managers. The main objective of this study is to prepare an accurate flood susceptibility map for the Haraz watershed in Iran using a novel modeling approach (DBPGA) based on Deep Belief Network (DBN) with Back Propagation (BP) algorithm optimized by the Genetic Algorithm (GA). For this task, a database comprising ten conditioning factors and 194 flood locations was created using the One-R Attribute Evaluation (ORAE) technique. Various well-known machine learning and optimization algorithms were used as benchmarks to compare the prediction accuracy of the proposed model. Statistical metrics include sensitivity, specificity accuracy, root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC) were used to assess the validity of the proposed model. The result shows that the proposed model has the highest goodness-of-fit (AUC = 0.989) and prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.985), and based on the validation dataset it outperforms benchmark models including LR (0.885), LMT (0.934), BLR (0.936), ADT (0.976), NBT (0.974), REPTree (0.811), ANFIS-BAT (0.944), ANFIS-CA (0.921), ANFIS-IWO (0.939), ANFIS-ICA (0.947), and ANFIS-FA (0.917). We conclude that the DBPGA model is an excellent alternative tool for predicting flash flood susceptibility for other regions prone to flash floods.",

      "abstract": "Flood risk assessment is an important task for disaster management activities in flood-prone areas. Therefore, it is crucial to develop accurate flood risk assessment maps. In this study, we proposed a flood risk assessment framework which combines flood susceptibility assessment and flood consequences (human health and financial impact) for developing a final flood risk assessment map using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) method. Two hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, namely ABMDT (AdaBoost-DT) and BDT (Bagging-DT) were developed with Decision Table (DT) as a base classifier for creating a flood susceptibility map. We used 847 flood locations of major flooding events in the years 2007, 2009 and 2013 in Quang Nam province of Vietnam; and 14 flood influencing factors of topography, geology, hydrology and environment to construct and validate the hybrid AI models. Various statistical measures were used to validate the models, including the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve called AUC. Results show that all the proposed models performed well, but the performance of the BDT model (AUC = 0.96) is the best in comparison to other models ABMDT (AUC = 0.953) and single DT (AUC = 0.929). Therefore, the flood susceptibility map produced by the BDT model was used to combine with a flood consequences map to develop a reliable flood risk assessment map for the study area. The final flood risk map can provide a useful source for better flood hazard management of the study area, and the proposed framework and models can be applied to other flood-prone areas.",

      "abstract": "Flash flood risk assessment, a widely applied technology in preventing catastrophic flash flood disasters, has become the current research hotspot. However, most existing machine learning methods for assessing flash flood risk rely on a single classifier, which is suitable for processing small sets of sample data, but the resulting prediction accuracy and generalization ability are insufficient. Meanwhile, machine learning methods that integrate multiple classifiers are thus far unknown. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is an excellent algorithm for ensemble learning methods which has achieved remarkable results in many fields. It not only optimizes the algorithm but also automatically applies the CPU's multi-threading to perform parallel calculations, thus greatly improving the model training speed and prediction accuracy. Therefore, this article introduces the XGBoost model for the assessment of flash flood risk, and then combines the two input strategies and the Least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) model to verify its optimal effect, thus proposing the XGBoost-based method for flash flood risk assessment. Subsequently, an attribution analysis was implemented to assess the possible errors of this approach; and finally, a county-level flash flood risk map for Yunnan Province, China, was generated based on the proposed method. The results demonstrate that: (1) XGBoost performs well, with an accuracy of 0.84 in the testing period, and its five indices (precision, recall, accuracy, kappa, and F-score) are all higher than those of LSSVM. (2) The XGBoost-based approach provided the reliable flash flood risk maps, which were validated by another flash flood inventory, although some errors may be attributed to critical environmental factors and statistical disaster location accuracy. (3) The high-risk counties (including high-risk and highest-risk) accounted for 40.3%, with the highest-risk counties mainly concentrated in southeastern Yunnan. This article further addresses the limitations of XGBoost (e.g., as a time-consuming greedy algorithm, the non-necessity of multi-threaded optimization). All of the above results indicate that the XGBoost-based method is an effective method for obtaining high-quality county-level flash flood risk maps, which contributes to the theoretical basis for ongoing county-level flash flood prevention in China.",

      "journal": "International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction",
      "citations": 101,
      "abstract": "Rapid urbanization and climate change have increased the risk of urban flooding, causing massive infrastructure and human losses. The concept of resilience proposes new solutions to manage flood disaster. An urban flood resilience evaluation framework considering the flood disaster cycle of actual historic flood event and objective physical-socio-economic status is necessary for future flood mitigation. This paper proposes a holistic evaluation framework for evaluating urban flood resilience with VIKOR and Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) method. The proposed framework consists of indicators of resistance, coping, recovery and adaptation capacity of resilience for three stages of the flood disaster cycle, namely pre, during and post-flood. The framework has been applied to Yangtze River Delta (YRD) consisting 27 cities in China. Following a rigorous analysis, the cities are ranked and mapped, among which Nanjing stands out to be the first, whereas the entire region presents a moderate level of urban flood resilience varying from city to city. The detailed comparison with sensitivity analysis of resilience at regional, provincial and city level suggests a better resilience in pre-flood stage than post-flood stage. Finally, practical recommendations to regional and local level are provided for further flood mitigation and resilience improvement. The proposed framework is generalizable and useful to develop flood related standards, establish benchmarks, perform evaluation at regional, provincial and city levels across China and other parts of the world.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 66,
      "abstract": "Multi-hazard risk assessment may provide comprehensive analysis of the impact of multiple hazards but still needs to resolve major challenges in three aspects: (1) proper consideration of hazard inter-dependency, (2) physically based modelling of hazard interactions, and (3) fully quantitative risk assessment to show the probability of loss. Compound flooding is a typical multi-hazard problem that involves the concurrence of multiple hazard drivers, e.g. heavy rainfall, extreme river flow, and storm surge. These hazard drivers may result from the same weather system and are thus statistically inter-dependent, physically overlayed and interacted in the same region. This paper aims to address the mentioned challenges and develop an integrated assessment framework to quantify compound flood risk. The framework is constructed based on the three typical components in disaster risk assessment, i.e. hazard, vulnerability and exposure analysis. In hazard analysis, joint probability and return period distributions of the three hazard drivers of compound flooding are estimated using Copula functions with hazard dependency analysis, which are then used to generate random multi-hazard events to drive a 2D high-performance hydrodynamic model to produce probabilistic inundation maps and frequency-inundation curves. Vulnerability and exposure analysis provides damage functions of the elements at risk, which are used to quantify multi-hazard risk with the frequency-inundation curves. The framework is applied in the Greater London and its downstream Thames estuary to demonstrate its capability to analyse hazard interactions and inter-dependencies to produce fully quantitative risk assessment results such as risk curves quantifying the probability of loss and risk maps illustrating the annual expected loss of residential buildings.",

      "citations": 17,
      "abstract": "In the assessment of flood risk, the future flood hazard due to climate change is often tied to the present socioeconomic conditions. This makes an implicit assumption that the drivers of risk, other than the hazard, remain constant with time. Therefore, such risk assessment does not provide a realistic outlook for devising plausible mitigation strategies and plans. In this study, flood risk was assessed from an integrated perspective by considering both physical hazard, and socioeconomic exposure and vulnerability—all changing with time. The flood hazard in the Arial Khan River floodplain in the southcentral Bangladesh was simulated with a two‐dimensional hydrodynamic model, and the exposure and vulnerability were projected using different statistical techniques. Principal component analysis was conducted to assign weights to the indicators of hazard, exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The results show that the flood depth, duration, and extent would increase from the baseline to 2080s under regional concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The sensitivity and vulnerability would decrease, reflecting an improved adaptive capacity. The low‐risk areas could increase from 62% in the baseline to 85%–91% in 2080s depending on the RCPs. The approach followed can be applied elsewhere in developing countries, particularly in riverine floodplain settings.",

      "citations": 37,
      "abstract": "Although the growing number of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites has increased their application in flood-extent mapping, predictive models for the analysis of flood dynamics that are independent of sensor characteristics must be developed to fully extract information from SAR images for flood mitigation. This study aimed to develop hybrid machine-learning models for flood mapping in the Ahvaz region, Iran, based on SAR data. Each hybrid model consists of a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm coupled with one of the following metaheuristic optimization procedures: grey wolf optimization (GWO), differential evolution, and the imperialist competitive algorithm. Sentinel-1 acquired SAR images before and during flooding between 20 March and 26 May of 2019. The goodness-of-fit level and predictive capability of each model were scrutinized using overall accuracy, producer accuracy, and user accuracy. The SVM-GWO approach yielded the highest accuracy with overall accuracies of 96.07% and 93.39% in the training and validation steps, respectively. Furthermore, this hybrid model provided the most accurate classification of water-inundation class based on producer accuracy (96.67%) and user accuracy (95.05%). The results highlight that wetland is the last land-use/land-cover type to return to normal conditions due to the many previously dry oxbow lakes that could trap water for a long time. Furthermore, the nine most suitable sites for flood-protection structures (e.g., embankments and levees) were identified based on floodwater distribution analysis. This work describes a robust, data-parsimonious approach that will benefit flood mitigation studies seeking to identify the most suitable locations for embankments based on spatio-temporal flood dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the temporal and spatial patterns of flood in the Awash River basin, which is located in Ethiopia’s Afar region, is crucial. The Awash basin was picked because it is continuously in danger both spatially and temporally. The likelihood of flooding was assessed using eight independent variables: elevation, slope, rainfall, drainage density, land use, soil type, wetness index, and lineament density. Each constituent was assigned a weight based on its susceptibility to the danger, which was classified into four classifications. Exploratory regression analysis showed that the existing land use is the main factor influencing flood susceptibility. For the GIS domain, a total of 31 models were built using exploratory regression. Model number 31 was found to be the best fit model, having the highest Adjusted R 2 value of 0.8 and the lowest Akaike’s Information criterion value of 1536.8. The spatial autocorrelation tool’s Z score and p-value for the standard residuals are, respectively, 0.7 and 0.4, indicating that they were neither clustered nor scattered. The geographic breadth of flood susceptibility and risk is thoroughly examined in this paper, as is the significance of spatial planning in the Awash basin.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 33,
      "abstract": "With increasing urban flood risk due to urbanisation and climate change, flood hazard prediction is ever more crucial for flood risk management and emergency response. However, when sufficient high-quality data are lacking, a standard flood inundation modelling approach has significant uncertainties. Therefore, this study develops a bottom-up approach for urban flood hazard mapping at multiple levels (grid-kilometre-district), built upon the integration of grid-based flood modelling with data acquisition from open sources. This reduces the adverse effects of data scarcity and quality on hazard modelling. In the paper, we first set out an integrated approach for gridded inundation mapping in an urban basin using a hydrodynamic model supported by crowd-sourced social media data. Then, applying the model to flooding in Chengdu in August 2020, we articulate how input data bias and parameter uncertainty both affect urban inundation modelling. The results show that the choice of terrain data and the quantification of urban drainage flows significantly influence the modelled urban inundation extent, depth and duration. This indicates the potential for large variation when using urban inundation mapping merely relying on a single-scale flood hydrodynamic modelling even when supported by crowd-sourced data. The multilevel hazard mapping approach developed here presents multi-layered and comprehensive inundation mapping; thus the effects of data bias or availability are reduced and the coarser hazard mapping shows less sensitivity to the data input quality and model uncertainty, indicating relatively higher reliability at this higher spatial scale. The grid-kilometre-district three level approach provides more reliable flood hazard mapping, which can support rainstorm-induced flood management in data scarce cities.",

Here, we integrated the so-called Forecasting Inundation Extents using Rotated empirical orthogonal function analysis (FIER) framework with an altimetry-based operational Mekong River level forecasting system and built an operational web application, FIER-Mekong, (https://fier-mekong.streamlit.app/) that generates daily skillful forecasted inundation extents (>70% of critical success index) and depths in about 3 and 30 s, respectively, with up to 18-day lead times. One of its applications, predicting flood-induced rice economic losses, is also presented. Had FIER-Mekong being adopted, we estimated that the rice damages, up to 87 and 53 million US dollars during the 2020 and 2021 harvest time, respectively, could have been avoided.",

      "abstract": "Climate change has resulted in the increased frequency of extreme storms and associated flood risk uncertainties in urban areas, which brings more challenges to future urban flood prevention. Assessing future trends in probabilistic urban flood risk can improve uncertainty estimation of urban floods under climate change, and thus it is becoming increasingly urgent and important. In this study, a probabilistic risk assessment approach of urban flooding was developed to quantify the probabilistic flood risk in urban areas and assess the impacts of future climate change on flood risk. Results showed probabilistic urban flood risk under the historical condition ranged from 0 to 0.508 with a mean value of 0.104, indicating probabilistic urban flood risk was at the medium risk level. The areas where probabilistic flood risk reached the medium risk level under historical condition accounted for 34.3 % of the study area. The ranges of probabilistic flood risk in the study area were 0-0.588 and 0-0.601 with mean values of 0.126 and 0.131 under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 climate change scenarios, respectively. The areas where probabilistic flood risk reached the high risk level respectively accounted for 17.1 % and 32.7 % of the study area for SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. Compared with the historical period, probabilistic risk of urban flooding in the study area was projected to increase by 51.3 % and 67.4 % on average for SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively. The largest increase of probabilistic flood risk was approximately 200 % and 250 % for the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively, which mainly occurred for forestlands and grasslands. These results can effectively improve the uncertainty estimation of risk trends for urban floods under future climate change, and thus better-informed decision making for urban flood prevention.",

      "abstract": "Floods are one of the most frequent global natural hazards resulting in significant human and economic losses. Therefore, assessing and mapping flood hazard levels is essential to reduce the severity of future flood disasters. This study developed an integrated methodology to evaluate flood risk using an improved Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Entropy Weight (AHP-EW) method based on cosine similarity (COS-AHP-EW). This method has more scientific results because it combines subjective and objective information. The proposed method’s viability was then tested in Wuhan, China. Fourteen flood-inducing indicators were identified for the flood hazard, vulnerability, and restorability index system, with the indicator weights calculated using the COS-AHP-EW. This study utilized the Jenks method to develop the Wuhan flood risk map. We observed that the very high risk and high-risk areas covered 2.43% and 11.54% of the total study area and were mainly distributed in the highest economic and urbanization development and low-permeability districts, respectively. The validation with the historical waterlogging points reflected the accuracy and reliability of the COS-AHP-EW. The superiority of the proposed method was further verified by comparing it with single-evaluation methods (AHP and Entropy Weight) and another combined weight method (combined AHP-EW based on ideal point theory, namely, Ideal-AHP-EW). The comparison results indicated that the COS-AHP-EW was more accurate at predicting the risk in flood-prone area. Flood risk maps generated using the COS-AHP-EW could be applied to improve flood risk assessments, and the proposed method could be extended to other study areas to provide reliable flood management information.",

      "citations": 33,
      "abstract": "Ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP), which is generally achieved by combining ensemble weather forecast (EWF) and hydrological model, has a wide application. However, the EWF is biased and underdispersive, and therefore cannot be directly used to build ESP. The skillful forecast lead time of EWF in ESP needs to be determined, and the uncertainty of hydrological models is also nonnegligible. In this study, raw meteorological forecasts are corrected by the generator-based postprocessing method (GPP), the skillful forecast lead time of EWF is determined by comparison with a historical resampling method, and hydrological model uncertainty is investigated using Bayesian model average. The results indicate that GPP can significantly reduce bias and improve dispersion. With a superior postprocessing method, the skillful forecast lead times are 9 and 14 lead days for precipitation and temperature, respectively. With the synthetic effects of precipitation and temperature, the ESP has a skillful forecast lead time for around 10 lead days in terms of both deterministic and probabilistic metrics. However, the skillful lead time may be shortened to 5 days for flood season streamflow predictions. In addition, the hydrological model is an important source of uncertainty in ESPs, especially when evaluating ESPs in terms of probabilistic metrics. The ESP based on a combination of multiple hydrological models outperforms that based on a single model. Overall, this study indicates that the combination of postprocessed EWFs and multiple hydrological models is an effective approach for ESPs.",

      "abstract": "Watershed is the basic unit for studying different hydrologic processes. Flow forecasting in a watershed is dependent upon the rainfall. The effect of erroneous rainfall prediction is a source of uncertainty in flow forecasting. In this study, a model is proposed to improve the flow forecasting on real-time basis. The proposed model has three components (1) Adaptive Grey Rainfall Forecasting Model, (2) Rainfall-Runoff Model and (3) Fuzzy Updating Model. The proposed forecasting model is tested for lead periods of 1 to 3 h with hourly rainfall and discharge data. In this study, four different cases using combination of three models are discussed and the results are compared. The study has been carried out on three Indian watersheds namely Banha, Harsul and Khadakohol. The performance of the model is measured using Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (E), Correlation Coefficient (r), Error of Peak Discharge (EQ peak ) and Error of Time to Peak (ET peak ). It is observed that the case with integration of all three models performed good with a forecasting efficiency of E = 0.950, 0.861, 0.564; and r = 0.991, 0.972, 0.897 for lead-1, 2, 3 respectively for Banha watershed. For Harsul watershed, E = 0.898, 0.704, 0.367; and r = 0.985, 0.949, 0.834 for lead-1, 2, 3 respectively. For Khadakohol watershed, E = 0.968, 0.932, 0.787; and r = 0.994, 0.987, 0.951 for lead-1, 2, 3 respectively. EQ peak is less than 10% for lead-1 for most of the events and increased slightly for lead-2 and lead-3. ET peak is 0 h for all lead periods of the three watersheds. The proposed model is useful for farmers in planning and monitoring of water resources for crop management and helps in taking necessary actions during heavy rains and floods.",

This study proposed a probabilistic inflow forecasting scheme for the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) at 1–3 d lead times. The post-processing method Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS) is used to derive probabilistic inflow forecasts from ensemble inflow forecasts. Considering the inherent skew feature of the inflow series, lognormal and gamma distributions are used as EMOS predictive distributions in addition to conventional normal distribution. Results show that TGR’s ensemble inflow forecasts at 1–3 d lead times perform well with high model efficiency and small mean absolute error. Underestimation of forecasting uncertainty is observed for the raw ensemble inflow forecasts with biased probability integral transform (PIT) histograms. The three EMOS probabilistic forecasts outperform the raw ensemble forecasts in terms of both deterministic and probabilistic performance at 1–3 d lead times. The EMOS results are more reliable with much flatter PIT histograms, coverage rates approximate to the nominal coverage 89.47% and satisfactory sharpness. Results also show that EMOS with gamma distribution is superior to normal and lognormal distributions. This research can provide reliable probabilistic inflow forecasts without much variation of TGR’s operational inflow forecasting procedure.",

      "abstract": "Flash floods occur frequently and distribute widely in mountainous areas because of complex geographic and geomorphic conditions and various climate types. Effective flash flood forecasting with useful lead times remains a challenge due to its high burstiness and short response time. Recently, machine learning has led to substantial changes across many areas of study. In hydrology, the advent of novel machine learning methods has started to encourage novel applications or substantially improve old ones. This study aims to establish a discharge forecasting model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for flash flood forecasting in mountainous catchments. The proposed LSTM flood forecasting (LSTM-FF) model is composed of T multivariate single-step LSTM networks and takes spatial and temporal dynamics information of observed and forecast rainfall and early discharge as inputs. The case study in Anhe revealed that the proposed models can effectively predict flash floods, especially the qualified rates (the ratio of the number of qualified events to the total number of flood events) of large flood events are above 94.7% at 1–5 h lead time and range from 84.2% to 89.5% at 6–10 h lead-time. For the large flood simulation, the small flood events can help the LSTM-FF model to explore a better rainfall-runoff relationship. The impact analysis of weights in the LSTM network structures shows that the discharge input plays a more obvious role in the 1-h LSTM network and the effect decreases with the lead-time. Meanwhile, in the adjacent lead-time, the LSTM networks explored a similar relationship between input and output. The study provides a new approach for flash flood forecasting and the highly accurate forecast contributes to prepare for and mitigate disasters.",

      "title": "Tuning the Bivariate Meta-Gaussian Distribution Conditionally in Quantifying Precipitation Prediction Uncertainty",
      "journal": "Forecasting",
      "citations": 3,
      "abstract": "One of the ways to quantify uncertainty of deterministic forecasts is to construct a joint distribution between the forecast variable and the observed variable; then, the uncertainty of the forecast can be represented by the conditional distribution of the observed given the forecast. The joint distribution of two continuous hydrometeorological variables can often be modeled by the bivariate meta-Gaussian distribution (BMGD). The BMGD can be obtained by transforming each of the two variables to a standard normal variable and the dependence between the transformed variables is provided by the Pearson correlation coefficient of these two variables. The BMGD modeling is exact provided that the transformed joint distribution is standard normal. In real-world applications, however, this normality assumption is hardly fulfilled. This is often the case for the modeling problem we consider in this paper: establish the joint distribution of a forecast variable and its corresponding observed variable for precipitation amounts accumulated over a duration of 24 h. In this case, the BMGD can only serve as an approximate model and the dependence parameter can be estimated in a variety of ways. In this paper, the effect of tuning this parameter is studied. Numerical simulations conducted suggest that, while the parameter tuning results in limited improvements in goodness-of-fit (GOF) for the BMGD as a bivariate distribution model, better results may be achieved by tuning the parameter for the one-dimensional conditional distribution of the observed given the forecast greater than a certain large value.",

      "citations": 35,
      "abstract": "The sub seasonal forecast horizon, with lead-times up to 7 weeks, has a number of possibilities for operational applications. This sub seasonal time scale is only recently motivated for research on applications, as it is often recognized as being in the gray zone of predictability in both meteorological and hydrological sciences. This work is one of the first assessments of ensemble sub seasonal meteorological inputs to large-scale basin hydrological modelling within a tropical climate – where it could benefit hydropower generation. The quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF) data were provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), within the sub seasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) project’s context. To assess the quality of the forecasts, a statistical evaluation was performed, including a comparison with the traditional extended streamflow prediction (ESP) technique. Results allowed for an estimation of the error magnitudes and the potential to the benefit of the ensemble over the deterministic reference forecast and the ESP approach. We showed that the sub seasonal QPF-based forecasts have advantages over the ESP, although, generally their skill deteriorates in lead times after day 30. The evaluation across multiple locations considering drainage area and hydrometeorological conditions, suggests that the statistical performance outcome is also spatio-temporal dependent.",

Streamflow is forecast from 1 to 8 d, forced with Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts from the US National Weather Service. Of the individual models, SWAT-VSA and the ANN provide better predictions of total streamflow (NSE 0.60–0.70) and peak flow, but underpredicted low flows. During the forecast period the ANN had the highest predictive power (NSE 0.44–0.64), however all three models underpredicted peak flow. The Bayesian ensemble forecast streamflow with the most skill for all forecast lead times (NSE 0.49–0.67) and provided a quantification of prediction uncertainty.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 236,
      "abstract": "Long lead-time streamflow forecasting is of great significance for water resources planning and management in both the short and long terms. Despite of some studies using machine learning methods in streamflow forecasting, only few studies have been conducted to explore long lead-time forecasting capabilities of these methods, and gain an insight into systematic comparison of model forecasting performance in both the short and long terms. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) and a long short term memory (LSTM), a powerful tool for learning long-term temporal dependencies and capturing nonlinear relationship, have been adopted to forecast streamflow at daily and monthly scales for a long lead-time period. For long lead-time streamflow forecasting, a recursive forecasting procedure, which takes the last one-step-ahead forecast as a new input for the next-step-ahead forecast, is used in the ANN and LSTM forecasting systems. Two models are trained and validated for streamflow forecasting using the rainfall and runoff datasets collected from the Nan River Basin and Ping River Basin, Thailand, covering the period 1974 to 2014. To further explore the impact of parameter settings on model performance, two parameters, i.e. the length of time lag and the number of maximum epochs, are examined in the ANN and LSTM models. The main findings are highlighted here. First, with an optimal setting up of model parameters, both the ANN and LSTM model can provide accurate daily forecasting (up to 20 days ahead). Second, in comparison to the ANN model, the LSTM model exhibits better model performance in long lead-time daily forecasting, but less satisfactory in multi-monthly forecasting due to lack of large monthly training dataset. Third, the selection of the length of the time lag and number of maximum epochs used in both ANN and LSTM modelling are the key for long lead-time streamflow forecasting at daily and monthly scales. These findings suggest that the LSTM could be advance in daily streamflow forecasting and thus would be helpful to assist in strategy decisions in water resource management.",

      "journal": "Journal of Cleaner Production",
      "citations": 49,
      "abstract": "Water scarcity is one of the most serious problems of the future due to increasing urbanization and water demand. Urban water planners need to balance increasing water demand with water resources that are under increasing pressure due to climate change and water pollution. Decision makers are forced to select the most appropriate water management alternative with respect to multiple, conflicting criteria based on short and long term projections of water demand in the future. In this paper, we consider water management in Istanbul, a megacity with a population of 15 million. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a method combining demand forecasting with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods to evaluate five different water supply alternatives with respect to seven criteria using opinions of experts and stakeholders from different sectors. Methodology To combine forecasting with MCDM, we design a data collection method in which we share our demand forecasts with our experts. For demand forecasting, we compare Holt-Winters, Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (S-ARIMA), and feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models and select S-ARIMA as the best forecasting model for monthly water consumption data. Generated demand projections are shared with experts from different sectors and collected data is evaluated with Fuzzy Theory using two distinct MCDM models: Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE). Also our analyses are complemented with two sensitivity analyses. Findings Our results indicate that greywater reuse is the best alternative to satisfy the growing water demand of the city whereas all experts find desalination and inter-basin water transfer as the least attractive solutions. In addition, we adopt the PROMETHEE GDSS procedure to obtain a GAIA plane indicating consensus among experts. Furthermore, we find that our results are moderately sensitive to the number of experts and they are insensitive to changes in experts’ evaluations. Novelty To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first one incorporating water demand and supply management concepts into the evaluation of alternatives. From a methodological perspective, water demand projections have never been used in an MCDM study in the literature. Also, this paper contributes to the literature with a mathematical construction of consensus and Monte Carlo simulations for the sufficiency of experts consulted in a study.",

      "journal": "Journal of Flood Risk Management",
      "citations": 7,
      "abstract": "Floods are among the most devastating natural disasters and are expected to become more severe with changing climate and population growth. Flood forecasting is one of the key components of flood risk reduction. The potential for seasonal flood forecasting through climate indexes has not been studied for West Africa so far. This work investigates how climate indicators can be used to predict in advance, one to several months ahead of the flood season, above or below normal flood discharge in West Africa. Six global and regional climate indexes were screened for their potential to predict flood discharge of 56 river gauging stations across West Africa. Forecasting models are developed, based on simple and multiple linear regressions between climate indexes and annual maximum discharge, and evaluated using the relative operating characteristics and the relative operating levels scores. The western dipole mode index is the most skillful individual climate index for above normal flood prediction. Combining climate indexes via multiple linear regressions outperforms individual climate indexes for both above and below normal flood prediction. The models show forecasting skills for up to 4 months prior to the flood season. Hence, this study opens promising possibilities for seasonal flood forecasting in West Africa. This may help alert disaster reduction agencies of entering a period of an increased chance of flooding and may trigger adequate mitigation measures.",

      "citations": 4,
      "abstract": "The effect of climate change on water resources has been an area of continued research, especially in Australia. Previous studies have suggested significant trends in rainfall, and these are amplified causing larger changes in streamflow. However, most of the previous analysis was based on annual time scales or modelled data and did not account for changes in land cover, which could interact with changes in climate. Climate data and streamflow data between 1970 and 2010 from 13 mostly forested small catchments (<250 km 2 ) in Australia were analysed for trends. Non‐parametric Mann‐Kendall trend analysis, generalized additive mixed modelling and rainfall‐runoff modelling were combined for the analysis. This indicates consistent increases in maximum temperature and varied decreases in rainfall. The streamflow in the studied catchments indicated small decreases in streamflow, which amplified observed trends in the rainfall. In general, overall decreases are much smaller than suggested in earlier research.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 14,
      "abstract": "Very little data is available on chemical weathering and its controlling factors in small catchments of the central Tibetan Plateau (TP) despite being the main part of the plateau. Hydrochemistry of river water in 24 small catchments in the Nam Co basin draining different strata and recharge forms was investigated monthly during the 2018 monsoon season. The results show that carbonate dissolution is the most important geochemical process controlling the evolution of hydrochemistry of most river water in the Nam Co basin (the average contribution to riverine solutes reaches 46%) even though its contribution shows significant spatial distribution: low values occur in some granite regions (e.g. 27% in H10) but is high in catchments where carbonate rocks are prevalent (e.g. 68% in H23). The contribution of silicate weathering is low, with an average of 11% in catchments located on the east and south banks draining sandstone/mudstone, while this value increases to 32% in catchments on the south bank which pass through granite, and on the west bank. The contribution of sulfide oxidation in most rivers on the south bank is unexpectedly high (40%) but is much lower in other rivers (13%). This spatial difference is attributed to the influence of topography, particularly slope. The carbonate weathering rate (CWR) in small catchments of the Nam Co basin shows spatial heterogeneity and is significantly and positively correlated with the lithologic coefficient which proposed to indicate the degree of rock weatherability and negatively correlated with mean slope and mean altitude. The spatial distribution of the silicate weathering rate (SWR) is not as significant as the CWR and is mainly governed by runoff depth. Chemical weathering rates in the glacierised catchments are 1.3 times higher than those in the non-glacierised regions which share similar lithology. Thus, glaciation enhances chemical weathering in the study area. The area-weighted average value of CWR and SWR in the study area is 23.2 t/km 2 /y and 5.2 t/km 2 /y, respectively. Chemical weathering rates in the Nam Co basin, central TP are relatively low when compared with those in catchments located on the edge of the TP, indicating the carbon sequestration effect caused by this supergene geological process in this area may be insignificant.",

      "citations": 14,
      "abstract": "Field-based fire studies in the equatorial Andes indicate that fires are strongly associated with biophysical and anthropogenic variables. However, fire controls and fire regimes at the regional scale remain undocumented. Therefore, this paper describes spatial and temporal burned-area patterns, identifies biophysical and anthropogenic fire drivers, and quantifies fire probability across 6° of latitude and 3° of longitude in the equatorial Andes. The spatial and temporal burned-area analysis was carried out based on 18 years (2001–2018) of the MCD64A1 MODIS burned-area product. Climate, topography, vegetation, and anthropogenic variables were integrated in a logistic regression model to identify the significance of explanatory variables and determine fire occurrence probability. A total of 5779 fire events were registered during the 18 years of this study, located primarily along the western cordillera of the Andes and spreading from North to South. Eighty-eight percent of these fires took place within two fire hotspots located in the northwestern and southwestern corners of the study area. Ninety-nine percent occurred during the second part of the year, between June and December. The largest density of fires was primarily located on herbaceous vegetation and shrublands. Results show that mean monthly temperature, precipitation and NDVI during the pre-fire season, the location of land cover classes such as forest and agriculture, distance to roads and urban areas, slope, and aspect were the most important determinants of spatial and temporal fire distribution. The logistic regression model achieved a good accuracy in predicting fire probability (80%). Probability was higher in the southwestern and northern corners of the study area, and lower towards the north in the western and eastern piedmonts of the Andes. This analysis contributes to the understanding of fires in mountains within the tropics. The results here presented have the potential to contribute to fire management and control in the region.",

We analyzed the impact of vegetation changes on blue water generation in a central Spanish Pyrenees basin undergoing intense afforestation. We found that vegetation change is a key driver of large decreases in blue water availability. The effect of vegetation increase is amplified during dry years, and mainly during the dry season, with streamflow reductions of more than 50%. This pattern can be attributed primarily to increased plant water consumption. Our findings highlight the importance of vegetation changes in reinforcing the decrease in water resource availability. With aridity expected to rise in southern Europe over the next few decades, interactions between climate and land management practices appear to be amplifying future hydrological drought risk in the region.",

      "citations": 18,
      "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) accounts for a substantial portion of regional water budgets in much of the southeast and fire-prone western United States (US). Even small changes in ET rates can translate to meaningful shifts in runoff patterns and makes forecasting the direction and magnitude of wildfire-induced ET alteration of critical importance. We use 1 km ET estimates from the operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) product for the conterminous US (CONUS) to evaluate post-fire ET and evaporation ratio (ET/P) shifts in the first five post-fire years in approximately 5500 unique fires. Pixels with similar ET/P responses to fire are grouped through k-means clustering and the resultant cluster distribution is explored over space and time. The largest changes in post-fire ET/P are observed in the southwestern CONUS where first-year ratios are reduced by 50 to 90% and pre-fire ratios are rarely recovered by post-fire year five. Regional and intra-fire ET/P response variability is also highest in the western CONUS where climatic, topographic, and ecologic gradients are steep. Post-fire ET/P modifications are small to negligible in the east-southeast CONUS, and 18% of all pixels analyzed exhibit small to moderate increases in post-fire year one ET/P. A comparison of burned and unburned pixel pairs confirms the role of fire in the shifts but also indicates a high degree of background variability in the ET and precipitation data. Although the biggest percent ET/P reductions occur in shrub/scrub landscapes in much of the west, the biggest magnitude ET changes often occur in evergreen forests. Higher burn severities are consistently correlated with greater post-fire ET/P reductions, while relationships between post-fire ET/P shifts and numerous other landscape attributes (e.g., pre-fire vegetation type) vary in both direction and magnitude in different parts of the CONUS. Further work can be conducted to refine controlling relationships within more homogeneous sub-regions.",

This increased use has created an opportunity to employ an emerging data-driven approach for wildfire risk estimation as an alternative to running computationally expensive simulations. In an investigative attempt, we propose a probability-based risk metric that gives a series of probability values for fires starting at any possible start location under any given weather condition falling into different categories. We investigate the validity of the proposed approach by applying it to use cases in Tasmania, Australia. Results show that the proposed risk metric can be a convenient and accurate method of estimating imminent risk during operational wildfire management.

Exploiting the horizontal GNSS observations, we estimate the vertical component of the deformation to provide the VLM for the entire 15,000‐km‐long coastline. The estimated vertical rates show large variability around the country as a result of volcanic, tectonic, and anthropogenic sources. Interseismic subsidence is observed in Kaikoura region supporting models of at least partial locking of the southern Hikurangi subduction interface. Despite data challenges in the mountainous regions from landslides, sediment compaction, and glaciers, InSAR data shows localized uplift of the Southern Alps.",

      "citations": 21,
      "abstract": "Recent increases in the incidences of wildfires have necessitated the development of methodologies to quantify the effect of these fires on streamflows. Climate variability has been cited as a major challenge in revealing the true contribution of disturbance to streamflow changes. To address this, we developed an annual Budyko “decomposition” method for (1) statistical change detection of hydrologic signatures post-fire, (2) separating climate-driven and fire-driven changes in streamflow, and (3) estimating hydrologic recovery timescales after fire. We demonstrate the use of this methodology for 17 watersheds in Southern California with high interannual variability in precipitation. We show that while traditional metrics like changes in flow or runoff ratio might not detect a disturbance effect due to confounding climate signals, the Budyko framework can be used successfully for statistical change detection. The Budyko approach was also found to be robust in detecting changes in 5 highly burned catchments (>40% burned area ratio), while changes in less burned (2) and unburned catchments (10) were insignificant. We further used the Budyko approach to quantify the contribution of fire-driven versus climate driven changes in streamflow and found that fire contributed to an average increase in streamflow on the order of 80 mm yr −1 , though the effect varied greatly between years. Finally, we estimated hydrologic recovery timescales that varied between 5 and 45 years for four burned catchments. We found a significant linear relationship between recovery time and burned area at medium and high severity for our study catchments, with about 4 years of recovery time per 10% of the watershed burned.",

      "abstract": "Fires increasingly impact forested watersheds, with uncertain water resources impacts. While research has revealed higher peak flows, longer‐term yields may increase or decrease following fire, and the mechanisms regulating post‐fire streamflow are little explored. Hydrologic response to disturbance is poorly understood in the Lower Colorado River Basin (LCRB), where snowmelt often occurs before the growing season. Here, we quantify annual streamflow changes following what have been, before 2020, two of the largest wildfires in the modern history of the contiguous United States. We evaluate nine nested watersheds with >50 years records within the Salt River Basin to evaluate fire impact over ranges of elevation, climate, vegetation, burned area, and spatial scale. We employ double‐mass comparison of paired watersheds, pre‐ and post‐fire runoff ratio comparison, multiple linear regression of climate and fire, and time‐trend analysis. Precipitation and streamflow are decoupled during dry periods; therefore we conduct separate change detection for wet and dry periods. Post‐fire summer streamflow increased by 24%–38% at all elevations. While winter/spring streamflow remained constant in the highest, coldest headwaters, winter flows declined in lower‐elevation headwaters. As a result, basin annual streamflow declined. These results support emerging understanding that warm semiarid watersheds respond differently to disturbance than well‐studied, colder watersheds. Asynchrony between winter snowmelt and summer evaporative demand is likely important when considering long‐term impacts of forest management and disturbance on water supply in the LCRB.",

While there are many studies in Australia about the effects of individual wildfires on streamflow at fine scales ( 25%. No influence of fire was found in the long-term (15–20 years after the wildfire) runoff ratio. We found that wildfire regime, measured by TSF, explained ∼8.8% of the variation in annual streamflow across the Australian temperate zone, and that with decreasing TSF (i.e., increased wildfire impact), the average streamflow increased. Streamflow variation explained by wildfire regimes varied with hydroclimate. The explained variance of streamflow by wildfire regimes in semi-arid catchments (23%) and dry sub-humid catchments (13%) were higher than humid catchments (5%). Our results provide a broad-scale understanding of how wildfire regimes influence streamflow variability at broad temporal and spatial scales, and provided important context and baseline information for determining the implications of changes in climate and fire regimes for regional water availability.",

      "abstract": "Ecological restoration efforts at scale have been shown to play an important role in reducing human impact on the environment, improving climate change adaptation and halting extinctions globally. Upscaling restoration efforts requires funding, and therefore evidence of the benefits of restoration is needed. This study aims to contribute towards addressing these gaps by: (1) bolstering the evidence base of the water-related impacts of investment into ecological restoration by improving the methods of predicting the streamflow impacts of alien tree clearing; and (2) exploring the potential size of the variability in catchment responses at a fine-scale (60x60 m) in one particular region by comparing four different neighbouring catchments. We model the impacts on streamflow in four strategic water providing catchments using the fully-distributed MIKE-SHE modelling tool. We find that the benefits of clearing mature infestations of alien trees, such as pines, from naturally tree-less ecosystems can increase available surface water resources by 15.1 to 29.5%. Clearing riparian invasions is predicted to have a 1.7 times greater impact compared to terrestrial (non-riparian) invasions. The largest modelled impact of restoration on streamflow is on the mid to low flows, and this impact is greater in dry years relative to wet years. The findings are novel in that they shed light on the types of spatial uncertainties that can be expected in modelled gains, with implications for generalisation. These findings are important for leveraging investment to upscale restoration efforts in water scarce regions, as they suggest improved water security during the dry season and droughts. Upscaling efforts is essential if the degradation of ecosystems globally is to be prevented, halted and reversed, as proposed by the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.",

Gauged pre/post-fire hourly discharges were used to assess actual pre/post-fire hydrological conditions. To remove the weather variability effect, daily pre/post-fire discharges were simulated under the same weather conditions. An eco-hydraulic model was employed to calculate flow velocities, water depths and macroinvertebrate habitat suitability at various discharges across a 165 m long reach. The fire increased the magnitude and frequency of peak velocities and depths by 6.5–475%. Increased post-fire rainfall exacerbated hydrological-hydraulic extremes. However, the short duration of post-fire extremes led to small impacts on the habitat suitability for macroinvertebrates, which were stressed for a maximum 18.4% of the time after the fire (350 days in five years). In small Mediterranean-climate headwaters, after wildfires, less frequent streamflow becomes more frequent, high and of short duration. Macroinvertebrates largely resist such short-term, low-magnitude hydrological-hydraulic changes.",

      "citations": 25,
      "abstract": "The greening of the Arctic and pan-Arctic regions in recent decades has been widely confirmed, while the details regarding the greening feedback effects involving the water and energy cycles are still vague. Evapotranspiration (ET), a vital process in the water and energy cycles, strongly corresponds to vegetation activities. Hence, in this study, we chose Siberia as the study area and, based on the Penman–Monteith–Leuning (PML) model, revealed the contribution of greening to ET. Moreover, the effects of the water vapour pressure deficit, surface net radiation (R n) and wind speed (U m) on ET were evaluated. The results indicated that from 2000 to 2020, the annual ET in Siberia was 248.2±94.1 mm, and the trend was 0.54±1.38 mm/a. Greening was the major driver of ET variations; its contribution was 0.79±0.76 mm/a, and its relative contribution was 37%. Among the other analysed climate factors, ET was sensitive to R n and U m; these factors contributed 0.51±0.85 mm/a and− 0.38±0.54 mm/a, respectively, to ET variation, and their relative contributions were 33% and 19%, respectively. The effect of the water vapour pressure deficit was slight (0.29±0.22 mm/a, 11%), indicating that ET was hardly constrained by the water supply in Siberia. These results quantify the importance of greening on ET variations and highlight the important effects of R n and U m on ET in cold region terrestrial ecosystems. Furthermore, this study improves our understanding of the mechanism by which evapotranspiration varies and is valuable for predicting and evaluating the Arctic water cycle in “Arctic amplification”.",

Because actual evapotranspiration (ETa) constitutes the largest loss in the terrestrial water budget, it has been suggested that fire-induced ETa reduction is a primary driver of elevated post-fire discharge. Ten gaged watersheds with burns exceeding 5% of their total contributing drainage area were selected from California, Oregon, Montana, Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. Continuous daily stream gage data were compiled, and 30-meter ETa estimates were calculated with the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model. Fire-induced ETa shifts were quantified with statistical tests that compared pre and post-fire monthly ETa in burned and unburned pixels; the dampening effect of scale was also evaluated by repeating tests on all pixels from the entire basin. As streamflow data are point measurements that aggregate a large spatial area, additional statistical methods were required to isolate the effect of fire from climate on baseflow and runoff. Key findings include a) significant fire-induced ETa reductions were only distinguishable in basin-scale monthly datasets when at least 73% of the basin burned, b) the effect of wildfire disturbance on streamflow magnitude was seasonably variable, c) streamflow was modified in basins with as little as 6% burned drainage area; however, shifts only persisted beyond the fifth post-fire year where more than three-quarters of the basin was fire-impacted, and d) surplus water from ETa reduction was sufficient to account for boosted fire-induced streamflow. Where fire-induced streamflow increases were not significantly correlated with ETa anomaly, other fire-impacted landscape processes may have contributed to modified runoff generation and routing. Where fire reduced ETa but streamflow shifts were not detected, compensatory ETa pathways may have consumed the excess water before it reached the gage. Findings suggest that water providers with small source-water collection areas have higher relative risk for fire-induced hydromodification than providers with larger or more diversified supply portfolios. Results also illustrate the tendency of overarching climate signals to mask or artificially boost the apparent effect of landscape disturbance on streamflow at the basin outlet.",

      "abstract": "Forest fires caused by the extreme temperature brought on by climate change are the source of problems such as flood disasters and erosion in terms of changing the natural soil cover in that region. In this study, the effects of soil loss and flooding caused by the fire disaster that occurred in the Icmeler town of Marmaris, one of the world's most popular touristic cities, were investigated. The study was carried out under three main methods. First, the affected terrain was determined by remote sensing methods. Then, soil loss was investigated by RUSLE method using satellite images after the fire disaster. Finally, using the SCS-CN precipitation-flow model method, the impact of the land change brought on by the fires on the flood magnitudes was investigated. As a result of the study, it was determined that the land change caused by the fires caused problems such as the increase in soil losses in the region as well as the increase in the size of the floods. After forest fires, the land should be afforested, terraced and the rainfall should be well drained.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Research",
      "citations": 116,
      "abstract": "Wildfires have increased in frequency in many ecosystems, with implications for human health and the environment, including water quality. Increased fire frequency and urbanization also raise the prospect of fires burning into urban areas, mobilizing pollutants few have considered to date. As a result, water quality managers lack information to anticipate, respond to and potentially mitigate wildfire impacts. Here, we reviewed the scientific literature to assess wildfire effects on response endpoints of a conceptual model linking fire to water quality, quantifying response directionality, magnitude and duration. Physically, water yield, sediments, and temperature all increased post‐fire. Chemically, nutrients, ions, organic chemicals, and metals increased in burned watersheds, sometimes by orders of magnitude over pre‐fire or reference conditions. In select cases, post‐fire concentrations exceeded aquatic life criteria or drinking water standards, at times even in the finished drinking water. Biological assemblages commonly declined after post‐fire runoff events. The duration of effects was less than 5 yr for most endpoints (e.g., metals) on average following fire, although effects did extend 15 yr or more in some individual cases. We found only a few studies on pollutants mobilized from wildfire impacted urban areas with benzene contamination in drinking water and high metal concentrations in ash prominent exceptions. Overall, this review provides a resource for understanding wildfire impacts on water quality endpoints, with the goal of informing the response of managers and other decision makers to this growing problem.",

      "journal": "Dissertation",
      "citations": 1,
      "abstract": "This thesis covers three major topics related to wildfires, remote sensing and meteorology:(i) quantifying and forecasting fire danger combining numerical weather forecasts and satellite observations of fire intensity;(ii) mapping burned areas from satellite observations with multiple spatial and spectral resolution; and (iii) modelling fire progression taking into account weather conditions and fuel (vegetation) availability. Regarding the first topic, an enhanced Fire Weather Index (FWI) is proposed by using statistical methods to combine the classical FWI with an atmospheric instability index with the aim of better forecasting the fire danger conditions favourable to the development of convective fires. Furthermore, the daily definition of the classical FWI was extended to an hourly timescale, allowing for assessment of the variability of the fire danger conditions throughout the day. For the second topic, a method is proposed to map and date burned areas using sequences of daily satellite data. This method, tested over several regions around the globe, provide burned area maps that outperform other existing methods for the task, particularly regarding the consistency and accuracy of the date of burning. Furthermore, a method is proposed for fast assessment of burned areas using 10-meter resolution satellite data and making use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a tool for preprocessing and downloading of data that is then used as input to a deep learning model that combines a coarse burned area map with the medium resolution data to provide a refined burned area map with 10-meter resolution at event level and with low computational requirements. Finally, for the third topic, a method is proposed to estimate the fire progression over a 12-hour period with resource to an ensemble of models trained based on the reconstruction of past events. Overall, I am confident that the results obtained and presented in this thesis provide a significant contribution to the remote sensing and wildfires scientific community while opening interesting paths for future research on the topics described.",

      "abstract": "CoastSat is an open-source software toolkit written in Python that enables the user to obtain time-series of shoreline position at any sandy coastline worldwide from 30+ years (and growing) of publicly available satellite imagery. The toolkit exploits the capabilities of Google Earth Engine to efficiently retrieve Landsat and Sentinel-2 images cropped to any user-defined region of interest. The resulting images are pre-processed to remove cloudy pixels and enhance spatial resolution, before applying a robust and generic shoreline detection algorithm. This novel shoreline detection technique combines a supervised image classification and a sub-pixel resolution border segmentation to map the position of the shoreline with an accuracy of ~10 m. The purpose of CoastSat is to provide coastal managers, engineers and scientists a user-friendly and practical toolkit to monitor and explore their coastlines. The software is freely-available on GitHub (https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat) and is accompanied by guided examples (Jupyter Notebook) plus step-by-step README documentation.",

      "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment",
      "citations": 113,
      "abstract": "Mapping and monitoring of indicators of soil cover, vegetation structure, and various native and non-native species is a critical aspect of rangeland management. With the advancement in satellite imagery as well as cloud storage and computing, the capability now exists to conduct planetary-scale analysis, including mapping of rangeland indicators. Combined with recent investments in the collection of large amounts of in situ data in the western U.S., new approaches using machine learning can enable prediction of surface conditions at times and places when no in situ data are available. However, little analysis has yet been done on how the temporal relevancy of training data influences model performance. Here, we have leveraged the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest, after comparison with other candidates) to identify the potential impact of different sampling times (across months and years) on estimation of rangeland indicators from the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) and Landscape Monitoring Framework (LMF) programs. Our results indicate that temporally relevant training data improves predictions, though the training data need not be from the exact same month and year for a prediction to be temporally relevant. Moreover, inclusion of training data from the time when predictions are desired leads to lower prediction error but the addition of training data from other times does not contribute to overall model error. Using all of the available training data can lead to biases, toward the mean, for times when indicator values are especially high or low. However, for mapping purposes, limiting training data to just the time when predictions are desired can lead to poor predictions of values outside the spatial range of the training data for that period. We conclude that the best Random Forest prediction maps will use training data from all possible times with the understanding that estimates at the extremes will be biased.",

      "abstract": "Vegetation dynamics and their response to climate change is critical for determining the mechanisms of climate-derived variations in terrestrial ecosystems. Here, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and monthly temperature and precipitation data were employed to examine the spatiotemporal patterns in vegetation dynamics and investigate the time-lag effects of vegetation responses to climate variables in the Yamzhog Yumco Basin, South Tibet, during 2000–2018. The results reveal that the annual average growing season NDVI in the basin was 0.28, with lower values in the mountainous regions and higher values broadly distributed in the lake and river zones. An increasing NDVI trend was observed in nearly 62% of the total vegetation area, with significant changes observed in the western and southern boundaries of the basin. The vegetation areas in the eastern part of basin exhibited a decreasing NDVI trend. The growing season NDVI was positively correlated with temperature and precipitation, with temperature being the primary driving factor for vegetation growth across the entire basin. The cumulative temperature and precipitation of the current and previous months had the strongest impact on NDVI variations. The correlation coefficients between the NDVI, and temperature and precipitation were greater than 0.6 in approximately 72% and 60% of the vegetation area, respectively, with Lag 0–1 accounting for most of these larger correlation coefficients. Future development targets for grassland conservation projects, such as the reasonable livestock capacity, should consider the time-lag effects on vegetation dynamics.",

      "journal": "Forest Ecology and Management",
      "citations": 12,
      "abstract": "In Japan, there has recently been an increasing call for forest thinning to conserve water resources from forested mountain catchments in terms of runoff during prolonged drought periods of the year. How their water balance and the resultant runoff are altered by forest thinning is examined using a combination of 8-year hydrological observations, 100-year meteorological data output that is generated using a stochastic model, and a semi-process-based rainfall-runoff model. The rainfall-runoff model is developed based on TOPMODEL assuming that forest thinning has an impact on runoff primarily through an alteration in canopy interception. The main novelty in this analysis is that the availability of the generated 100-year meteorological data allows the investigations of the forest thinning impacts on mountain catchment water resources under the most severe drought conditions. The model is validated against runoff observations conducted at a forested mountain catchment in the Kanto region of Japan for the period 2010–2017. It is demonstrated that the model reproduces temporal variations in runoff and evapotranspiration at inter- and intra-annual time scales, and the flow duration curves were well reproduced. On the basis of projected flow duration curves for the 100-year, despite the increase in an annual total runoff with thinning, low flow rates (the flows within the range of >70% time exceedance) in both dry and normal years (the years in which low flow are the lowest and 50th the lowest) were impacted by the forest thinning to a lesser extent. Simulations also showed that low flows would increase more with higher catchment water retention capacity, and higher catchment water retention capacity would enhance the forest thinning effect on increasing available water resources. This study would be helpful in planning for better forest management considering runoff from forested catchments.",

      "abstract": "Groundwater depth has complex non-linear relationships with climate, groundwater extraction, and surface water flows. To understand the importance of each predictor and predictand (groundwater depth), different artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been used. In this research, we have proposed a Deep Learning (DL) model to predict groundwater depths. The DL model is an extension of the conventional neural network with multiple layers having non-linear activation function. The feasibility of the DL model is assessed with well-established framework models [Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)]. The area selected for this study is Konan basin located in the Kochi Prefecture of Japan. The hydro-meteorological and groundwater data used are precipitation, river stage, temperature, recharge and groundwater depth. Identical set of inputs and outputs of all the selected stations were used to train and validate the models. The predictive accuracy of the DL, ELM and GPR models has been assessed considering suitable goodness-of-fit criteria. During training period, the DL model has a very good agreement with the observed data ( RMSE = 0.04, r = 0.99 and NSE = 0.98) and during validation period, its performance is satisfactory ( RMSE = 0.08, r = 0.95 and NSE = 0.87). To check practicality and generalization ability of the DL model, it was re-validated at three different stations (E2, E3 and E6) of the same unconfined aquifer. The significant prediction capability and generalization ability makes the proposed DL model more reliable and robust. Based on the finding of this research, the DL model is an intelligent tool for predicting groundwater depths. Such advanced AI technique can save resources and labor conventionally employed to estimate various features of complex groundwater systems.",

      "abstract": "A clear identification of the hydrochemical processes in groundwater systems is critical for the management and protection of alternative water resources. The Dagu River Basin (DRB) has become one of the most concerning areas due to the typical geographical conditions and intensive human disturbance. In this study, the spatio-temporal variations of groundwater hydrochemical characteristics were discriminated based on the self-organizing maps (SOM) clustering results from 2001 to 2017. Simultaneously, their main governing factors were also identified according to the composite properties of hydrogen and oxygen isotopic evidence, hydrochemical facies evolution diagram (HFE-D), chloro-alkaline indices (CAI) values, and the enrichment of nitrogen. Analysis results indicated that the long-term evolution of hydrochemical signatures basically conformed to the trends of rising in the dry season and falling in the rainy season. Total dissolved solids (TDS) fluctuated from 187.90 mg/L to 2294.81 mg/L, with an average of 881.77 mg/L. Moreover, the nitrate concentrations in the river basin varied significantly from 0.70 mg/L to 605.32 mg/L. The unconfined aquifer beneath DRB was experiencing freshening gradually, while some other samples were still subjected to the interference of environmental pollution. Spatio-temporal variations in the respective clusters demonstrated that natural factors including precipitation infiltration, evaporation, and water–rock interactions played vital roles in the samples of Clusters I-III, V, and VIII, while the samples of Cluster VII were influenced by seawater intrusion; and those of Clusters IV and VI were mainly affected by nitrate and nitrite contamination. This study suggests that the SOM connected with stable isotope analysis, HFE-Diagram, CAI values, and correlation analysis could be successfully used to interpret nonlinear and high-dimensional multivariate systems and provide supplementary information about the dominant mechanisms controlling the regional groundwater evolution.",

      "abstract": "Groundwater potential (GWP) mapping of an area is the initial stage of assessing groundwater for further investigation leading towards exploitation of the resources to meet the water demand for various sectors. Groundwater availability is explicitly important especially in the mountainous area in the Himalayan region. In practice, different combinations of parameters are used to prepare GWP map, however, the sensitivity of parameters are poorly assessed. This paper aims to evaluate the sensitivity of parameter for delineating groundwater potential using GIS and remote sensing. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) technique is used to prepare groundwater potential map of Khadadevi-Manthali area, Ramechhap district, of Bagmati Province, Nepal. Nine influencing parameters are considered in the present analysis, which were integrated through assigning normalized weight to the thematic layers and their classes using Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). Further, groundwater potential maps have been prepared for 7 different cases using different combination of parameters and for each case, the results were successively validated with 21 springs and 3 tube wells spatially distributed within the study area. The results show that the GWP maps prepared using the lineament and hydro-geomorphic maps yield better result. The ROC/AUC Curve (Receiver operating characteristic curve/Area under curve) for GWP map prepared using 9 parameters shows higher prediction accuracy (72.4%) as compared to other cases\\. Thus, we conclude that lineament and hydro-geomorphology of an area are most influencing factors in delineating GWP zones in mountainous area of Himalayan region and the nine parameters considered in the present study can be applied in also other areas of the region for preparing GWP map.",

      "citations": 10,
      "abstract": "The steady overexploitation of the Ogallala Aquifer underlying the U.S. High Plains Region has put irrigated crop production at risk, particularly in the Southern and Central High Plains. To manage this issue properly, a data-driven modeling framework is developed and tested that is fast to employ and yet provides reliable long-term groundwater level (GWL) forecasts as a function of climatological and anthropogenic factors. The modeling framework uses the random forests (RF) technique in combination with ordinary kriging, and is tested in Finney County in southwest Kansas. The introduction of groundwater withdrawal potential as a new surrogate for pumping intensity enables the RF model to capture decline in groundwater depletion rate as the system progresses towards aquifer depletion and/or as a result of well retirement policies. The RF model is executed from 2017 to 2099 for 20 different downscaled global climate models (GCMs) for the two representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios of 4.5 and 8.5. The results show the aquifer will cease to support irrigated agriculture in most of the county by 2060 under status quo management and average climate conditions. Moreover, climate will likely shift the aquifer’s depletion time frame by 15 years or less in most of the study area. The long-term combined impact of well retirement plans and climate conditions on groundwater depletion trends imply well retirement policies do not lead to sustained groundwater savings. This study demonstrates the capacity of machine learning models to serve as a rapid assessment tool, informing policymakers about future groundwater availability in intensively irrigated regions and under different climate and management conditions.",

      "citations": 49,
      "abstract": "This study presents a new concept that integrates the index-overlay method and a physical-based numerical model for predicting groundwater sustainability under various climate conditions and anthropogenic activities. The index-overlay DRASTIC method was modified with an analytical hierarchy process theory and employed to create groundwater vulnerability maps for the Pingtung plain groundwater basin in southern Taiwan. The physical-based MODFLOW model was used for predicting the dynamics of a basin-scale groundwater system. Solutions and calibrated hydrogeological parameters in the MODFLOW model provide feedback to the factors in the modified DRASTIC method which enables predicting groundwater vulnerability. In this study, different climate conditions were considered in the numerical model to obtain the changes in depth of water and net recharge for predicting future groundwater vulnerability and for evaluating the current state of the sustainability indicators. Results show that the depth of water and net recharge obtained from the groundwater model improve the accuracy of the groundwater vulnerability prediction. The variations of future climate conditions have less influence on the variations of groundwater vulnerability because of the dense river network that controls the shallow groundwater levels in the Pingtung plain groundwater basin. Therefore, the influence of climate conditions on the risk of groundwater contamination is also relatively low. Based on the analysis of the sustainability indicators, we found that the groundwater resource system in the Pingtung plain groundwater basin is in a critical condition of high vulnerability.",

      "abstract": "The advent of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has opened the doors for remote monitoring of gravitational changes and its derivatives across the globe, but received less attention due to poor spatial and temporal representation. Statistical models of varying complexity are commonly employed to downscale the GRACE datasets for use with local to regional applications. This study presents the application of two commonly employed machine learning models, multi-linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF), in spatially downscaling (from 1° to 0.25°) the GRACE-derived terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) by establishing a correlation with various land surface and hydroclimatic variables. The downscaled TWSA was further converted into groundwater storage anomalies. Applicability of the proposed methods was tested on four contrasting hydrogeological basins of India. For each basin, the significant predictor variables were considered to establish the relations. Seasonal groundwater levels observed in 236 wells during 2006–2015 were used for method validation and accuracy assessment. We observed a close match between GRACE-derived groundwater levels and the measurements for three of the four basins (r = 0.40–0.92, Root mean square error (RMSE) = 3.6–10.5 cm). Our results indicate that the predictor variables to downscale TWSA should be considered cautiously based on the hydrogeological, topographical, and meteorological characteristics of the basin.",

      "citations": 83,
      "abstract": "Northwestern India has been identified as a significant hotspot of groundwater depletion, with major implications for groundwater sustainability caused by excessive abstraction. We know relatively little about the detailed spatial and temporal changes in groundwater storage in this region, nor do we understand the interplay of factors controlling these changes. Groundwater managers and policymakers in India require such information to monitor groundwater development and make strategic decisions for the sustainable management of groundwater. Here, we characterise high-resolution spatio-temporal variability in groundwater levels and storage change across northwestern India through analysis of in situ measurements of historical groundwater level data. We note a slow gain in groundwater storage of + 0.58 ± 0.35 km 3 for the pre-monsoon and + 0.40 ± 0.35 km 3 for the post-monsoon period between 1974 and 2001. However, from 2002 to 2010, groundwater storage was rapidly depleted by −32.30 ± 0.34 km 3 in the pre-monsoon and −24.42 ± 0.34 km 3 in the post-monsoon period. Importantly, we observe marked spatial heterogeneity in groundwater levels and storage change and distinct hotspots of groundwater depletion with lateral length scales of tens of kilometers. Spatial variability in groundwater abstraction partially explains the depletion pattern, but we also find that the sedimentological heterogeneity of the aquifer system correlates broadly with long-term patterns of groundwater-level change. This correlation, along with the spatial agreement between groundwater level change and water quality, provides a framework for anticipating future depletion patterns and guiding groundwater monitoring and domain-specific management strategies.",

      "journal": "Agricultural Water Management",
      "citations": 49,
      "abstract": "In arid regions, water resources are under immense pressure and multiple stresses. Excessive use of water resources without proper management occurs in the present situation, and it will be intensified under future climate change conditions. Finding a good strategy for water resources management is essential to preserve sustainability in such watersheds. In this study, the first purpose is to optimize water use for the agricultural crops in the Eshtehard watershed in Iran, where the aquifer is a strategic resource for irrigated agriculture and is facing intensive drawdown because of over-extraction. A hydro-agronomic simulation-optimization approach is used for agronomy and groundwater management in which the agricultural production and water level variation are simulated by linking SWAT and MODFLOW, and the optimal crops pattern is searched for by the PSO algorithm. The crops’ area and their irrigation water consumption are the decision variables with the objective of maximizing the net benefit gained from the crops’ yield while the groundwater drawdown is limited to a pre-defined stability level. For the following purpose, the climate change impact on the optimal crop pattern across the watershed under two representative concentration pathways scenarios (RCPs 2.6 and 8.5) downscaled by the data of the HadGEM2-ES General Circulation Model for the near future is evaluated. Results show that irreparable damage to groundwater depletion is reduced in the optimum state, and lower stress is imposed on the aquifer under the climate change impacts by executing the optimum crop pattern. To see this, a part of the winter wheat and cotton crops’ area must be replaced by winter barley. Also, the crop’s irrigation amount must be decreased for winter wheat, winter barley and cotton by 45%, 7%, and 10%, respectively, which reduces groundwater extraction in the optimum situation.",

Results show a negative relationship of rainfall, RHmax/RHmin, and SW and a positive relationship of the remaining variables with groundwater. Elasticities demonstrate that a 1% change in SW (rainfall), major contributors, results in a decrease by 0.64% (0.55%) in groundwater in Bahawalpur (Multan). A 1% change in population (NTW), major consumers, results in an increase by 0.74% (0.70%) in depth to water table (DWT) across Jhang (Khanewal). The vulnerability map shows that high and very high vulnerability classes account for more than 50% of the total area of Punjab.",

      "abstract": "Groundwater is vital in Chennai Metropolitan Area, and thus its sustainable management is essential. This study aims to estimate groundwater recharge in the Chennai River basin (CRB) using an empirical method, a rainfall infiltration factor (RIF) method, a geographical information system (GIS)-distributed model, and the water table fluctuation (WTF) method. The average recharge estimates were 196 mm/year (empirical), 127 mm/year (WTF), and 122 mm/year (RIF). These results agree with the estimate of the GIS-distribution model, where 59% of the area has high recharge (>100 mm/year). The effective recharge from rainfall was around 10% with the RIF and WTF methods and 16% using the empirical method. All the estimates were statistically significant with confidence levels of over 98%, using a 95% confidence interval. The WTF method (with a 99.9% confidence level) was the most reliable of the four approaches. However, we suggest using multiple methods to cross-check the results and that measuring rainfall and water level is necessary for accurate recharge estimates in the future.",

      "abstract": "The gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) has emerged as a crucial source of land water storage information in hydrological analysis and research. Numerous factors contribute to regional terrestrial water storage (TWS), resulting in a complex mechanism. In the Loess Plateau region, the continuous alteration of natural conditions and profound impact of human activities have posed a serious threat to the natural ecosystem, leading to an escalating trend of TWS reduction. Addressing the specific analysis of how natural conditions and human activities affect TWS represents a pressing issue. This study employed the residual analysis method to discern the contribution rates of natural conditions and human activities, elucidated the spatial and temporal changes associated with each factor, and ascertained their individual influence. The findings indicated that TWS on the Loess Plateau exhibited a downward trend of −4.89 mm·a −1 from 2003 to 2017. The combined effects of climate change and human activities accounted for alterations in water resource reserves across most areas of the Loess Plateau, with human activities predominantly driving these changes. Precipitation emerged as the primary natural factor influencing TWS variations, and NDVI demonstrated a positive feedback effect on TWS at approximately 30%. Substantial spatial disparities in TWS existed within the Loess Plateau, with human activities identified as the primary cause for the decreasing trend. Vegetation restoration plays a positive role in saving water resources in the Loess Plateau to some extent, and vegetation growth exceeding the regional load will lead to water shortage.",

      "journal": "International Journal of Climatology",
      "citations": 15,
      "abstract": "This study examines the European heatwaves' predictability at subseasonal timescales. Land surface feedbacks and tropical convection, due to their variability at intraseasonal timescales, are taken into consideration and their potential role in extending the predictability beyond the medium range (10 days) is explored. A classification of European heatwaves into five heatwave types is used to discriminate the effects of surface feedbacks and of tropical variability among the different heatwave types. The classification is computed in terms of circulation patterns. By inferring the near‐surface temperature through atmospheric circulation, we aim to identify the predictable component of the heatwave events. All five heatwave circulation patterns are characterized by persistent anticyclonic anomalies located over the region with maximum temperatures. We show that soil moisture deficit is not a required precondition for the occurrence of heatwaves over most of Europe. However, heatwave events over southern Europe exhibit some sensitivity to dry conditions. We use a simplified index to describe the dominant mode of tropical convection at intraseasonal timescales. The index, based on precipitation anomalies, represents the evolution of the Boreal Summer Intraseasonal Oscillation (BSISO). We find that episodes with strong BSISO amplitudes characterized by enhanced convection over India, Bay of Bengal and China sea favour the occurrence of heatwave events over Russia. The results highlight the role of tropical intraseasonal variability in enhancing the predictability of some extreme temperature events over Europe.",

      "abstract": "Compound drought and heatwaves (CDH) have garnered increasing attention because concurrent extreme events can exacerbate the harmful impacts caused by univariate extremes. However, various severities in CDH events and their relationships with sea surface temperature (SST) variations in China remain little understood. Here, we accurately identify CDH events and multi-aspect of characteristics using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and the excess heat factor (EHF) during the extended summer (May–September) of 1961–2017. The evolution of multifaceted characteristics of CDH and their association with SST variation are further explored. The results suggest that the number, frequency, duration and intensity of regional CDH events show heterogeneous spatial patterns, with a significant increasing trend. A consistent abrupt transition in CDH characteristics averaged over China occurred in the period of 1993–1996. Mild and moderate CDHs occur more commonly in Northwest and North China, whereas severe CDHs are mainly found in central and eastern regions. Mild and moderate CDHs are more susceptible to SST modes than severe CDH, and there are strong positive correlations between mild and moderate CDH characteristics and SST variations in the northwest and northern regions. Compared to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) plays a dominant role in the intensifications of mild and moderate CDH events. Regionally, the northwest and north have experienced longer, more frequent and severe CDH events during the positive phase of IOD. These findings reveal the divergent evolutions in CDH characteristics with various severities and inconsistent impacts of different SST modes on the compound events.",

      "abstract": "Previous heat risk assessments have limitations in obtaining accurate heat hazard sources and capturing population distributions, which change over time. This study proposes a diurnal heat risk assessment framework incorporating spatiotemporal air temperature and real-time population data. Daytime and nighttime heat risk maps were generated using hazard, exposure, and vulnerability components in Seoul during the summer of 2018. The hazard was derived from the daily extreme air temperatures obtained using the stacking machine learning model. Exposure was calculated using de facto population density, and vulnerability was assessed using demographic and socioeconomic indicators. The resulting maps revealed distinct diurnal spatial patterns, with high-risk areas in the urban core during the day and dispersed at night. Daytime heat risk was strongly correlated with heat-related illness ratios (R = 0.8) and accurately captured temporal fluctuations in heat-related illness incidence. The proposed framework can guide site-specific adaptation and response plans for dynamic urban heat events.",

What are recent trends of extreme temperatures? Has the risk for a 100-year heatwave event increased in Northern Europe? We apply the UNSEEN (UNprecedented Simulated Extremes using ENsembles) approach to assess the credibility of the model ensemble and use non-stationary extreme value analysis to quantify recent trends in extreme 3-day heatwaves in late spring and early summer (May to July). We find significant non-stationarity and positive trends in annual maximum heatwave intensity. We also show that heatwave volatility, ie the risk of clearly outstanding heatwaves, is highest in central Scandinavia.",

      "abstract": "Heat stress and flood impacts have been extensively studied separately because of their significant societal and economic impacts, albeit apart from each other. Here we show that heat stress can trigger floods across large areas of North and South America, southern Africa, Asia and eastern Australia. We also show that the compounding of heat stress and floods is projected to worsen under climate change. This effect is magnified as we move from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 1–2.6 to 5–8.5. Moreover, in the future, the compounding between heat stress and floods is projected to extend to Europe and Russia, two areas where it has not been identified as relevant in the past. Moreover, by intersecting our results with future projections of the population of urban agglomerations, we find that heat stress/flood compound can pose a serious risk to a large portion of the world population. These results highlight the need towards improved preparation and mitigation measures that account for the compound nature of heat stress and flooding, and how the compounding is expected to be exacerbated because of climate change.",

In its downstream part located Ain Sefra city where wadi Ain Sefra (junction of wadi Breidj and Tirkount) takes place. It crosses the completely urbanized areas where it was liable to many inundations causing lots of losses either economic or loss of life, these damages resulted from growth population and the spreading of the city over the natural space of this wadi. In this paper, the methodological approach adopted, focused on the hydrologic modeling through the Hydrologic Engineering Center’s Hydrologic Modeling System and the hydraulic modeling under the Hydrologic Engineering Center’s River Analysis System with combination of Watershed Modeling System model and Geographic Information System. The aim of this study is to analyze the inundation behavior of Ain Sefra city during extreme flood events by considering concrete retaining walls existence built by local authorities and without it. In this case, three types of simulation are performed with the return periods of 10, 100, and 1000 years. The hydraulic modeling revealed that the existence of retaining walls resulted in decrease of flood zone area, and so much less lands are endangered by floods, so that damages of flood at the study area decrease clearly, but they still been insufficient for all return periods. The simulations also highlighted that the region most affected by the flood is the downtown area. Finally, a protection concept is proposed to ensure a better passage of floods in Ain Sefra city, to reduce the risk and to protect the city against the floods.",

The implementation of the 2007/60/ EC Directive, which aims, among other things, to assess and manage flood risk, is currently being carried out by means of rough hydrological risk maps. Additionally, the limits of the potentially floodable areas generated on digital elevation models with 30 points/m resolution (SRTM) do not correspond to the current topographic reality. Three tests (T1, T2, and T3) for modelling the floodplains and the comparative assessment of potential damages in the case of 30 localities in the study area (Başeu River basin) were carried out in this study. The results indicate that official data (T1) underestimate potential damage in the case of hydrological events with a recurrence interval probability of 1% (100‐year). The T2 [1%] (100‐year) results also highlight the role of hydro‐technical works in mitigating floods. In T3, the hydrological risk areas were generated with an accuracy of 0.5 m, evaluating the probable damage in cases of events with probabilities of 3% (33.3‐year), 1% (100‐year), and 0.1% (1,000‐year) recurrence intervals. The accuracy of the official hydrological hazard maps (T1) was improved using high‐density LiDAR data and HEC‐RAS software (T3).",

In this study, a well-established hydraulic model (HEC-RAS 5.0.7 (2D)) and Global Flood Monitoring System (GFMS) tools were utilized. The methodology solves two glitches related to flood studies, i.e., capability of HEC-RAS 2D flood model and GFMS discharge for 1D and 2D flood modeling and secondly using the output of the model, development of a methodology for the identification of various flood risk zones. The modeled and observed data were in close agreement indicating a successful application of HEC-RAS and GFSM data/tools. Using the methodology of this study, various flood modeling and delineation of risk zones can be made for various flood-affected areas in India and worldwide. These tools can also be used for making guidelines for emergency response in flood-affected areas.",

      "abstract": "Floods are the most frequent natural disaster and pose a very challenging threat to many cities worldwide. Understanding the flood dynamic is essential for developing strategies to reduce its risk and damages, thus ensuring the cities’ protection. This study evaluated the Capibaribe River basin's hydrological response to extreme events and its impact on the city of Recife, in the northeast of Brazil. The CAWM IV and HEC-HMS models were coupled with a high-resolution 2D HEC-RAS model to simulate the flood events of 1975 and 2011 in Recife. CAWM IV is a newly developed hydrological model that presented very promising results for the data-scarce watersheds of the Brazilian semiarid region. For the 2D hydrodynamic modeling, 1-m LiDAR DEM was used. A reservoir operation model was also applied to assess the effect of the basin's main reservoirs on the water system upstream from Recife. Lastly, the 2011 flood event was simulated under the scenario of an absence of this reservoir system. The strategy used to address flooding simulation in an urban area proved to be satisfactory. Of the events simulated with CAWM IV, 60% have at least a satisfactory adjustment with NSE sqrtQ coefficients greater than 0.36 in 95% of cases. With the reservoir operation model, it was possible to calculate the peak flow of the events of 1975 and 2011 as being 2574 and 731 m 3 /s, respectively. The 2D HEC-RAS model presented a measure of fit of approximately 0.7. The study showed that the reservoir system was responsible for reducing flood extent by 70.3% in the 2011 event, but even with this system, this event still caused a flood covering an area of 6.01 km 2 . The results indicate that although the reservoirs prevent severe flooding in the lower course of the Capibaribe River, Recife is still vulnerable to flooding.",

      "abstract": " Abstract. Assessing the risk of a historical-level flood at a large scale is essential for regional flood protection and resilience establishment. Due to limitations on the spatiotemporal coverage of observations, the risk assessment relies on model simulations thus is subject to uncertainties from various physical processes in the chain of the flood frequency analysis (FFA). This study assessed the FFA performance as well as the uncertainties with different combinations of FFA variables (river water depth and water storage), fitting distributions and runoff inputs based on the flood characteristics estimated by a global hydrodynamic model CaMa-Flood. Results show that fitting performance is better if FFA is conducted on river water depth and if Wakeby function is selected as the fitting distribution. Deviations in the runoff inputs are the main source of the uncertainties in the estimated flooded water depth based on point analysis. This deviation is relevant to the model ability to reproduce the mean state of annual maximum flood extent and it is almost homogeneous for different flood return period. The uncertainty resulted from fitting distributions increases from the regular period to the rarer floods. The regional investigation of high-resolution inundation area over the lower Mekong River basin shows similar statistics as the point analysis, implying a large uncertainty with 20% deviation in the total inundation area between different runoff inputs. Regional validation of the CaMa-Flood with two other flood hazard maps proves the reliability of the inundation in space and values. Global analysis on the floodplain water depth implies an increasing contribution of uncertainties in fitting distribution to the total uncertainties for rarer floods in almost all land grids. While the changes in contribution of uncertainties in runoff inputs differentiates in regions. The much higher contribution of runoff uncertainty for rarer floods in wet/flat regions necessitates special attention on rainfall-runoff model calibration (or runoff bias correction) if gauge discharge observations are available. Different adaptions to the large floods are needed for regions with different flood water depth and with different inundation agreements among simulations.",

      "abstract": "Floods are one of the deadliest natural hazards and are exacerbated by changes in land-use and climate. Urban development decreases infiltration by reducing pervious areas and increases the accumulation of pollutants during dry weather. It also decreases infiltration by reducing pervious areas and increases the accumulation of pollutants during dry periods. During rainy events, there is an increase in pollution concentrations and runoff that may be a source of water supply during drought periods. Modeling the quantity and quality dynamics of stormwater runoff requires a coupled hydrodynamic module capable of estimating the transport and fate of pollutants. In this paper, we evaluate the applicability of a distributed hydrodynamic model coupled with a water quality model (HydroPol2D). First, the model is compared to GSSHA and WCA2D in the V-Tilted catchment, and the limitation of the critical velocity of WCA2D is investigated. We also applied the model in a laboratory wooden board catchment, focusing on the validation of the numerical approach to simulate water quality dynamics. Then, we apply HydroPol2D in the Tijuco Preto catchment, in São Carlos-Brazil, and compare the modeled results with the full momentum solver of the HEC-RAS 2D. This catchment shares similar characteristics with many poorly-gauged and human-impacted catchments worldwide. The implementation of the model, the governing equations, and the estimation of input data are discussed, indicating the challenges and opportunities to scale HydroPol2D into the reality of data scarcity of larger poorly-gauged catchments. For a 1-yr return period of rainfall and antecedent dry days, and assuming an uncertainty of 40% in the water quality parameters, the results indicate that the maximum concentration of total suspended solids (TSS), the maximum load and the mass of the pollutant washed in 30% of the volume are, 456±260 mgL-1 km-2, 2. 56±0. 4 kgs-1 km-2, and 89%±10%, respectively.",

      "abstract": "A widely used land surface model, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, is coupled with a newly developed hierarchical dominant river tracing‐based runoff‐routing model to form the Dominant river tracing‐Routing Integrated with VIC Environment (DRIVE) model, which serves as the new core of the real‐time Global Flood Monitoring System (GFMS). The GFMS uses real‐time satellite‐based precipitation to derive flood monitoring parameters for the latitude band 50°N–50°S at relatively high spatial (∼12 km) and temporal (3 hourly) resolution. Examples of model results for recent flood events are computed using the real‐time GFMS (http://flood.umd.edu). To evaluate the accuracy of the new GFMS, the DRIVE model is run retrospectively for 15 years using both research‐quality and real‐time satellite precipitation products. Evaluation results are slightly better for the research‐quality input and significantly better for longer duration events (3 day events versus 1 day events). Basins with fewer dams tend to provide lower false alarm ratios. For events longer than three days in areas with few dams, the probability of detection is ∼0.9 and the false alarm ratio is ∼0.6. In general, these statistical results are better than those of the previous system. Streamflow was evaluated at 1121 river gauges across the quasi‐global domain. Validation using real‐time precipitation across the tropics (30°S–30°N) gives positive daily Nash‐Sutcliffe Coefficients for 107 out of 375 (28%) stations with a mean of 0.19 and 51% of the same gauges at monthly scale with a mean of 0.33. There were poorer results in higher latitudes, probably due to larger errors in the satellite precipitation input.",

These models included three lumped conceptual models (SAC-SMA: Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting, GR4J: modèle du Génie Rural à 4 paramètres Journalier, and MAC-HBV: McMaster University Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning), a semi-distributed model (HEC-HMS: Hydrologic Engineering Center’s Hydrologic Modeling System) and a fully distributed physically-based model (WATFLOOD: University of Waterloo Flood Forecasting System). The best model(s) were chosen by comparison of performance criteria. To verify the potential of the best performing hydrological models for operational use, deterministic hydrologic forecasts were performed. New hydrological insights for the region All five models are capable of simulating streamflow reasonably well in both calibration and validation periods. The SAC-SMA and GR4J models perform equally well and perform better than the other three models for all low, medium, and peak flows. The SAC-SMA and GR4J models generally perform better for peak flows, followed by HEC-HMS. Streamflow forecast experiment using deterministic weather prediction shows that SAC-SMA, GR4J, and HEC-HMS models perform well for up to 1–3 days ahead forecasts and are recommended for operational use. However, due to the good performance of all five models, an ensemble forecasting using continuous, multiple hydrological models is also recommended.",

      "abstract": "Study region The present study was conducted in the Machángara Alto and Chulco rivers, which belong to the Paute basin in the provinces of Azuay and Cañar in southern Ecuador. Study focus Andean watersheds are important providers of water supply for human consumption, food supply, energy generation, industrial water use, and ecosystem services and functions for many cities in Ecuador and in the rest of South America. In these regions, accurate quantification and prediction of water flow is challenging, mainly due to significant climatic variability and sparse monitoring networks. In the context of flow forecasting, this work evaluates the accuracy of two physical models (WEAP and GR2M) and two models based on artificial neural networks (ANN) that use meteorological data as input variables. Then, a hybrid technique is proposed, using the time series generated by the individual models as inputs of a new ANN. This approach aims to increase the accuracy of the simulated flow by combining and exploiting the information provided by physical and data-driven models. To assess the performance of the proposed methodology, statistical analyses are conducted for two case studies in the Andean region, where comparative analyses are performed for the individual models and the hybrid technique. New hydrological insights The results indicate that the proposed technique is able to improve the individual performance of physical and ANN-based models, yielding good results in the calibration and validation stages for the two case studies. Specifically, increases in NSE were observed from 0.64 to 0.99 in the MachÁngara Alto river, and from 0.88 to 0.99 in the Chulco river. Higher accuracy of the hybrid technique was observed for all evaluation criteria considered in the analyses. The performance of the hybrid technique was also reflected in terms of water supply and demand, suggesting possible applications for the regional management of water resources, where accurate flow predictions are of utmost importance.",

      "abstract": "Vegetation dynamics and hydrological processes are major components of terrestrial ecosystems, and they interact strongly with each other. Studies of hydrological responses to vegetation dynamics are usually conducted on a long‐term scale, whereas the hydrological responses within a single year have rarely been studied. In the present study, Poyang Lake runoff (PYL‐R) model, a new hydrological model coupled with leaf area index (LAI) remote sensing products, was established and applied to simulate the runoff process in the Poyang Lake Watershed. The simulation results obtained in three sub‐watersheds of the Poyang Lake Watershed (Ganjiang Watershed, Xinjiang Watershed, and Fuhe Watershed) agreed well with the observations (Nash efficiency coefficient values and R values exceeded 0.6 and 0.9, respectively). The PYL‐R experiment (PYL‐R‐E) model was designed as a contrast model without considering the impact of LAI. The simulated monthly runoff results obtained using the PYL‐R and PYL‐R‐E models were compared, and the within‐year changes in the differences between the two results were analysed to evaluate and quantify the impact of vegetation dynamic on runoff. From January to July, when LAI values increased by around 2.6 m 2 m −2 , monthly runoff depth differences between PYL‐R and PYL‐R‐E results increased by 35.25, 27.98, and 29.14 mm in the Ganjiang, Xinjiang, and Fuhe watersheds, respectively. Dense vegetation caused high interception and evapotranspiration during summer, which largely reduced runoff. By contrast, during winter, the effect of vegetation was weaker on runoff process whereas the impacts of other factors (e.g., precipitation) were higher. The sensitivity of monthly runoff to vegetation dynamics varied greatly throughout the whole year. In particular, during August and September, the LAI‐caused runoff changes were very high, accounting for 28–42% of monthly runoff in the sub‐watersheds. Our findings clarify the effects of changes in vegetation on hydrological processes over short time scales, thereby providing insights into the effects of scale on eco‐hydrological processes.",

However, VIC is computationally expensive in hydrologic prediction or forecast, which needs tens of thousands of runs of the model. To alleviate the burden of computation and reduce the losses of model fidelity, a new surrogate model (SM) coupling the self-organizing map and K-means clustering algorithm (SKC) with long short-term memory network (LSTM) is proposed. SKC is utilized to divide the subwatershed and select the representative cells in each subwatershed. LSTM is used to simulate the streamflow with the runoff of the representative cells. The new model is successfully applied in the Upper Brahmaputra River (UBR) basin, Southeast China. The results show that the SM-simulated streamflow has little difference from the VIC-simulated streamflow in terms of the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient efficiency, the main metric of SM performance, 0.9677 at Yangcun Station and 0.9696 at Nuxia Station. For the representative cells, SM retains partial spatial information of the runoff in the study area. The computational savings achieved through the use of SM are over 97% with only slight losses of accuracy in the application to the UBR basin.",

      "abstract": "Physically distributed hydrological models are effective in hydrological simulations of large river basins, but the complex characteristics of hydrological features limit their application. An easy-to-use and high-efficiency hydrological model is needed for efficient water resource management in practice. Machine learning (ML) based models have the potential to provide fast mapping pathways between meteorological predictors and hydrological responses without detailed descriptions of the corresponding physical processes. However, the extensive data requirements, ignoring of spatial variability and poor performance for extreme flows limit the application of ML models. This study attempts to develop an ML-based hydrological model by combining physically based distributed hydrological model with an artificial neural networks (ANN), computer vision (CV) and a categorization approach (CA). To solve the insufficient training problem, we use a physically distributed hydrological model (GBHM) together with a stochastic rainfall generator to generate a large amount of synthetic data (GBHM-ANN). To improve the extreme flow simulation, we add the categorization approach into GBHM-ANN (GBHM-ANN-CA). To capture the spatial variability of the predictors, we also use a local binary pattern-based computer vision method to form GBHM-ANN-CA-CV model. The effectiveness of the three modeling approaches are demonstrated by synthetic case studies. We finally evaluate GBHM-ANN-CA-CV using the real data from the upper Chao Phraya Basin in Thailand. The results show that the prediction accuracy of our new data-driven model is greatly improved in data-limited watersheds. Specifically, the CV extracted spatial information can improve the robustness of the data-driven hydrological model, and the CA can greatly improve high flow simulations. The combined model yields a satisfactory accuracy for long-term daily streamflow simulations. This study demonstrates the potential of ML-based hydrological models in water resource management, especially in changing environments.",

      "journal": "Hydrology and Earth System Sciences Discussions",
      "citations": 24,
      "abstract": "Land models are increasingly used in terrestrial hydrology due to their process-oriented representation of water and energy fluxes. Land models can be set up at a range of spatial configurations, often ranging from grid sizes of 0.02 to 2 degrees (approximately 2 to 200 km) and applied at sub-daily temporal resolutions for simulation of energy fluxes. A priori specification of the grid size of the land models typically is derived from forcing resolutions, modeling objectives, available geo-spatial data and computational resources. Typically, the choice of model configuration and grid size is based on modeling convenience and is rarely examined for adequate physical representation in the context of modeling. The variability of the inputs and parameters, forcings, soil types, and vegetation covers, are masked or aggregated based on the a priori chosen grid size. In this study, we propose an alternative to directly set up a land model based on the concept of Group Response Unit (GRU). Each GRU is a unique combination of land cover, soil type, and other desired geographical features that has hydrological significance, such as elevation zone, slope, and aspect. Computational units are defined as GRUs that are forced at a specific forcing resolution; therefore, each computational unit has a unique combination of specific geo-spatial data and forcings. We set up the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, based on the GRU concept (VIC-GRU). Utilizing this model setup and its advantages we try to answer the following questions: (1) how well a model configuration simulates an output variable, such as streamflow, for range of computational units, (2) how well a model configuration with fewer computational units, coarser forcing resolution and less geo-spatial information, reproduces a model set up with more computational units, finer forcing resolution and more geo-spatial information, and finally (3) how uncertain the model structure and parameters are for the land model. Our results, although case dependent, show that the models may similarly reproduce output with a lower number of computational units in the context of modeling (streamflow for example). Our results also show that a model configuration with a lower number of computational units may reproduce the simulations from a model configuration with more computational units. Similarly, this can assist faster parameter identification and model diagnostic suites, such as sensitivity and uncertainty, on a less computationally expensive model setup. Finally, we encourage the land model community to adopt flexible approaches that will provide a better understanding of accuracy-performance tradeoff in land models.",

      "abstract": "Expansion of a detailed hydrological modelling from catchment- to national- or continental-scale is of important theoretical and practical significance, yet faces many challenges. We developed a high-resolution, physically-based hydrological model named WEP-CN (Water and Energy transfer Processes in China) for China. Different climatic and hydrological conditions and geological structures as well as their impact on infiltration and runoff were examined and incorporated in WEP-CN. The study area (9.6 million km 2 ) was divided into 19,406 sub-watersheds and 81,687 contour belts. The computation units, model input, and model structure and parameters in WEP-CN were improved to obtain a well-defined simulation area, a more reliable input as well as a detailed description of soil moisture movement in several special vadose zones such as karst development, swelling and frozen soil. Continuous simulations of various natural hydrological processes were conducted for 62 years from 1956 to 2017. We demonstrated the efficacy of our model by comparing simulated and statistical monthly streamflow at 203 hydrological stations across the country. For the validation period of 1981–2000, the Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency ( NSE ) was found to be larger than 0.7 at 80% of the stations, and the absolute value of relative error ( RE ) was less than 10% at 95% of the stations. Our result highlights the benefit of incorporating new mechanisms on the special vadose zone water movement and accounts for the impact of elevation change on meteorological and vegetation variables. This paper can serve as a reference for large-scale hydrological simulation with diverse climate, topography and underlying surface conditions.",

      "abstract": "Exploring water fluxes between hydrological model (HM) components is essential to assess and improve model realism. Many classical metrics for HM diagnosis rely solely on streamflow and hence provide limited insights into model performance across processes. This study applies an information theory measure known as “transfer entropy” (TE) to systematically quantify the transfer of information among major HM components. To test and demonstrate the benefits of TE, we use the Framework for Understanding Structural Errors (FUSE) model to mimic and compare four commonly used HM structures, VIC, PRMS, SACRAMENTO, and TOPMODEL, across 671 catchments spanning a variety of hydrologic regimes in the conterminous United States. We explore connections between HM components and catchment landscape characteristics (e.g., climate, topography, soil, and vegetation) and characterize their nonlinear associations using distance correlation and Spearman correlation coefficients. Our results indicate that while the information transferred from precipitation to runoff is similar across model structures (likely as a result of calibration), the information transferred among other components can vary significantly from a FUSE structure to another. We find that aridity, precipitation duration and frequency, snow fraction, mean elevation, forest area, and leaf area index are often significantly associated with TE between the main HM components. We propose that the presence of meaningful nonlinear associations can be used to diagnose process representation in HMs. Our results highlight the necessity to enhance the conventional streamflow‐only calibration approach for a more realistic representation of water dynamics in the models.",

      "citations": 55,
      "abstract": "Precipitation is a key input variable in distributed surface water‐groundwater models, and its spatial variability is expected to impact watershed hydrologic response via changes in subsurface flow dynamics. Gridded precipitation data sets based on gauge observations, however, are plagued by uncertainty, especially in mountainous terrain where gauge networks are sparse. To examine the mechanisms via which uncertainty in precipitation data propagates through a watershed, we perform a series of numerical experiments using an integrated surface water‐groundwater hydrologic model, ParFlow.CLM. The Kaweah River watershed in California, USA, is used as our virtual catchment laboratory to characterize watershed response to variable precipitation forcing from headwaters to groundwaters. By applying the three‐cornered hat method, we quantify the spatially distributed uncertainty in four publically available precipitation forcing data sets and their simulated hydrology. Simulations demonstrate that uncertainty in the simulated groundwater storage is primarily a result of topographic redistribution of uncertainty in precipitation forcing. Soil water redistribution is the primary pathway that redistributes uncertainty downslope. We also find that topography exerts a larger impact than variable subsurface parameters on propagating uncertainty in simulated fluxes. Finally, we find that improvement in model performance metrics is higher for a single simulation forced with the mean precipitation from the available data sets than the averaged simulated results of separate simulations forced with each data set. Results from this study highlight the importance of topography‐moderated flow through the critical zone in shaping the groundwater response to climate variability.",

      "citations": 21,
      "abstract": "The years 2018 and 2019 were two of the hottest and driest in Mid‐Europe, highlighting the need for a comprehensive assessment of available water resources. In this study, we propose a probabilistic, terrestrial water assessment method, which utilizes a terrestrial forward model that closes the coupled water and energy cycles, from groundwater to the top of the atmosphere. In this methodology, the model is initialized with the current state of the water year and forced with a climatologic ensemble of atmospheric forcing to account for atmospheric uncertainty and natural variability. The simulations result in an ensemble of ensuing water years that are analyzed for subsurface water storage anomalies. The methodology was applied to the water years 2011/2012 and 2018/2019 and showed an increased probability of a significant water deficit in regions that had a water deficit in the previous year. This was also observed in an evaluation simulation. The results were compared to simulations with perfect forcing and uncertain initial conditions, and showed predictability at the interannual timescale and beyond, depending on the strength of the anomaly. The methodology was then applied to 2019/2020 to provide an outlook of the evolution of the current anomalies. The results emphasize the importance of accounting for groundwater dynamics in applied terrestrial models to account for long‐term memory effects in the terrestrial water cycle in forward simulations, over large spatial scales. This method of probabilistic subsurface water storage assessment may provide crucial information to public and industrial sectors for long‐term water resource planning.",

The AMHIRBSH was then applied to the Baiyangdian drainage basin, North China. After applying the Mann-Kendall test for trend and the Pettitt test for breakpoint, the runoff over the Baiyangdian drainage basin was shown to have had a breakpoint in approximately 1979, which split the time series into a baseline period (pre-1979) and an altered period (post-1979). The runoff was greatly reduced between these two periods. The runoff–runoff relationship of the Wangkuai and Xidayang sub-watersheds was evaluated using a copula function which showed it to have a non-stationarity degree of 35.64%, likely induced by massive afforestation programmes. This method provides an innovative perspective for attributing runoff variations to human activities.",

      "journal": "International Journal of Climatology",
      "citations": 18,
      "abstract": "As one of the most pressing issues in the world, climate change has already caused evident impacts on natural and human systems (e.g., hydrological cycle, eco‐environment and socio‐economy) in recent decades. In this study, an integrated multi‐GCMs Bayesian‐neural‐network hydrological analysis (MBHA) method is developed for quantifying climate change impacts on runoff. MBHA incorporates multiple global climate models (multi‐GCMs), hydrological model (HBV‐light), and Bayesian neural network (BNN) within a general framework. MBHA can provide the reliable prediction for runoff as well as reflect the impact of climate change on data scarcity catchments. MBHA is applied to the Amu Darya River basin in Central Asia. Climate data are derived from multiple GCMs (i.e., GFDL‐ESM2G, HadGEM2‐AO and NorESM1‐M) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Several findings can be summarized: (1) during 2021–2100, both precipitation and temperature would increase, with more precipitation falling as rain instead of snow; (2) by 2100, glacier areas are predicted to reduce by 62.3% (RCP4.5) and 71.9% (RCP8.5); (3) under RCP8.5, monthly runoff would increase by 11.2% in 2021–2060 and reduce by 5.0% in 2061–2100; this is because the glaciers would rapidly disappear with the rising temperature after 2060. The findings suggest that the shrinked glacier and the reduced runoff threaten the water availability especially in summer seasons as well as affect the agricultural irrigation in the downstream of the Amu Darya River.",

      "journal": "Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres",
      "citations": 35,
      "abstract": "The Community Land Model (CLM) is an effective tool to simulate the biophysical and biogeochemical processes and their interactions with the atmosphere. Although CLM version 5 (CLM5) constitutes various updates in these processes, its performance in simulating energy, water and carbon cycles over the contiguous United States (CONUS) at scales which land surface changes and hydrometeorological and hydroclimatological applications are more locally relevant is yet to be assessed. In this study, we conducted three simulations at 0.125° during 1979–2018 over the CONUS using different configurations of CLM, namely CLM5‐biogeochemistry (CLM5BGC), CLM4.5BGC, and CLM5‐satellite phenology (CLM5SP). We validated and compared their simulations against multiple remote‐sensed and in situ data sets. Overall, the parametric and structural updates (e.g., carbon cost for nitrogen uptake, variable soil thickness, dry surface layer) in CLM5 improve its ability in capturing terrestrial biogeochemical dynamics. The low evapotranspiration in CLM5BGC is associated with biases in simulating vegetation phenological characteristics rather than soil water limitations. The mismatch between CLM5BGC‐simulated peak leaf area index and reference data can be attributed to CLM5BGC's inability in simulating phenology of trees and grasses. The differences between CLM‐simulated irrigation and reference estimates can be attributed to differences between processes represented in models and in reality, and uncertainties in input and validation data sets. Evaluation against observations at small catchments suggest that hydrologic parameters needed to be calibrated to improve simulations of runoff, especially subsurface runoff. Additional efforts are needed to incorporate spatially distributed plant phenology and physiology parameters and regional‐specific agricultural management practices (e.g., planting and harvest).",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 29,
      "abstract": "Land surface models are important tools to represent and predict the spatiotemporal variability of evapotranspiration, which is a key variable in terrestrial water, energy and carbon cycles. However, evapotranspiration estimates from land surface models may suffer from various uncertainties in land surface modeling. Therefore, assessing the performance of evapotranspiration simulation plays a vital role in understanding the deficiencies of land surface modeling. Most of the evaluation studies of modeled evapotranspiration relied on comparisons with flux site observations (point scale) and water budget-derived evapotranspiration (basin scale), which have certain drawbacks and limitations. Thus, the evaluation results may be misleading for understanding the performance of land surface models on representing the spatial variability of evapotranspiration. In this study, a thorough spatial evaluation of the new and reprocessed Global Land Data Assimilation System evapotranspiration products is performed across China based on three bias-insensitive spatial evaluation methods, including the empirical orthogonal function analysis, the connectivity analysis and the fractions skill score. These evapotranspiration products were estimated from three land surface models, namely Noah, VIC and CLSM. The conventional evapotranspiration evaluation against eddy covariance measurements is also performed. The results show that all three products have consistent trends with the observed evapotranspiration series at both daily and monthly time scales. Noah and VIC have comparable performances in terms of different statistic metrics and outperform CLSM at both time scales. The spatial evaluation methods can provide additional valuable information to diagnose the model errors. VIC has the worst spatial performance during the warm months. Despite its inferior performance in late winter and early spring, Noah, overall, has the best spatial performance among the three. The gained insights of this study can help to improve the spatial performance of these models and further promote the system development.",

      "citations": 0,
      "abstract": "This study explores the use of satellite-based LULC (Land Use/Land Cover) data while simultaneously correcting potential evapotranspiration (PET) input with Leaf Area Index (LAI) to increase the performance of a physically distributed hydrologic model. The mesoscale hydrologic model (mHM) was selected for this purpose due to its unique features. Since LAI input informs the model about vegetation dynamics, we incorporated the LAI based PET correction option together with multi-year LULC data. The Globcover land cover data was selected for the single land cover cases, and hybrid of CORINE (coordination of information on the environment) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) land cover datasets were chosen for the cases with multiple land cover datasets. These two datasets complement each other since MODIS has no separate forest class but more frequent (yearly) observations than CORINE. Calibration period spans from 1990 to 2006 and corresponding NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency) values varies between 0.23 and 0.42, while the validation period spans from 2007 to 2010 and corresponding NSE values are between 0.13 and 0.39. The results revealed that the best performance is obtained when multiple land cover datasets are provided to the model and LAI data is used to correct PET, instead of default aspect-based PET correction in mHM. This study suggests that to minimize errors due to parameter uncertainties in physically distributed hydrologic models, adequate information can be supplied to the model with care taken to avoid over-parameterizing the model.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 36,
      "abstract": "The well-known conceptual Xin'anjiang model (XAJ) has limited capability for application in the basins with limited data due to two major runoff routing problems: relying on the observed flow data to estimate the parameters of the Muskingum method and lack of physics-based representation of spatial heterogeneity in key routing parameters such as the river network recession constant ( C s ). To tackle these issues, this study first developed a new hybrid rainfall-runoff model named the Xin’anjiang Digital CHannel (XAJ-DCH) model by coupling the XAJ model with the Muskingum-Cunge-Todini (MCT) and diffusion wave methods to improve the river network routing. Then a physics-based C s estimation method was developed to conquer the data limitation by deriving the quantitative relationships of the C s parameter with basin characteristics such as sub-catchment area, average river slope, average rainfall intensity, and average river width based on the mass conservation. The flood prediction capabilities of the XAJ and XAJ-DCH models were further tested and compared in the Tunxi Catchment with two nested sub-catchments. The results show that the XAJ-DCH model can predict stream flows well at both catchment outlet and internal channel grid cells without recalibration. Moreover, the derived C s values based on the proposed method enable both XAJ and XAJ-DCH models to gain good results with the averaged Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ranging between 0.91 and 0.95.",

      "abstract": "Despite the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model being used for decades in the hydrology community, there are still model parameters whose sensitivities remain unknown. Additionally, understanding the factors that control spatial variations in parameter sensitivities is crucial given the increasing interest in obtaining spatially coherent parameter fields over large domains. In this study, we investigate the sensitivities of 43 soil, vegetation and snow parameters in the VIC model for 101 catchments spanning the diverse hydroclimates of continental Chile. We implement a hybrid local-global sensitivity analysis approach, using eight model evaluation metrics to quantify sensitivities, with four of them formulated from runoff time series, two characterizing snow processes, and the remaining two based on evaporation processes. Our results confirm an overparameterization for the processes analyzed here, with only 12 (i.e., 28 %) parameters found to be sensitive, distributed among soil (7), vegetation (2) and snow (3) model components. Correlation analyses show that climate variables - in particular, mean annual precipitation and the aridity index - are the main controls on parameter sensitivities. Additionally, our results highlight the influence of the leaf area index on simulated hydrologic processes - regardless of the dominant climate types - and the relevance of hard-coded snow parameters. Based on correlation results and the interpretation of spatial sensitivity patterns, we provide guidance on the most relevant parameters for model calibration according to the target processes and the prevailing climate type. Overall, the results presented here contribute to an improved understanding of model behavior across watersheds with diverse physical characteristics that encompass a wide hydroclimatic gradient from hyperarid to humid systems.",

      "abstract": "This study performs a comparison of two model calibration/validation approaches and their influence on future hydrological projections under climate change by employing two climate scenarios (RCP2.6 and 8.5) projected by four global climate models. Two hydrological models (HMs), snowmelt runoff model + glaciers and variable infiltration capacity model coupled with a glacier model, were used to simulate streamflow in the highly snow and glacier melt–driven Upper Indus Basin. In the first (conventional) calibration approach, the models were calibrated only at the basin outlet, while in the second (enhanced) approach intermediate gauges, different climate conditions and glacier mass balance were considered. Using the conventional and enhanced calibration approaches, the monthly Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) for both HMs ranged from 0.71 to 0.93 and 0.79 to 0.90 in the calibration, while 0.57–0.92 and 0.54–0.83 in the validation periods, respectively. For the future impact assessment, comparison of differences based on the two calibration/validation methods at the annual scale (i.e. 2011–2099) shows small to moderate differences of up to 10%, whereas differences at the monthly scale reached up to 19% in the cold months (i.e. October–March) for the far future period. Comparison of sources of uncertainty using analysis of variance showed that the contribution of HM parameter uncertainty to the overall uncertainty is becoming very small by the end of the century using the enhanced approach. This indicates that enhanced approach could potentially help to reduce uncertainties in the hydrological projections when compared to the conventional calibration approach.",

      "citations": 31,
      "abstract": "Snowmelt and groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) dynamics are the most dominant controllers of hydrological processes and water availability in northern latitudes, particularly in warm seasons. The dynamics and changes of snowmelt and GW-SW interactions and their interrelationship at the regional scale are poorly understood in regional analyses. To fill this gap, this study implements a process-based hydrological model, using a coupled Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and MODFLOW model, to map snowmelt and GW-SW dynamics at regional scales. The primary research questions are “how are GW-SW interactions altered by snowmelt dynamics?” and “what is the effect of climate change on snowmelt and GW-SW dynamics?” We simulated snowmelt and groundwater dynamics across a large watershed encompassing different ecohydrological regions, including mountains, foothills, and plains, analyzing the spatio-temporal relationships between GW-SW interactions and snowmelts in historical (1983–2007) and future (2040–2064) periods. We used an ensemble of five global climate models (GCMs) for future projections based on two emission scenarios (ie, RCP2. 6 and RCP8. 5). We also used the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method to examine the effects of snowmelt, evapotranspiration (ET), and rainfall on GW-SW interactions. These analyses are implemented in mountains, foothills, and plains regions in a large snow-dominated watershed in western Canada. Results show that earlier snowmelt is predicted in mountains and foothills regions under climate change scenarios, while less snow accumulation and melt is anticipated in plains region. Future projections of GW-SW interactions show an increase in groundwater discharge to streams in the winter and spring seasons, mainly due to earlier snowmelt in winter and spring in mountains and foothills regions. On the other hand, more surface water loss to groundwater in summer and fall is predicted, which can be caused by the low level of groundwater under future conditions in foothills regions. Correlation analysis between regional snowmelt and GW-SW interactions for historical simulations show a higher correlation (R 2= 0.494) in mountains region, compared to very low correlations (R 2< 0.01) in foothills and plains regions. LASSO results showed that ET was the main control of dynamics of GW-SW interactions in all regions of the study. Snowmelt was the next most important predictor of GW-SW dynamics in the mountains region, while rainfall was more important in the foothills region. Nevertheless, none of the three predictors strongly influenced GW-SW dynamics in the plains region, mainly due to low groundwater levels and a lack of connectivity with the surface water. Overall, it is shown that the eco-hydrogeological and climatic variability of different regions plays an important part in governing GW-SW dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Although global- and catchment-scale hydrological models are often shown to accurately simulate long-term runoff time-series, far less is known about their suitability for capturing hydrological extremes, such as droughts. Here we evaluated simulations of hydrological droughts from nine catchment scale hydrological models (CHMs) and eight global scale hydrological models (GHMs) for eight large catchments: Upper Amazon, Lena, Upper Mississippi, Upper Niger, Rhine, Tagus, Upper Yangtze and Upper Yellow. The simulations were conducted within the framework of phase 2a of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP2a). We evaluated the ability of the CHMs, GHMs and their respective ensemble means (Ens-CHM and Ens-GHM) to simulate observed hydrological droughts of at least one month duration, over 31 years (1971–2001). Hydrological drought events were identified from runoff-deficits and the Standardised Runoff Index (SRI). In all catchments, the CHMs performed relatively better than the GHMs, for simulating monthly runoff-deficits. The number of drought events identified under different drought categories (i.e. SRI values of -1 to -1.49, -1.5 to -1.99, and ≤-2) varied significantly between models. All the models, as well as the two ensemble means, have limited abilities to accurately simulate drought events in all eight catchments, in terms of their occurrence and magnitude. Overall, there are opportunities to improve both CHMs and GHMs for better characterisation of hydrological droughts.",

      "abstract": "Vegetation dynamics have different effects on the terrestrial water cycle and therefore play an important role in catchment-scale biophysical and hydrological modeling. Meanwhile, validation of hydrological models of irrigated watersheds concerning vegetation dynamics has rarely been studied. In this study, we propose a combinatorial approach for modelling irrigated watersheds; at first, based on Sentinel-2 (S2), we provide crop/land-use mapping; then we retrieve S2-based leaf area index (LAI) through the neural network algorithm and the PROSAIL model; finally, we employ sequential particle filter (PF) technique to explore the benefits of jointly assimilating high-resolution S2-LAI as well as in-situ river discharge observations for improving the predictive accuracy of SWAT + model. Moreover, we explain how SWAT + source code must be modified to implement the assimilation procedure. The developed methodology is applied to an irrigated watershed in Iran; we provide 66 raster LAI maps with a spatial resolution of 20 m for the study area related to January to December of 2019 as well as crop/land-use mapping of 2019 with a spatial resolution of 10 m. Results show that improvements in the hydrological simulation of LAI, evapotranspiration, and river discharge are achieved when we apply multivariate assimilation of S2-LAI and streamflow observations, compared to univariate assimilation scenarios. Results also reveal that LAI assimilation has a significant influence on the estimation of irrigation volume and timing.",

      "abstract": "Study region Nile basin. Study focus Several studies have shown a relationship between climate change and changes in sediment yield. However, there are limited modeling applications that study this relationship at regional scales mainly due to data availability and computational cost. This study proposes a methodological framework using the SWAT+ model to predict and project sediment yield at a regional scale in data-scarce regions using global datasets. We implement a framework that (a) incorporates topographic factors from high/medium resolution DEMs (b) incorporates crop phenology data (c) introduces an areal threshold to linearize sediment yield in large model units and (d) apply a hydrological mass balance calibration. We test this methodology in the Nile Basin using a model application with (revised) and without (default) the framework under historical and future climate projections. New hydrological insights for the region Results show improved sediment yield estimates in the revised model, both in absolute values and spatial distribution when compared to measured and reported estimates. The contemporary long term (1989 – 2019) annual mean sediment yield in the revised model was 1.79 t ha −1 yr −1 and projected to increase by 61 % (44 % more than the default estimates) in the future period (2071 – 2100), with the greatest sediment yield increase in the eastern part of the basin. Thus, the proposed framework improves and influences modeled and predicted sediment yield respectively.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 10,
      "abstract": "Leaf area index (LAI) is essential for modelling the land surface temperature (LST) and related energy budget in the land surface models (LSMs). Due to the lack of a parameterization scheme based on satellite LAI data, it is unclear whether satellite LAI data can improve the performance of Noah with multi-parameterization (Noah-MP) LSM to model LST in China land data assimilation system (CLDAS). Here, by using satellite LAI data reconstructed by the advanced deep learning method, we established a new vegetation scheme based on satellite data for the Noah-MP LSM in the CLDAS. We quantitatively evaluated simulation effects of different vegetation schemes including the parameter table scheme (TAB), the dynamic vegetation scheme (DVEG), and the satellite LAI data scheme (OBS), on modelling LAI, LST and their related energy budget in China from 2016 to 2018. We found that except for the cropland, the LAI of the vegetation in growing season observed by satellite was lower than that simulated by the Noah-MP LSM. Validations based on the automatic weather stations in the vegetation-covered area showed that compared with the TAB and DVEG scheme, the OBS scheme improved the negative bias and high unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) of simulated LST. Compared with the TAB and DVEG scheme, the optimal improvements of the OBS scheme for annual mean bias and annual mean ubRMSE were 0.32 °C and 0.17 °C, respectively. We further revealed the mechanism of LAI on LST simulation in the Noah-MP LSM by decomposed temperature metric method. With the adoption of the new satellite LAI-based scheme, the absorbed radiation (SW), sensible heat flux (H), latent heat flux (LE), and ground heat flux (G) simulated by the Noah-MP LSM tend to change in different directions, leading to an overall increase in the net energy absorbed by the surface, which is consistent with the LST changes. The LAI changes of dense vegetation affect the LST simulation mainly through the competition of the absorbed shortwave radiation and turbulent heat fluxes. Due to the influence of exposed soil, the LAI changes of sparse vegetation mainly affect the LST simulation mainly through the interaction of the absorbed shortwave radiation and ground heat flux. Our study highlighted that the application of satellite LAI data has the potential to improve simulations of multiple land surface processes in the Noah-MP LSM.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Research",
      "citations": 6,
      "abstract": "The fragile balance of endorheic lakes in highly managed semiarid basins with transboundary water issues has been altered by the intertwined effects of global warming and long‐term water mismanagement to support agricultural and industrial demand. The alarming rate of global endorheic lakes' depletion in recent decades necessitates formulating mitigation strategies for ecosystem restoration. However, detecting and quantifying the relative contribution of causal factors (climate variability and anthropogenic stressors) is challenging. This study developed a diagnostic multivariate framework to identify major hydrologic drivers of lake depletion in a highly managed endorheic basin with a complex water distribution system. The framework integrates the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) simulations with time series decomposition and clustering methods to identify the major drivers of change. This diagnostic framework was applied to the Salton Sea Transboundary Basin (SSTB), the host of the world's most impaired inland lake. The results showed signs of depletion across the SSTB since late 1998 with no significant changes in climate conditions. The time series data mining of the SSTB water balance components indicated that decreases in lake tributary inflows (−16.4 Mm 3 yr −2 ) in response to decline in Colorado River inflows, associated with state water transfer agreements, are causing the Salton Sea to shrink, not changes in the irrigation operation as commonly believed. The developed multivariate detection and attribution framework is useful for identifying major drivers of change in coupled natural human systems.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the changes in hydrological process is a key subject for water resource management of a high-diversity watershed. In this paper, through an establishment of a SWAT-based model, the effects of climate change and its induced vegetation change on hydrological process were analyzed in the East River Basin. The model could well simulate the hydrological processes of the basin including surface runoff (SURQ), groundwater (GWQ), lateral flow (LATQ), total water yield (WYLD), actual evapotranspiration (ET), and groundwater recharge (PERC). Under the vegetation change induced by temperature increase, the effects of the vegetation change on hydrological process were larger than that of the temperature change. Under the vegetation change caused by the increase of temperature and precipitation, the vegetation change enhanced the effects of climate change on annual SURQ, LATQ, GWQ, WYLD, and PERC of the basin. Under spatial scale, when the temperature and precipitation changed simultaneously, the increase of precipitation could promote the increase of annual ET in sub-watersheds. Also, the annual SURQ, WYLD, GWQ and ET in western sub-watersheds were more sensitive to the cumulative changes of vegetation and climate. This work can provide useful information to decision makers in water resource management of watersheds.",

      "abstract": "Climate change and population growth are increasing demand for water, causing water shortages across the United States. Decision makers need to understand the impact of climate on water allocation, particularly for watersheds with agricultural activity. The Missouri Salt River Basin (SRB) was selected for this study due to its soil characteristics, agriculturally dominated land use, and because it contains a major reservoir, Mark Twain Lake (MTL), which is the regional source of drinking water. The goal was to evaluate future water allocation in the SRB given projections of future climate and changing land management practices. Future climate data were input to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool, from which discharge outputs to MTL were entered in the Water Evaluation and Planning model to evaluate 2020–2059 crop and drinking water shortages. Water allocation strategies identified potential conflicts among users through scenario‐based approaches. The difference between water demand and supply was projected to increase by 100% because of climate change, from 3 to 6 million m 3 . Under a dramatic scenario, where irrigated land quadrupled, water shortage could be up to 38.5 million m 3 (1,200% increase). Water withdrawals from the MTL may help alleviate part of the projected shortage; however, on‐farm pond storage would likely be more practical and cost‐effective. Overall, the paper provides a methodology for water allocation strategy.",

The study considered various plausible scenarios of inflows (10 to 20% reduction), pollution scenarios of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) (0 to 100% treatment) for arriving drains by altering headwaters DO (4 to 8 mg/l). Eflow water quality charts were developed for the regulation of reservoir downstream river water quality for Bhadra river in India as case study. The study revealed that by maintaining the headwater DO in conjunction with BOD treatment of drains and with sufficient Eflow allocation, downstream river water quality can be improved. By maintaining a headwater DO of 7 mg/l with BOD treatment of drains of 25% and by providing Eflow allocation of 40.12 m 3 /s with class D, the Bhadravathi river stretch has shown an improved river water quality with about 6.65 mg/l of average DO.",

We calibrated the model using a multi-objective optimization algorithm and using data from two gauging stations in the mainstream for the period 2000–2020. Furthermore, we validated the flow intermittency simulations against stage data series at 14 stations. The results indicated that the model accurately simulates flow intermittency and low flows in the study period. We observed a significant variation in flow intermittency in both space and time with a remarkable inter-annual variability. We also observed an increase in flow intermittency over the study period.",

Numerous studies tried to overcome this problem utilizing different remote sensing products, which provided a great solution to solve these issues with a high level of certainty. NASA developed a Land Information System which integrates satellite and ground-based observational data products through terrestrial hydrology modeling and data assimilation techniques. This research aims to overcome the data sacristy using NASA LIS model. The targeted study areas are Blue Nile Basin and Atbara Basin due to their importance for the Nile Basin flow. The model validation was conducted using three observed stations and two comparison models; WEAP model is used to simulate Atbara Basin while MIKE-BASIN model is used for Blue Nile Basin. Four performance indicators used to assess LIS model performance (i.e., Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Percent-BIAS (PBAIS), Coefficient of Determination ( R 2 ) and Root mean square error to observations standard deviation ratio (RSR)). The indicator results showed very good performance for the LIS model at Atbara Basin, while it showed unsatisfactory performance for Blue Nile Basin. This demonstrates that LIS model is suitable for natural flow basins where no water infrastructures exist, and that it could simulate sufficiently in basins facing data leakage and have no observation systems like the Nile Basin.",

      "abstract": "There is a lack of Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulations in numerical hydrology, contributing to the lack of application of canned adaptive timestep solvers; hence the continued dominance of fixed (e.g., Euler) timestep techniques despite their fundamental problems. In this paper, we reformulate Dynamic-TOPMODEL into a constraint-handling ODE form and use MATLAB's advanced adaptive ODE-solvers to solve the resulting system of equations. For wider applicability, but based on existing research and/or first principles, we developed Generalized Multistep Dynamic TOPMODEL which includes: iso-basin spatial discretization, diffusion wave routing, depth-dependent overland flow velocity, relaxing the assumption of water-table parallelism to the ground surface, a power-law hydraulic conductivity profile, new unsaturated zone flux, and a reference frame adjustment. To demonstrate the model we calibrate it to a peat catchment case study, for which we also test sensitivity to spatial discretization. Our results suggest that (a) a five-fold improvement in model runtime can result from adaptive timestepping; (b) the additional iso-basin discretization layer, as a way to further constrain spatial information where needed, also improves performance; and (c) the common-practice arbitrary Topographic Index (TI) discretization substantially alters calibrated parameters. More objective and physically constrained (e.g., top-down) approaches to TI classification may be needed.",

      "abstract": "The river basin sustainability depends on both the coordinated development of socio-ecological systems and resilience to water resources. However, the lack of integrating them on spatial and temporal scales compromises our capacity to develop precise interventions towards sustainable river basins. We developed an approach by integrating water security and social-ecological coupling to assess the river basin sustainability. We divided it into four categories including highly sustainable (secure and coordinated), insecure, uncoordinated, and low sustainable (insecure and uncoordinated). The middle reach of Heihe River (MHR) was taken as the study area with the sub-basin as the spatial analysis unit from 2000 to 2020. The results showed that there was heterogeneity and agglomeration in spatial distribution. 23.8 %, 38.8 %, and 11% of the sub-basins mainly clustered in the north and central areas were found in the state of water insecure and SES uncoordinated, or both respectively. The unsustainable areas (five sub-basins) and lose-lose areas (two sub-basins) should be the priority areas for management interventions. Our approach can provide an important reference for assessing and improving the river basin sustainability.",

      "abstract": "Global freshwater resources are vital to humanity and Earth's ecosystems, yet about one third of the global population is affected by water scarcity for at least one month per year. In these areas, the overuse of freshwater resources can lead to the threat of depletion, marking them as the global'water scarcity hotspots'. This study combines outputs from a global hydrological model (PCR-GLOBWB 2) with an extensive literature search to provide a comprehensive intercomparison of the key drivers, pressures, states, impacts and responses (DPSIR) that shape the water gap between water demand and availability at the most important water scarcity hotspots worldwide. Hydroclimatic change, population growth, and water use for the industrial, municipal and agricultural sectors are the most important driving and pressuring forces on the water gap, affecting both water quality and quantity. These drivers and pressures have been showing increasing trends at all hotspots, which is concerning for the future development of the water gap. Additionally, we identify and characterize seven clusters of hotspots based on shared DPSIR patterns, revealing their common mechanisms. Our work highlights the diversity of water scarcity related issues at hotspots, especially the variety of impacts involved and governmental responses in place. The results of our DPSIR analysis provide valuable insights for building causal networks representing water gap dynamics at the hotspots. They form a foundation for conceptual models that illuminate human-water interactions, trade-offs, and synergies at the hotspots, while guiding policymakers in addressing the multifaceted challenge of closing the water gap.",

      "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) is the dominant water loss flux in mesic tallgrass prairie. Partitioning of ET into its two components-soil evaporation (E) and plant transpiration (T)-is challenging but critical for unraveling biophysical processes underlying ecosystem functioning and sustainability in a changing environment. Because of the pulsed nature of ecophysiological processes in this water-limited ecosystem, we carried out two field campaigns during wetting-drying episodes following precipitation pulses. We applied a two-source isotopic mixing model for ET partitioning. The isotopic compositions of ET, E, and T (, , and ) were determined by the Keeling-plot method, the Craig-Gordon model, and midday plant xylem water, respectively. We found that the ET partitioning results () could be more accurately quantified with 2H than with 18O, because of (1) the better performance of 2H in Keeling-plot regressions of high-temporal-frequency isotopic measurements of water vapor, and (2) the stronger sensitivity of 2H to the equilibrium fractionation. Using 2H values, we found that the mean ± standard deviation of was 0.84 ± 0.05 and 0.92 ± 0.06 during two field campaigns. Soil water near the surface (especially the top 10 cm) responded actively during these two wetting-drying episodes and was the major source for the total ET flux during the initial drying periods. Only after shallow soil moisture had become substantially exhausted did deeper soil layers (up to 1 m) increasingly become the major source for the T flux, while the E flux declined progressively to a negligible level.",

Study focus Precipitation, snowmelt, streamflow, and groundwater samples were collected in the NRW and used to analyze the contribution of different water sources to streamflow during different freeze–thaw periods. Stable isotopes of hydrogen (D) and oxygen ( 18 O) and water chemistry were analyzed for the period ranging from 2016 to 2019, and tritium (T) and carbon-14 ( 14 C) isotopes were analyzed for 2019. New hydrological insights for the region Rain and snowmelt were found to reflect the chemical characteristics of precipitation, and the primary ions in both water types were Ca 2+ and SO 4 2− . The δD and δ 18 O isotope values of rain and snowmelt were relatively low during the entire thaw period (from June to October) and relatively high in the entire frozen period (from November to May). The results of the optimum multiparameter and mass balance analyses showed that groundwater and snowmelt accounted for approximately 39.8 % and 32.2 % to the Nagqu River water flow, respectively, whereas precipitation accounted for approximately 28.0 %. The groundwater in clastic rock fissures around the northern Cuona Lake, and permafrost and ground ice in the bedrock layer were identified as older water types with relatively low infiltration rates, and bedrock fissures in the southeastern and southwestern areas contained younger water with better recoverability.",

      "abstract": "Seasonal stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen (δ13C and δ15N) in the particulate organic matter (POM) of the euphotic layer were investigated around the Kuroshio from 2008 to 2019 (n = 474). Significant seasonality in POM δ13C and δ15N were observed in the coastal and offshore areas divided by the northern edge of the Kuroshio. Seasonal mean δ13C was highest during the summer (−23.2 ± 1.1‰ and −23.7 ± 1.1‰ in coastal and offshore areas, respectively) and lowest during the winter (−24.6 ± 0.8‰ and −25.0 ± 0.9‰ in coastal and offshore areas, respectively) in both areas. Seasonal mean δ15N exhibited different spatial variations. The mean δ15N value in the coastal area was the lowest during the winter (1.0 ± 1.9‰) and increased to a similar level (∼3‰) during the other three seasons. In contrast, δ15N in the offshore area near the surface decreased from the spring (2.5 ± 1.5‰) to the summer (1.2 ± 1.7‰). These spatial and seasonal differences in δ15N are significant in generalized linear models and the generalized additive models, and suggest that the nitrogen sources used in biological production differ between coastal and offshore areas and between seasons. Nitrate originating in deeper water and rivers is the main sources used for new production throughout the year in the coastal area. Contributions from atmospheric deposition and nitrogen fixation are significant in the offshore area during the summer, while nitrate originating in deeper water is main during winter, spring, and fall in the offshore area.",

      "abstract": "Stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in precipitation, which are sensitive to climate change and the water cycle, are widely used as natural tracers to investigate hydrological processes and paleoclimate reconstruction. High resolution event-based precipitation sampling was conducted in Guilin, a subtropical monsoon climate region in Southwest China, from 2010 to 2016 to identify the temporal variability of stable isotopes of precipitation and its dominant meteorological factors. The results showed that the stable isotopes of precipitation exhibited significant seasonal variability, with lower values in the wet season and higher values in the dry season, reflecting the changes in the character of precipitation in response to seasonal variability of the moisture sources and atmospheric dynamics. δ 18 O values were significantly negatively correlated with temperature and potential evapotranspiration (ET 0 ) on the daily and monthly timescales; however, there was no significant correlation between monthly δ 18 O and the amount of rainfall. Multivariate regression analysis showed that when temperature, precipitation amount and ET 0 were considered, 39% of the variability of the monthly oxygen isotope composition of precipitation was explained. Monthly mean temperature had a higher covariation with precipitation δ 18 O, indicating that the variations of precipitation isotope were more dependent on temperature, but not substantially dependent on the amount effect of rainfall. Howerver, the main influence of meteorological factors on the isotopic variations of precipitation varied seasonally. Temperature strongly influenced the isotopic composition of precipitation in summer, while the amount effect was prominent due to the enhanced convective activity characterized by more depleted δ 18 O values. Although evapotranspiration is a minor contributor of precipitation isotope variability, the impact of evapotranspiration on the enrichment of precipitation isotopes in autumn is a substantial control and should be considered, which makes a major contribution to compensate for the depletion in heavy isotopes of rainfall. The non-linear relationship between d-excess and ET 0 was attributed to the variable contribution of large-scale convective moisture and local evaporation, as well as water vapor transfer processes. The response of precipitation stable isotopes to convective events was characterized by distinct stage patterns, associated with the water vapor sources and physical processes during rainout. The significant depletion of precipitation δ 18 O values during convective events was not due to the ‘amount effect’, but due to large-scale convection activity. These findings provide further insight into intraevent-scale isotopic variations associated with organized convection and their key influencing factors, which ultimately improves our interpretation of the paleoclimate records in subtropical monsoon regions.",

      "abstract": "Spatially and seasonally distributed information on transpiration (T) fluxes is limited in the tropics. Here, we applied a coupled isotope mass balance model to separate water fluxes of T and evapotranspiration (ET) from precipitation (P). The mean annual T was estimated at a resolution of 100 m for Costa Rica (51,100 km 2 ) and a partitioning of monthly T and evaporation (E) for the 2370‐km 2 San Carlos catchment. The dominant flux in the forest ecosystems was T with a mean annual T of 1086 mm that ranged from 700 mm in Tropical Montane Very Humid Forest to 1400 mm in Subtropical and Tropical Low Montane Rainforests. We estimated an average 85% of ET was T, which is concurrent with expectations for forested tropical regions, but varied according to model parameterization and data sources. A model comparison exercise showed a range of mean annual T estimates from 988 to 1465 mm and a range of T/P from 0.35 to 0.5 with temperature and relative humidity exhibiting the highest impact on the model results. Across Costa Rica, we estimated an average loss of precipitation by T of 38% (1085 mm), whereas interception (I) constitutes 10% (230 mm) and direct evaporation (E) only 7% (192 mm). Similarly, the results at the catchment scale indicated that monthly T contributes 76% (85‐mm monthly average) to total ET and E corresponds to 24% (24‐mm monthly average). The T rates exhibited an opposite seasonality to rainfall with highest T over the drier months from December to April with a peak in March (101–144 mm) and the minimum T in September (53–71 mm). Around 17% (79–130 mm) of precipitation over the catchment area is lost to T, both E (10–35 mm) and I (15–38 mm) correspond to 5%. Despite the inherent uncertainties of the data assumptions and simplifications, including data interpolation errors, the coupled isotope mass balance model showed in comparison to other global products reasonable water partitioning for different ecosystems in Costa Rica and the San Carlos catchment area. These results can help to evaluate the impact of land cover conversion on the hydrological cycle in Costa Rica, and the simple isotope‐based model could be transferred to different biomes of the tropics.",

      "journal": "Catena",
      "citations": 16,
      "abstract": "Although the Ganga is an important fluvial system of India, the isotopic investigations of its water are limited and not reported for the whole length of the river. This limits the understanding of the hydrological processes of the river whose flow characteristics have been changed considerably over the years due to changes in the climate and land use/land cover patterns of the region. This study intends to fill this gap of data and knowledge. Hence, a robust isotope datasets were generated for a period of 2–3 years from 11 locations covering the entire length of the river (2250 km). These data were further analysed to study the controls on spatiotemporal patterns of river water isotopes and understand dominance of different hydrological processes affecting flow characteristics of the river in different reaches. The stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in river water exhibited large spatial and temporal variation throughout the study periods. The most negative isotopic values (mean δ 18 O: −15‰ to −9.7‰) between 0 and 318 km in the mountainous region during pre-monsoon period attributes to the dominant glaciers melt contribution while the altitude effect in rainfall is mainly responsible during monsoon season. However, less negative isotopic values (mean δ 18 O: −9.7‰ to −4.3‰) between 318 and 1000 km correspond to the mixing of water from major tributaries. Other hydrological factors responsible for the increased isotopic values include evaporative enrichment and contribution of isotopically less negative groundwater. The observed relatively low isotopic values (δ 18 O: −4.3‰ to −6.9‰) in the downstream of 1000 km of the river are due to joining of tributaries originating from the Nepal Himalayas. Results substantiate that distinct isotopic values found in different reaches of the river are because of the variations in basin characteristics, hydro-meteorological processes, and water mixing. These findings would contribute in developing a better knowledge on hydrological behaviour of the Ganga River and help in taking appropriate measures for maintaining its sustainable flows.",

      "abstract": "We examine groundwater recharge processes and their relationship to rainfall intensity in the semi-arid, southwestern Lake Chad Basin of Nigeria using a newly compiled database of stable isotope data (δ 2 H, δ 18 O) from groundwater and rainfall. δ 18 O signatures in groundwater proximate to surface waters are enriched in 18 O relative to regional rainfall and trace focused groundwater recharge from evaporated waters via ephemeral river discharge and Lake Chad; groundwater remote from river channels is comparatively depleted and associated with diffuse recharge, often via sand dunes. Stable isotope ratios of O and H (δ 2 H, δ 18 O) in groundwater samples regress to a value along the local meteoric waterline that is depleted relative to weighted mean composition of rainfall, consistent with rainfall exceeding the 60 th percentile of monthly precipitation intensity. The observed bias in groundwater recharge to heavy monthly rainfall suggests that the intensification of tropical rainfall under global warming favours groundwater recharge in this basin.",

      "citations": 15,
      "abstract": "In peri-urban catchments where treated wastewater effluents are released into surface waters, knowledge of water sources and partitioning is important for mitigating water quality impacts, particularly during warm and dry periods with low discharge rates. Useful tools for the identification of water sources and flow paths under different wetness conditions are isotope tracers. However, very few studies have been carried out so far in urbanized catchments with complex land use distributions where natural headwaters interact with engineered components, e.g. effluent discharge. We undertook spatio-temporal sampling of isotopes, combined with water quality measurements, to complement climatic and hydrometric data across the 220 km 2 peri-urban Erpe catchment near Berlin and assess seasonal changes in water sources during two exceptionally warm and dry years (2018 and 2019). The study showed a deterioration of water quality downstream of two municipal wastewater treatment plants; and the depletion of groundwater storage, along with isotopic enrichment of the stream, in summer 2019 (the second consecutive year with above-average temperatures and marked precipitation deficits). Streamflow in the upper reaches of the catchment was dominated by groundwater-fed tributaries in winter, but became increasingly dominated by wastewater in summer. In the lower catchment, flows were dominated by effluent from a large wastewater treatment plant, especially in summer. Young water from precipitation and urban storm runoff accounted for < 10 % of streamflow, despite the catchment being ~ 20 % urban. Similarities in the composition of wastewater and other runoff sources resulted in high uncertainties in end member separation and highlight the need for monitoring of other tracers to better characterize water impacts. Given climate change projections for the region are for drier, warmer summers, wastewater is likely to become a more dominant component of streams, which may have implications for environmental quality and ecosystem services.",

The results, for the Shiraz catchment in Iran, show that (i) SWAT-MODFLOW has better performance than stand-alone SWAT (R 2 improvement from 0.50 to 0.54) and (ii) SWAT-MODFLOW calibrated with insights from isotope data (SWAT-MODFLOW-ISO) has significantly better performance than SWAT-MODFLOW (R 2 improvement from 0.54 to 0.68 and RMSE reduction from 1.67 to 1.33). This demonstrates that insights into SW-GW interactions that are revealed by isotopes can be used to improve hydrological modelling performance.",

      "journal": "Hydrological Processes",
      "citations": 24,
      "abstract": "Isotopic information from 81 snowpits was collected over a 5‐year period in a large, Colorado watershed. Data spans gradients in elevation, aspect, vegetation, and seasonal climate. They are combined with overlapping campaigns for water isotopes in precipitation and snowmelt, and a land‐surface model for detailed estimates of snowfall and climate at sample locations. Snowfall isotopic inputs, describe the majority of δ 18 O snowpack variability. Aspect is a secondary control, with slightly more enriched conditions on east and north facing slopes. This is attributed to preservation of seasonally enriched snowfall and vapour loss in the early winter. Sublimation, expressed by decreases in snowpack d‐excess in comparison to snowfall contributions, increases at low elevation and when seasonal temperature and solar radiation are high. At peak snow accumulation, post‐depositional fractionation appears to occur in the top 25 ± 14% of the snowpack due to melt‐freeze redistribution of lighter isotopes deeper into the snowpack and vapour loss to the atmosphere during intermittent periods of low relative humidity and high windspeed. Relative depth of fractionation increases when winter daytime temperatures are high and winter precipitation is low. Once isothermal, snowpack isotopic homogenization and enrichment was observed with initial snowmelt isotopically depleted in comparison to snowpack and enriching over time. The rate of δ 18 O increase (d‐excess decrease) in snowmelt was 0.02‰ per day per 100‐m elevation loss. Isotopic data suggests elevation dictates snowpack and snowmelt evolution by controlling early snow persistence (or absence), isotopic lapse rates in precipitation and the ratio of energy to snow availability. Hydrologic tracer studies using stable water isotopes in basins of large topographic relief will require adjustment for these elevational controls to properly constrain stream water sourcing from snowmelt.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 20,
      "abstract": "Sustainably meeting the growing water demand of cities during a changing climate will be a major challenge in the near future. Adjusting water management strategies towards preserving urban water resources while best utilizing urban “blue” and “green” infrastructure will require precise knowledge of urban water cycling, storage and losses across large built-up areas. To gain this understanding, using stable isotopes of water as tracers in the hydrological cycle can provide valuable insights, but their application remains challenging in complex and heterogeneous metropolitan areas. This study used stable isotopes, combined with hydrometric and climatic data, to assess the imprint of the urban area and climate warming on a large urbanised river system, the River Spree in Berlin, Germany, during the exceptionally warm and dry 2018 – 2020 period. Isotope dynamics in the Spree reflected gradually varying seasonal patterns with more enriched values in summer and more depleted values in winter. Large-scale climate variability and evaporative losses in the upstream catchment, along with anthropogenic activities, impacted isotope and discharge dynamics in the Spree, especially during warm and dry summer and autumn periods. In local urban sub-catchments, variability of isotope dynamics and subsequent water ages and transit times were largely affected by engineered system components, i.e. catchment imperviousness, connectivity to storm drains and effluent discharge. Berlin’s green spaces were largely disconnected from surface waters. Urban trees in particular had high water demands during dry periods that may be hard to sustain, as trees showed slower replenishment of soil moisture during winter, resulting in shorter recharge periods under trees. More research will be needed on: (a) how planting design with alternations of urban grassland, shrub and trees can enhance infiltration and maintain water demands for trees during drought; and (b) on better quantifying open-water evaporation in the upstream catchment to fully account for catchment water losses. To sustainably manage and preserve not just Berlin’s but also similar cities’ water resources in the future, our results indicate that both integrated city- and catchment-scale measures will be necessary.",

      "abstract": "Effective management of water resources requires an understanding of local hydrology and its links to precipitation. This study provides insights into geometeorological controls on precipitation and the hydraulic relationship between the water sources in the Doon Valley of the Indian Himalaya. Results suggest that inherent variance in isotopic characteristics of precipitation is closely associated with the evolution of different sources of moisture and topographic features. Back trajectories and d-excess suggest that precipitation is transported from the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the Mediterranean Sea. The differences in slopes and intercepts of δ 18 O–δ 2 H regressions with space reveal that evaporation and local recycling regulate the compositional variation of precipitation. The study suggests a strong hydraulic connection between surface water and groundwater and recharge through flowpaths with higher permeability, where the Indian summer monsoon acts as the dominant replenishment input. Using the vertical isotopic gradient of precipitation, the groundwater feeding zones were also determined.",

      "citations": 6,
      "abstract": "Daily and weekly rainfall stable isotopic data, collected over a 9-year period (for daily) and 14-year period (for weekly) at Lucas Heights, Australia, were compared. Small differences in the local meteoric water lines (LMWLs) were seen when developed using daily, weekly, or monthly data (where the effect of short-term small atmospheric variability is reduced by the associated averaging). Although, if a precipitation weighted least squares method was used to derive the LMWLs, the differences between the daily and weekly derived LMWLs were lower. A systematic analysis was then conducted of the impact on the isotopic composition of precipitation from environmental conditions at the sampling site and along the air mass trajectory, the synoptic weather systems, and finally large-scale climate drivers (e.g., El Niño-Southern Oscillation). The best correlation of δ 18 O was with local temperature, rainout of the air mass, and rainfall amount at the site. The correlation between precipitation amount and δ 18 O values was higher when daily samples were used, than when the precipitation weighted monthly values were considered (-0.36 as opposed to −0.31). A good correlation was also seen between δ 18 O and duration of the precipitation event (r = -0.42). The correlation between δ 18 O and the fraction of convective rainfall was significant, but low (r = 0.11). On a synoptic systems basis, the lowest δ values were seen in rainfall from offshore low-pressure systems, located to the east or north-east of the site; although, the largest rainfall was seen from low pressure systems arriving from the north-east. The influence of the large-scale climate drivers on the isotopic composition of precipitation was insignificant at this coastal site. When Radon-222 was used to categorise the atmospheric mixing state, rainfall amount was clearly negatively correlated with nocturnal stability, with the lowest amount of rainfall occurring on days with the most stable nocturnal periods. Most of the convective rainfall occurred on these same days, occurring after the warmer period of the day, although the total rainfall amount was low. Analysing the data within the separate radon-derived stability categories improved the correlations with rainfall amount for some of the stability categories.",

This study assessed the possible consequences of land-use change scenarios (i.e. business as usual, BAU, and afforestation for the year 2025) compared to the 2016 baseline on the Vea catchment’s water balance components using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The data used include daily climate and discharge, soil and land use/land cover maps. The results indicate that the mean annual water yield may increase by 9.1% under the BAU scenario but decrease by 2.7% under the afforestation scenario; actual evapotranspiration would decrease under BAU but increase under afforestation; and groundwater recharge may increase under both scenarios but would be more pronounced under the afforestation scenario. These outcomes highlight the significance of land-cover dynamics in water resource management and planning at the catchment.",

The simulation results verified some negative impacts of LU changes, such as increases in peak discharge and flow velocity from 2001 to 2032 by 57.1% and 39.4%, respectively. Additionally, the time of concentration decreased from 6 h in 2001 to 5 h in 2016 and to 4 h in 2032. Surface runoff recorded the highest increases by 48.4% and 83.9%, respectively, in 2016 and 2032, compared to 2001.

      "abstract": "Watershed-scale hydrology and soil erosion are the main environmental components that are greatly affected by environmental perturbations such as climate and land use and land cover (LULC) changes. The purpose of this study is to assess the impacts of scenario-based LULC change and climate change on hydrology and sediment at the watershed scale in Rib watershed, Ethiopia, using the empirical land-use change model, dynamic conversion of land use and its effects (Dyna-CLUE), and soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). Regional climate model (RCM) with Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) outputs were bias-corrected and future climate from 2025 to 2099 was analyzed to assess climate changes. Analysis of the LULC change indicated that there has been a high increase in cultivated land at the expense of mixed forest and shrublands and a low and gradual increase in plantation and urban lands in the historical periods (1984–2016) and in the predictions (2016–2049). In general, the predicted climate change indicated that there will be a decrease in precipitation in all of the SRES and RCP scenarios except in the Bega (dry) season and an increase in temperature in all of the scenarios. The impact analysis indicated that there might be an increase in runoff, evapotranspiration (ET), sediment yield, and a decrease in lateral flow, groundwater flow, and water yield. The changing climate and LULC result in an increase in soil erosion and changes in surface and groundwater flow, which might have an impact on reducing crop yield, the main source of livelihood in the area. Therefore, short- and long-term watershed-scale resource management activities have to be designed and implemented to minimize erosion and increase groundwater recharge.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 22,
      "abstract": "The upper Yellow River Basin (UYRB) provides more than 50 % of freshwater for the Yellow River. Recent research reveals continuous climatic wetting and vegetation greening over the UYRB in a warming future, but future hydrological drought changes remain unclear due to complex interactions between climate change, land cover change and reservoir operations. Here we project hydrological drought changes at different global warming levels and quantify contributions from each driving factor. The Conjunctive Surface-Subsurface Process eco-hydrological model is coupled with a reservoir module, and the new CSSPv2 + Reservoir model is used to perform future projections driven by bias-corrected meteorological forcings from 11 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models. The CSSPv2 + Reservoir model simulates monthly streamflow over the UYRB reasonably well with a Kling-Gupta efficiency of 0.75. The increasing precipitation during dry seasons reduces hydrological drought duration by 9 %/12 %/19 % at the 1.5°C/2.0°C/4.0°C warming level, while its impact on drought severity is limited. The dramatic increase of leaf area index at the 4.0°C warming level robustly exacerbates hydrological drought severity to 28 % by intensifying evapotranspiration. The reservoir operation, designed to reduce seasonality in monthly releases to ensure stable hydropower generation, further decreases drought duration, but increases drought frequency and severity to 63 %/48 %/108 % and 9 %/11 %/32 % at the 1.5°C/2.0°C/4.0°C warming levels respectively. A mitigated operation rule which stores less water during wet seasons, however, can reduce hydrological drought severity and duration significantly. Thus, future reservoir operations should pay more attention to the trade-off between hydropower generation and hydrological drought mitigation.",

      "abstract": "The Yellow River basin of China has experienced significant land use and land cover change (LUCC) due to excessive exploitation of nature resources, ecological degradation, and rapid urbanization, which plays an important role in the regional climate. It is crucial to explore the climate patterns of the basin under different future development scenarios to mitigate climate issues and achieve “carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals”. Here we utilized land use and land cover (LULC) data and projections of future climate under two shared socioeconomic path – representative concentration path (SSP245 and SSP585) scenarios. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, we simulated four future spatial variation patterns of temperature and precipitation in the basin. Results indicated that under the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, the temperature is projected to increase by 0.18 °C and 0.46 °C, respectively, while precipitation is expected to rise by 32.21 mm and 134.24 mm, respectively. The impact of LUCC was found to be relatively minor and mainly concentrated in the middle reaches of the basin. It resulted in a slight increase in temperature in both scenarios and an increase in precipitation in SSP245, but a decrease in precipitation in SSP585. Changes in farmland and urban area exhibited a certain warming effect in both scenarios, with urban areas having a greater influence, leading to a temperature increase by 0.25 °C and 0.28 °C, respectively. Forest, grassland, and bare areas had a lesser impact on temperature and showed different trends under two scenarios. Regarding precipitation, forests and urban areas had a greater influence in both SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios. This study identified the significant role of LUCC under different development scenarios in shaping future temperature and precipitation changes, providing valuable insights for effectively addressing climate issues in the Yellow River basin. It also highlights the need for clear policy recommendations and identifies institutions or agencies responsible for implementing such recommendations.",

We developed a physics constrained machine learning (ML) model (hybrid model) to estimate latent heat flux (LE), which conserves the surface energy budget. By comparing model predictions with observations at 82 eddy covariance tower sites, our hybrid model shows similar performance to the pure ML model in terms of mean metrics (e.g., mean absolute percent errors) but, importantly, the hybrid model conserves the surface energy balance, while the pure ML model does not. A second key result is that the hybrid model extrapolates much better than the pure ML model, emphasizing the benefits of combining physics with ML for increased generalizations. The hybrid model allows inferring the structural dependence of ET and surface resistance ( r s ), and we find that vegetation height and soil moisture are the main regulators of ET and r s .",

      "abstract": "Accurate forecasts of hourly water levels during typhoons are crucial to disaster emergency response. To mitigate flood damage, the development of a water-level forecasting model has played an essential role. We propose a model based on a dilated causal convolutional neural network (DCCNN) that can yield water-level forecasts with lead times of 1- to 6-h. A DCCNN model can efficiently exploit a broad-range history. Residual and skip connections are also applied throughout the network to enable training of deeper networks and to accelerate convergence. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed forecasting technique, we applied it to a dataset of 16 typhoon events that occurred during the years 2012-2017 in the Yilan River basin in Taiwan. In order to examine the efficiency of the improved methodology, we also compared the proposed model with two existing models that were based on the multilayer perceptron (MLP) and the support vector machine (SVM). The results indicate that a DCCNN-based model is superior to both the SVM and MLP models, especially for modeling peak water levels. Much of the performance improvement of the proposed model is due to its ability to provide water-level forecasts with a long lead time. The proposed model is expected to be particularly useful in support of disaster warning systems.",

      "citations": 34,
      "abstract": "Traditional static neural networks often fail to describe dynamic flood processes, while recurrent neural networks can reflect this dynamic feature of flooding. In this paper, a real-time framework for probabilistic flood forecasting using an Elman neural network is presented. Based on this framework, flood forecasting models with different lead times are developed and trained by a real-time recurrent learning algorithm for forecasting the inflow of the Xianghongdian reservoir of the Huai River in East China. The performances of these models are evaluated. The forecasting model having a 3 h lead time meets the precision requirements and is chosen as the deterministic flood forecasting model. Compared with the multilayer perceptron having a 3 h lead time, the relative error of flood volume is 5.28% less, and the coefficient of efficiency is 0.105 greater. We further analyze the error characteristics of the selected model and derive the discharge probability density function based on the heterogeneity of error distributions. The forecasted discharge intervals with different confidence levels, the expected values, and the median values are obtained. The results show that the average relative errors of flood volume and peak discharge obtained by the median value forecasting are −1.66% and 5.69% respectively, and the coefficient of efficiency is 0.784. The performance of the median value forecasting was slightly better than that of the deterministic forecasting, and considerably better than that of the expected value forecasting. This study demonstrates that the proposed model has high practicability and can provide decision support for flood control.",

Many of the LSMs' soil and vegetation parameters were highly uncertain so that it is crucially important to efficiently optimize them. Here I present a globally applicable and computationally efficient method for parameter optimization and uncertainty assessment of the LSM by combining Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with machine learning. First, I performed the long‐term (decadal‐scale) ensemble simulation of the LSM, in which each ensemble member has different parameters' values, and calculated the gap between simulation and observation, or the cost function, for each ensemble member. Second, I developed the statistical machine learning‐based surrogate model, which is computationally cheap but accurately mimics the relationship between parameters and the cost function, by applying the Gaussian process regression to learn the model simulation. Third, I applied MCMC by repeatedly evaluating the surrogate model to get the posterior probabilistic distribution of parameters. Using satellite passive microwave brightness temperature observations, both synthetic and real‐data experiments in the Sahel region of west Africa were performed to optimize unknown soil and vegetation parameters of the LSM. The primary findings are (1) the proposed method is 50,000 times as fast as the direct application of MCMC to the full LSM; (2) the skill of the LSM to simulate both soil moisture and vegetation dynamics can be improved; and (3) I successfully quantify the characteristics of equifinality by obtaining the full nonparametric probabilistic distribution of parameters.",

A machine learning approach, namely the long short-term memory units (LSTM) was adopted to improve the GHMs-based flood simulations within a hybrid physics- machine learning approach (using basin-averaged daily mean air temperature, precipitation, wind speed and the simulated daily discharge from GHMs-CaMa-Flood model chain as the inputs of LSTM, and observed daily discharge as the output value). We found that the GHMs perform reasonably well in terms of amplitude of peak discharge but are relatively poor in terms of their timing. The performance indicated great discrepancy under different climate zones. The large difference in performance between GHMs and observations reflected that those simulations require improvements. The LSTM used in combination with those GHMs was then shown to drastically improve the performance of global flood simulations (especially in terms of amplitude of peak discharge), suggesting that the combination of classical flood simulation and machine learning techniques might be a way forward for more robust and confident flood risk assessment.",

      "abstract": "We recently addressed data-driven monthly streamflow forecasting using a decomposition-based model that relies on Fourier transform (FT) to decompose the monthly streamflow time series into 4 components, with each component comprising of contiguous frequencies and being forecasted independently by support vector regression (SVR). The model, called FT-SVR, is capable of achieving near-perfect monthly inflow forecasting for China’s Three Gorges Dam (TGD). In this paper, we adapt FT-SVR to 10-day streamflow forecasting and the TGD is still taken as the case for study. The 10-day inflow time series is decomposed into 7 components, and each component contains an appropriate small number of contiguous frequencies. We also investigate forecasting each decomposed component by extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and the investigated model is accordingly named as FT-XGBoost. XGBoost uses an ensemble of trees as the input–output mapping. The maximum number of iterations for solving convex quadratic programming in SVR is considerably reduced and the parameter calibration process to develop each independent SVR or XGBoost model is enhanced. We compare FT-SVR and FT-XGBoost on three different decomposition strategies: the centered 10-day inflow time series, 4 decomposed components like our previous work, and 7 components. Experimental results on the TGD case study demonstrate that FT-SVR with the decomposition strategy of 7 components is able to derive again near-perfect 10-day streamflow forecasting results, significantly better than FT-SVR with the other decomposition strategies and FT-XGBoost with all the decomposition strategies, while with parameter calibration being performed as efficiently as FT-XGBoost on each decomposition strategy.",

      "abstract": "Hydrological forecasting is key for water resources allocation and flood risk management. Although a number of advanced hydrological forecasting methods have been developed in the past, daily (or subdaily) forecasting remains a major challenge in engineering hydrology. The uncertainties associated with input data, model parameters, and model structure necessitate developing more robust modeling techniques. In this study, a hybrid machine-learning approach based on hydrological and data-driven modeling is developed for daily streamflow forecasting. The proposed hybrid hydrological data-driven model (HHDD) approach succeeds in improving daily prediction compared to that predicted by the standard conceptual hydrological model (HYMOD). In addition, the developed HHDD model is more robust in terms of providing direct uncertainty analysis results. The results indicate that a better resemblance of streamflow pattern is achieved by integrating physically based and data-driven approaches into the developed HHDD model.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 66,
      "abstract": "Stochastic simulation has been employed for producing long-term records and assessing the impact of climate change on hydrological and climatological variables in the future. However, traditional stochastic simulation of hydroclimatological variables often underestimates the variability and correlation structure of larger timescale due to the preservation of long-term memory. However, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, one type of recurrent neural network (RNN), employed in different fields, exhibits a remarkable long-term memory characteristic owing to the recursive hidden and cell states. The current study, therefore, applied the LSTM model to the stochastic simulation of hydroclimatological variables to examine how good the LSTM model can preserve the long-term memory and overcome the drawbacks of conventional time series models. The simulation involved a trigonometric function and the Rössler system as well as real case studies for hydrological and climatological variables. Results showed that the LSTM model reproduced the variability and correlation structure of the larger timescale as well as the key statistics of the original time domain better than the traditional models. The hidden and cell states of the LSTM containing the long-memory and oscillation structure following the observations allows better performance compared to the other tested conventional models. This better representation of the long-term variability can be critical in water manager since future water resources planning and management is highly related with this long-term variability. Thus, it is concluded that the LSTM model can be a potential alternative for the stochastic simulation of hydroclimatological variables. Also, note that another long-term memory model such as Gated Recurrent Unit can be also applicable.",

      "abstract": "Rainfall-runoff modeling is a complex nonlinear time series problem. While there is still room for improvement, researchers have been developing physical and machine learning models for decades to predict runoff using rainfall data sets. With the advancement of computational hardware resources and algorithms, deep learning methods such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) model and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modeling have shown a good deal of promise in dealing with time series problems by considering long-term dependencies and multiple outputs. This study presents an application of a prediction model based on LSTM and the seq2seq structure to estimate hourly rainfall-runoff. Focusing on two Midwestern watersheds, namely, Clear Creek and Upper Wapsipinicon River in Iowa, these models were used to predict hourly runoff for a 24-hr period using rainfall observation, rainfall forecast, runoff observation, and empirical monthly evapotranspiration data from all stations in these two watersheds. The models were evaluated using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, the correlation coefficient, statistical bias, and the normalized root-mean-square error. The results show that the LSTM-seq2seq model outperforms linear regression, Lasso regression, Ridge regression, support vector regression, Gaussian processes regression, and LSTM in all stations from these two watersheds. The LSTM-seq2seq model shows sufficient predictive power and could be used to improve forecast accuracy in short-term flood forecast applications. In addition, the seq2seq method was demonstrated to be an effective method for time series predictions in hydrology.",

      "journal": "Water",
      "citations": 190,
      "abstract": "Runoff modeling is one of the key challenges in the field of hydrology. Various approaches exist, ranging from physically based over conceptual to fully data driven models. In this paper, we propose a data driven approach using the state-of-the-art Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) network. The proposed model was applied in the Poyang Lake Basin (PYLB) and its performance was compared with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). We first tested the impacts of the number of previous time step (window size) in simulation accuracy. Results showed that a window in improper large size will dramatically deteriorate the model performance. In terms of PYLB, a window size of 15 days might be appropriate for both accuracy and computational efficiency. We then trained the model with 2 different input datasets, namely, dataset with precipitation only and dataset with all available meteorological variables. Results demonstrate that although LSTM with precipitation data as the only input can achieve desirable results (where the NSE ranged from 0.60 to 0.92 for the test period), the performance can be improved simply by feeding the model with more meteorological variables (where NSE ranged from 0.74 to 0.94 for the test period). Moreover, the comparison results with the ANN and the SWAT showed that the ANN can get comparable performance with the SWAT in most cases whereas the performance of LSTM is much better. The results of this study underline the potential of the LSTM for runoff modeling especially for areas where detailed topographical data are not available.",

      "citations": 341,
      "abstract": "Operational flood control systems depend on reliable and accurate forecasts with a suitable lead time to take necessary actions against flooding. This study proposed a Long Short-Term Memory based Encoder-Decoder (LSTM-ED) model for multi-step-ahead flood forecasting for the first time. The Shihmen Reservoir catchment in Taiwan constituted the case study. A total of 12,216 hourly hydrological data collected from 23 typhoon events were allocated into three datasets for model training, validation, and testing. The input sequence of the model contained hourly reservoir inflows and rainfall data (traced back to the previous 8 h) of ten gauge stations, and the output sequence stepped into 1- up to 6-hour-ahead reservoir inflow forecasts. A feed forward neural network-based Encoder-Decoder (FFNN-ED) model was established for comparison purposes. This study conducted model training a number of times with various initial weights to evaluate the accuracy, stability, and reliability of the constructed FFNN-ED and LSTM-ED models. The results demonstrated that both models, in general, could provide suitable multi-step ahead forecasts, and the proposed LSTM-ED model not only could effectively mimic the long-term dependence between rainfall and runoff sequences but also could make more reliable and accurate flood forecasts than the FFNN-ED model. Concerning the time delay between the time horizons of model inputs (rainfall) and model outputs (runoff), the impact assessment of this time-delay on model performance indicated that the LSTM-ED model achieved similar forecast performance when fed with antecedent rainfall either at a shorter horizon of 4 h in the past (T − 4) or at horizons longer than 7 h in the past (>T − 7). We conclude that the proposed LSTM-ED that translates and links the rainfall sequence with the runoff sequence can improve the reliability of flood forecasting and increase the interpretability of model internals.",

Motivated by the pressing need to understand, from a hydro-ecological perspective, how the dynamic nature of the hydrologiccycle will impact the environment in water-stressed regions, we implemented a novel approach that predicts precipitation spatio-temporaltrends over the drought-burdened region of East Africa, based on other major hydrological components, such as vegetation water content(VWC), soil moisture (SM) and surface temperature (ST). The spatial patterns and characteristics of the inter-relations among the fouraforementioned hydrologic variables were investigated over regions of East Africa characterized by different vegetation types and forvarious precipitation intensity rates during 2003-2011. To this end, we analyzed multi-year satellite microwave remote sensing observa-tions of SM, ST, and VWC (derived from Naval Research Laboratory's WindSat radiometer) as well as their response to precipitationpatterns (derived from NASA's TRMM 3B42 V7). We categorized precipitation into four bins (ranges) of intensity and trained fivedifferent state-of-the-art machine learning models for each of these categories. The models were then applied to predict the spatio-temporal precipitation dynamics over this complex region. Specifically, the Random Forest and Linear Regression models outperformedthe others with the normalized mean absolute error being less than 27% for all of the categories. The characteristics of the predicted pre-cipitation were in turn used to classify vegetation regimes in East Africa. Our results indicate significant discrepancies in the performanceof the models with varying values in the predicting skill as well as their ability to accurately classify vegetation into different types. Ourpredictive models were able to forecast the three vegetation regimes, i.e., Forest/Woody Savanna, Savanna/Grasslands and Shrubland,with precision rate of at least 81% for all of the aforementioned precipitation bins.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 178,
      "abstract": "To improve the accuracy of quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), numerous models have been developed for merging satellite and gauge precipitation. However, most established merging methods consider the spatial or temporal correlation between satellite data and rain gauge data separately, and the produced merged precipitation is still limited by low spatial resolution and regional inaccuracy. In this study, a deep fusion model is proposed to merge the TRMM 3B42 V7 satellite data, rain gauge data and thermal infrared images by exploiting their spatial and temporal correlations simultaneously. Specifically, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is combined with a long-short-term memory network (LSTM), where the spatial characteristics of satellite, rain gauge and thermal infrared data are extracted by CNN, while their time dependence is captured by LSTM. Experiment results on 796 rain gauges in China show that the proposed CNN-LSTM model outperforms the comparative models (CNN, LSTM, Multi-Layer Perception). It can improve the accuracy of the original TRMM data in China (reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) by 17.0% and 14.7%, respectively and increasing the Correlation Coefficient to 0.72), even for different precipitation intensities and gauge sparse regions. Finally, a dataset of merged daily precipitation from 2001 to 2005 with a higher resolution of 0.05° and higher accuracy over China is produced. This study provides a useful tool and a valuable dataset for QPE in China, which would benefit water research and water resource management.",

      "abstract": "Rainfall-runoff modelling is one of the key challenges in the field of hydrology. Various approaches exist, ranging from physically based over conceptual to fully data-driven models. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach, using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a special type of recurrent neural network. The advantage of the LSTM is its ability to learn long-term dependencies between the provided input and output of the network, which are essential for modelling storage effects in e.g. catchments with snow influence. We use 241 catchments of the freely available CAMELS data set to test our approach and also compare the results to the well-known Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model (SAC-SMA) coupled with the Snow-17 snow routine. We also show the potential of the LSTM as a regional hydrological model in which one model predicts the discharge for a variety of catchments. In our last experiment, we show the possibility to transfer process understanding, learned at regional scale, to individual catchments and thereby increasing model performance when compared to a LSTM trained only on the data of single catchments. Using this approach, we were able to achieve better model performance as the SAC-SMA + Snow-17, which underlines the potential of the LSTM for hydrological modelling applications.",

      "citations": 69,
      "abstract": "Urban flooding is a critical challenge in metropolitan cities around the world; thus, urban flood forecasting is required to support water-related managers in mitigating damage. Nevertheless, the accuracy of rainfall forecasting systems remains limited; for example, the predictions of radar-based systems are often inaccurate for heavy rainfall events. This study proposes a framework that couples a forecasting system and a developed 1D/2D urban hydrological model to predict water levels and inundation phenomena in an urban catchment. In the framework, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network uses the quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) of the McGill Algorithm for Precipitation nowcasting by Lagrangian Extrapolation (MAPLE) system to reproduce three-hour mean areal precipitation (MAP) forecasts. A coupled 1D/2D urban hydrological model was also developed in this study. The Gangnam urban catchment located in Seoul, South Korea, was selected as a case study for the proposed framework. To train and test the LSTM model, a database was established based on 24 heavy rainfall events, 22 grid points from the MAPLE system and the observed MAP values estimated from five ground rain gauges. The corrected MAP forecasts were input into the developed coupled model to predict water levels and relevant inundation areas. The results indicate the viability of the proposed framework for generating three-hour MAP forecasts and urban flooding predictions. This study demonstrates that despite slightly underestimating extreme values of rainfall and peak water levels for certain events, the framework has high practicability and can be used to improve MAP forecasts and urban inundation forecasts.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 202,
      "abstract": "Reliable and accurate streamflow forecasting is vital for water resource management. Many streamflow prediction studies have demonstrated the excellent prediction ability of decomposition ensemble models. Several studies first extracted subsignals from a streamflow series and then split subsignals into training and validation sets to build prediction models, capturing some future information not available in practical streamflow forecasting. Alternatively, dividing a time series into training and validation sets first and later decomposing them into subsignals can expose the subsignals to the boundary effect, making predicting streamflow difficult. Furthermore, building one model for each subsignal is laborious and can cause error accumulation. Therefore, establishing a robust and efficient decomposition ensemble model without future information to predict highly nonstationary and nonlinear streamflow is challenging. Hence, a single-model forecasting (SF) scheme that assesses the validation distribution during the training stage to adapt to the boundary effect was designed. A SF scheme based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and long short-term memory (LSTM), namely, SF-VMD-LSTM, was proposed to predict daily streamflow 1–7 days ahead. Non-decomposition-based and decomposition-ensemble-based LSTM models established using SF, multi-model ensemble forecasting (MEF) and SF with the most influential subsignals (SFMIS) and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) were compared. Additionally, multi-model ensemble hindcasting (MEH), single-model hindcasting (SH) and SH with the most influential subsignals (SHMIS) were used as benchmarks to evaluate the forecasting schemes’ adaptability to the boundary effect. Two daily streamflow series from Han River and Jing River, China, were investigated. The results indicate that (1) SF is more robust and efficient than MEF and SFMIS; (2) VMD performs better than EEMD and DWT; (3) SF-VMD-LSTM, with NSE values larger than 0.8 for almost all the prediction scenarios, outperformed other comparative models. Therefore, SF-VMD-LSTM is robust and efficient for forecasting highly nonstationary and nonlinear streamflow.",

      "abstract": "Rainfall and runoff are considered the main components in the hydrological cycle. Developing an accurate model to capture the dynamic connection between rainfall and runoff remains a problematic task for engineers. Several studies have been carried out to develop models to accurately predict the changes in runoff from rainfall. However, these models have limitations in terms of accuracy and complexity when large numbers of parameters are needed. Therefore, recently, with the advancement of data-driven techniques, a vast number of hydrologists have adopted models to predict changes in runoff. However, data-driven models still encounter several limitations related to hyperparameter optimization and overfitting. Hence, there is a need to improve these models to overcome these limitations. In this study, data-driven techniques such as a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) are integrated with an advanced nature-inspired optimizer, namely, Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) to model the rainfall-runoff relationship. Five different scenarios will be examined based on the autocorrelation function (ACF), cross-correlation function (CCF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF). Finally, for comprehensive analysis, the performance of the proposed model will then be compared with integrated data-driven techniques with particle swarm optimization (PSO). The results revealed that all the augmented models with HHO outperformed other integrated models with PSO in predicting the changes in runoff. In addition, a high level of accuracy in predicting runoff values was achieved when HHO was integrated with LSSVM.",

      "abstract": "Forecasting water level is an extremely important task as it allows to mitigate the effects of floods, reduce and prevent disasters. Physically based models often give good results but they require expensive computational time and various types of hydro-geomorphological data to develop the forecasting system. Alternatively, data driven forecasting models are usually faster and easier to build. During the past decades, statistical machine learning (ML) methods have greatly contributed to the advancement of data driven forecasting systems that provide cost-effective solutions and better performance. Meanwhile, Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) is one of the famous linear statistical models for time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that takes advantages of linear and nonlinear models. The proposed method combines statistical machine learning algorithms and ARIMA for forecasting water level. Observed water level of the Red river at the Vu Quang, Hanoi (3 hourly sampled from 2008 to 2017) and Hung Yen hydrological stations (hourly collected data from 2008 to 4/2015) are used to evaluate the performance of different methods. Experimental results on these 3 real big datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid models.",

      "abstract": "In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach is proposed to assess flood susceptibility for urban catchment. Nine explanatory factors covering precipitation, topographical, and anthropogenic aspects were selected and two CNNs, SCNN and LeNet-5, were implemented to identify the relationship between the explanatory factors and flood inventory between 2004 and 2014 in the Dahongmen catchment in Beijing, China. The performance of the CNNs was compared with that of support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) models for three model input strategies (point-based, array-based and imaged-based strategies). The results showed that: (1) The two CNNs performed better than the SVM and RF, with an accuracy of 0.90 for SCNN and 0.88 for Lenet-5 in the testing period. (2) The CNN-based approach provided more reliable flood susceptibility maps than the comparative models with the highest area under the curve (AUC) index of 0.9 validating by another flood inventory. (3) The upstream inundations induced by pluvial flood cannot be accurately identified by using point-based and array-based strategies. These errors were corrected by considering topographical information using the imaged-based CNN approach. (4) The fixed architecture LeNet-5 produced satisfactory results and avoided the time-consuming process of architecture selection of CNN. We conclude that the proposed CNN-based approach is a valid approach and provides a high-quality susceptibility map for urban mitigation and flood management.",

      "citations": 43,
      "abstract": "Precipitation regionalization deals with an investigation of the seasonality and its temporal variability and is useful for a wide variety of applications in hydro-meteorology. The d homogeneous regions can be used as a basis for transforming the information from gauged to ungauged sites and can reduce the uncertainty in estimating the seasonal characteristics of precipitation across India. Despite several studies stressing the importance of seasonality and temporal variability to the environment, there is a lack of studies on accounting for temporal variability in regionalization. Precipitation regionalization must account for both the precipitation magnitude and its temporal variability at multiple time-scales to extract the seasonality of a region representing coherent local and inter-annual variability. Therefore, in this study, we propose a framework for precipitation regionalization, considering both precipitation magnitude and its temporal variability. High resolution (0.25° × 0.25°) gridded daily precipitation time series over the period 1901–2013 from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) was used for the evaluation of the framework. First, the historical daily time series was transformed into multiple time scales, i.e., annual, seasonal, and monthly time scales. Entropy-based standardized variability index was used to measure the inter-annual variability of precipitation at each time scale. Regionalization of grid points was performed using self-organizing maps, an artificial neural network. Ten distinct regions were identified that can be tied back to two general categories, such as climate characteristics and physical characteristics. Coupling of the self-organizing map with standardized variability index reveals unique seasonal distribution of precipitation for each region. The temporal evolution of clusters unravels a new emerging pattern across Central India. Consideration of temporal variability plays an insignificant role in the shape, size and stability of south-central India, south-eastern coastlines, and Konkan Coast. Intriguingly, separate Rain-belt and Rain-shadow Western Himalayas are formed due to the difference in topography and seasonal characteristics of precipitation. The temporal evolution of clusters unravels a significant change in the occurrence of the 50th percentile monsoon after the 1940s across the north-western region; a significant increase in the 50th percentile monsoon after the 1940s across western India, and decrease in the 50th percentile monsoon after the 1980s in the north-central Region.",

      "abstract": "The machine learning algorithm ‘random forest’ has been applied in many areas of water resources research including discharge simulation. Due to low setup and operation cost, random forest could represent an alternative approach to physical and conceptual hydrological models for large-scale hazard assessment in multiple catchments. Yet, the applicability of random forest to flood discharge simulation requires further exploration, especially with respect to heterogeneous catchments and daily temporal resolution. In this study, we simulate flood event and peak discharge on a daily time scale for 95 study basins in Canada and the USA. We comparatively evaluate the predictive performance of random forest against the conceptual hydrological modeling package ‘hydromad’ and assess the influence of catchment characteristics on model performance. Our analysis showed that random forest is competitive to hydromad in the simulation of low and medium flood magnitudes. However, both models exhibit inaccuracies for higher flood events. Relating catchment characteristics to model skill, we found that primarily climatic conditions and elevation affect the flood simulation capability. We conclude that random forest provides a low-cost and, yet, competitive alternative to conventional rainfall-runoff models in large-scale flood discharge simulation. Nevertheless, without further model advancements, the presented models only provide robust discharge predictions for small and medium magnitude floods in low altitude catchments with warm temperate climate.",

      "abstract": "Flood quantile estimation at sites with little or no data is important for the adequate planning and management of water resources. Regional Hydrological Frequency Analysis (RFA) deals with the estimation of hydrological variables at ungauged sites. Random Forest (RF) is an ensemble learning technique which uses multiple Classification and Regression Trees (CART) for classification, regression, and other tasks. The RF technique is gaining popularity in a number of fields because of its powerful non-linear and non-parametric nature. In the present study, we investigate the use of Random Forest Regression (RFR) in the estimation step of RFA based on a case study represented by data collected from 151 hydrometric stations from the province of Quebec, Canada. RFR is applied to the whole data set and to homogeneous regions of stations delineated by canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Using the Out-of-bag error rate feature of RF, the optimal number of trees for the dataset is calculated. The results of the application of the CCA based RFR model (CCA-RFR) are compared to results obtained with a number of other linear and non-linear RFA models. CCA-RFR leads to the best performance in terms of root mean squared error. The use of CCA to delineate neighborhoods improves considerably the performance of RFR. RFR is found to be simple to apply and more efficient than more complex models such as Artificial Neural Network-based models.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 94,
      "abstract": "Hydrologic models are commonly used to assess climate change impact on water resources. Several studies have reported that hydrologic models often experience severe performance degradation under climatic conditions different from calibration periods. With the advancement of artificial intelligence technology, the long short-term memory (LSTM) network has recently shown great potentials in rainfall-runoff modeling. However, little is known about the robustness of the LSTM network when used in changing climatic conditions. In this study, we compare the robustness of the LSTM network and two conceptual hydrologic models in runoff prediction in changing climatic conditions in 278 Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) basins. For calibration periods, the two hydrologic models have better performance in wet periods than in dry periods, while the LSTM network shows little performance difference under different climatic conditions. For validation periods, the three models suffer the largest performance loss when calibrated in a wet period and validated in a dry period. The performance losses of the LSTM network are primarily affected by the climate contrast between calibration and validation periods, while the performance losses of the two hydrologic models are mainly dependent on the climatic condition of validation periods. We also find that the length of the calibration period is an important factor affecting the relative performance of the models. Increasing the length of the calibration period has little effect on the validation performance of the two hydrologic models but enhances the LSTM network's performance. If sufficient calibration data is available, the LSTM network is a preferred tool for runoff simulation. On the other hand, the hydrologic models could have more advantages over the LSTM network in case of limited calibration data available.",

      "abstract": "Due to the drought negative impacts, accurate forecasting of drought indices is important. This study focused on the short- to long-term Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) forecasting in sites with different climates using newly integrated hybrid pre-post-processing techniques. Four sites in Iran's northwest were selected and the SPIs series with time scales of 3, 9, and 24 months were forecasted during the period of 1978–2017. For improving the modeling efficiency, wavelet transform and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) pre-processing methods were used. In this regard, temporal features of the SPIs series were decomposed via wavelet transform (WT), then, the obtained sub-series were further broken down into intrinsic mode functions using EEMD. Also, simple linear averaging and nonlinear neural ensemble post-processing methods were applied to ensemble the outputs of hybrid models. The results showed that data pre-processing enhanced the models' capability up to 40%. Also, integrated pre-post-processing models improved the models' efficiency by approximately 50%. The root mean square errors' criteria distribution range decreased from 0.337–1.03 (in raw data) to 0.195–0.714 (in decomposed data). The results proved the capability of applied methods in modeling the SPIs series. In increasing the models' accuracy, data pre-processing was more effective than data post-processing.",

      "journal": "Science of the Total Environment",
      "citations": 105,
      "abstract": "Agricultural water demand, groundwater extraction, surface water delivery and climate have complex nonlinear relationships with groundwater storage in agricultural regions. As an alternative to elaborate computationally intensive physical models, machine learning methods are often adopted as surrogate to capture such complex relationships due to their high computational efficiency. Inevitably, using only one machine learning model is prone to underestimate prediction uncertainty and subjected to poor accuracy. This study presents a novel machine learning-based groundwater ensemble modeling framework in conjunction with a Bayesian model averaging approach to predict groundwater storage change and improve overall model predicting reliability. Three different machine learning models have been developed namely artificial neural network, support vector machine and response surface regression. To explicitly quantify uncertainty from machine learning model parameter and structure, Bayesian model averaging is employed to produce a forecast distribution associated with each machine learning prediction. Model weights and variances are obtained based on model performance to construct ensemble models. Then, the developed individual and Bayesian model averaging machine learning ensemble models are applied, evaluated and validated at different spatial scales including subregional and regional scales in an overdrafted agricultural region-the San Joaquin River Basin, through independent training and testing dataset. Results shows the machine learning models have remarkable predicting capability without sacrificing accuracy but with higher computational efficiency. Compared to a single-model approach, the ensemble model is able to produce consistently reliable predictions across the basin, yet it does not always outperform the best model in the ensemble. Additionally, model results suggest that groundwater pumping for agricultural irrigation is the primary driving force of groundwater storage change across the region. The modeling framework can serve as an alternative approach to simulating groundwater response, especially in those agricultural regions where lack of subsurface data hinders physically-based modeling.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) has been applied to predict daily runoff, as its wonderful ability of dealing with the high nonlinear interactions among the complex hydrology factors. However, most of the existing studies focused on the model structure and the computational load, without considering the impact from the selection of multiple input variables on the model prediction. This article presents a study to evaluate this influence and provides a method of identifying the best meteorological input variables for a run off model. Rainfall data and multiple meteorological data have been considered as input to the model. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been applied to the data as a contrast, to reduce dimensionality and redundancy within this input data. Two different deep RNN models, a long-short term memory (LSTM) model and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model, were comparatively applied to predict runoff with these inputs. In this study, the Muskegon river and the Pearl river were taken as examples. The results demonstrate that the selection of input variables have a great influence on the predictions made using the RNN while the RNN model with multiple meteorological input data is shown to achieve higher accuracy than rainfall data alone. PCA method can improve the accuracy of deep RNN model effectively as it can reflect core information by classifying the original data information into several comprehensive variables.",

One aspect of flood prediction which has yet to benefit from machine learning techniques is in the prediction of flood extent. However, due to the many factors that can cause flooding, developing predictive models that can generalise to other potential flooding locations has proven to be a difficult task. This paper shows that a Multi-Input ConvLSTM can exploit several flood conditioning factors to effectively model flood extent while generalising well to other flood locations under certain conditions. Furthermore, this study compares the sub-components of the system to demonstrate their efficacy when applied to various flood types.",

      "journal": "Advances in Water Resources",
      "citations": 75,
      "abstract": "The inherent complexity of the fluid flow in subsurface systems brings potential inevitable uncertainty in their characterization. Computationally intensive high-dimensional inversion problems often emerge in solving the fluid flow problems of various scenarios, which required to be probed. To improve the efficiency of solving such problems, surrogate strategies are widely used to quantify the uncertainty of underground multiphase flow models. In this paper, a deep learning surrogate model is developed for predicting the time-dependent dynamic multiphase flow in a two-dimensional (2D) channelized geological system. The surrogate model is combined with a residual U-net and an autoregressive strategy, which considers the output at the previous time step as input and predict the output at the current time step. The residual U-net has a symmetric network structure similar to U-net and contains extra residual units. The rich skip connections in the network can promote information dissemination and achieve better prediction performance with fewer parameters. We demonstrated the performance of the autoregressive residual U-net (AR-Runet) for predicting the migration of solute transport in heterogeneous 2D binary model. The result shows the AR-Runet surrogate model can provide an accurate approximation of saturation and pressure fields at different times. We also have demonstrated that with the autoregressive strategy this network can achieve similar predict results with relatively less training data. The performance of the AR-Runet network is also compared with the autoregressive Dense net (AR-Dense). The findings indicate that the AR-Runet can provide effective measures for developing surrogate model and uncertainty analysis in dynamic multiphase flow predictions of subsurface systems.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrometeorology",
      "citations": 75,
      "abstract": "Hydrologic predictions at rural watersheds are important but also challenging due to data shortage. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are a promising machine learning approach and have demonstrated good performance in streamflow predictions. However, due to its data-hungry nature, most LSTM applications focus on well-monitored catchments with abundant and high-quality observations. In this work, we investigate predictive capabilities of LSTM in poorly monitored watersheds with short observation records. To address three main challenges of LSTM applications in data-scarce locations, i.e., overfitting, uncertainty quantification (UQ), and out-of-distribution prediction, we evaluate different regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, apply a Bayesian LSTM for UQ, and introduce a physics-informed hybrid LSTM to enhance out-of-distribution prediction. Through case studies in two diverse sets of catchments with and without snow influence, we demonstrate that 1) when hydrologic variability in the prediction period is similar to the calibration period, LSTM models can reasonably predict daily streamflow with Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency above 0.8, even with only 2 years of calibration data; 2) when the hydrologic variability in the prediction and calibration periods is dramatically different, LSTM alone does not predict well, but the hybrid model can improve the out-of-distribution prediction with acceptable generalization accuracy; 3) L2 norm penalty and dropout can mitigate overfitting, and Bayesian and hybrid LSTM have no overfitting; and 4) Bayesian LSTM provides useful uncertainty information to improve prediction understanding and credibility. These insights have vital implications for streamflow simulation in watersheds where data quality and availability are a critical issue.",

A geo-spatial database, with eight flood influencing factors, namely, rainfall, elevation, slope, distance from nearest stream, evapotranspiration, land surface temperature, normalised difference vegetation index and curve number, was developed for 2000, 2006 and 2016. XGBoost performed the best, with the highest mean area under curve score of 0.83. Hence, XGBoost was adopted to simulate the future flood locations corresponding to probable highest rainfall events under four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), namely, 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 along with other flood influencing factors for 2040, 2056, 2050 and 2064, respectively.

      "abstract": "A recent nonlinear and multiscale framework, the Wavelet Data-Driven Forecasting Framework (WDDFF), was proposed for water resources forecasting. The main objective of this study is to explore the WDDFF for short-term urban water demand (UWD) forecasting over multiple lead times (1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h ahead) by focusing on two separate issues that have yet to be considered within the framework: 1) a comparison of artificial neural network (ANN), least squares support vector machines (LSSVM), regularized extreme learning machines (RELM), and random forest (RF) and 2) two dataset partitioning approaches for reducing overfitting in deterministic and probabilistic machine learning (ML) models, a permutation-based approach for the deterministic models and a bootstrap-based approach for the probabilistic models. The secondary objective is to evaluate the usefulness of an input variable selection approach based on RF (RFIVS) for identifying the most important inputs to use in the ML models. The results of a real-world UWD forecasting case study in Qom, Iran demonstrate several noteworthy findings: 1) the probabilistic RF and its 'best' wavelet-based version provided the most accurate and reliable forecasts, with average test set Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency Index (NASH) coefficients (i.e., across all lead times) of ∼ 0.80 and 0.81, respectively; 2) the permutation- and bootstrap-based dataset partitioning approaches demonstrated potential to reduce overfitting; 3) wavelet decomposition improved probabilistic and deterministic ML model performance, increasing test set NASH coefficients by 1–7% on average (across all lead times); 4) wavelet-based models provided approximately the same level of reliability as the non-wavelet-based models but the best performing wavelet-based models improved forecast sharpness by an average of 14–24% (across all lead times); and 5) RFIVS substantially reduced the number of input variables used in the ML models (e.g., the number of inputs used in the wavelet-based models was often reduced by 50%) while still leading to improved performance over the case where all input variables were used.",

      "abstract": "Ahead forecasting of daily reference evapotranspiration (ET 0 ) is of great significance for real-time irrigation decision-making, water resources allocation and hydrological drought assessment. This study for the first time evaluated the forecasting performances of 16 d ahead daily weather variables and subsequent ET 0 at 51 weather stations across various climatic zones of China using the Global Ensemble Reforecast v2 Data provided by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) model. Particularly, a novel machine learning model, i.e., extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), was proposed to downscale and bias correct the GEFS forecasts. The results showed that the GEFS forecasts downscaled by the XGBoost model were more accurate than those downscaled by the inverse distance weighting (IDW) and equidistant cumulative distribution functions matching (EDCDFm) methods, with decreases in mean RMSE of maximum temperature (T max ), minimum temperature (T min ), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (W s ) and solar radiation (R s ) by 36.2%, 33.5%, 35.7%, 75.0% and 27.0%, and by 11.2%, 13.3%, 14.0%, 26.4% and 13.2%, resulting in decreases in mean RMSE of ET 0 by 35.0% and 18.2%, respectively. The overall forecasting performance of T min (NRMSE = 0.14–0.27, R 2 = 0.82–0.95) was best, followed by T max (NRMSE = 0.11–0.26, R 2 = 0.74–0.94), R s (NRMSE = 0.23–0.41, R 2 = 0.34–0.77), RH (NRMSE = 0.18–0.26, R 2 = 0.27–0.72) and finally W s (NRMSE = 0.34–0.46, R 2 = 0.22–0.58), and their forecasting performances decreased with the increase in lead time. Nationally averaged RMSE values of daily ET 0 for 16 d lead time (1.0 mm d −1 ) and 8 d lead time (0.9 mm d −1 ) were approximately 1.7 and 1.5 times of that for 1 d lead time (0.6 mm d −1 ), respectively. Average R 2 values of ET 0 across China varied 0.56–0.85 for 1–16 d lead times, while the corresponding NRMSE values ranged 0.22–0.38, with more accurate ET 0 estimates in the temperate continental zone (TCZ) and mountain plateau zone (MPZ) than the temperate monsoon zone (TMZ) and (sub)tropical monsoon zone (SMZ). The forecasting performance of seasonal ET 0 was generally better in summer, followed by autumn, spring and winter. The greatest reduction in the forecasting performance of daily ET 0 was produced by the forecasting error of R s in all climatic zones, followed by W s , T max and RH in TCZ and MPZ, and by RH, W s and T max in TMZ and SMZ; however, the influence of T min was marginal in all climatic zones. The results indicated that daily ET 0 across China can be satisfactorily forecasted using the GEFS outputs downscaled by the XGBoost model, particularly for 1–8 d lead times.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning methods have recently shown a broad application prospect in rainfall-runoff modeling. However, the lack of physical mechanism becomes a major limitation in using machine learning methods that rely on the available labeled observations. To address this issue, the study proposes that synthetic samples are added to train the deep learning network by using three previously undiscussed physical mechanisms as follows: (1) extreme heavy rainfalls when the soil water is saturated, (2) long-duration rainless events when soil water is exhausted, and (3) the monotonic relationship between rainfall and runoff. A physics-guided Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, shortly named PHY-LSTM, is then formulated. PHY-LSTM network is trained on 531 basins of the Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) dataset, indicating that the performance is significantly improved compared to conventional LSTM. Specifically, the mean Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) improves from 0.52 to 0.61 from the daily simulations during the testing period in local models. It is demonstrated that synthetic samples can effectively improve the simulation of flood peaks and reduce the number of negative streamflow, and strong monotonicity is still maintained even if a slight disturbance is involved in the training dataset. The proposed PHY-LSTM shows that physical mechanisms are very useful to improve efficiencies of the data-driven rainfall-runoff model.",

      "citations": 139,
      "abstract": "Long short‐term memory (LSTM) networks represent one of the most prevalent deep learning (DL) architectures in current hydrological modeling, but they remain black boxes from which process understanding can hardly be obtained. This study aims to demonstrate the potential of interpretive DL in gaining scientific insights using flood prediction across the contiguous United States (CONUS) as a case study. Two interpretation methods were adopted to decipher the machine‐captured patterns and inner workings of LSTM networks. The DL interpretation by the expected gradients method revealed three distinct input‐output relationships learned by LSTM‐based runoff models in 160 individual catchments. These relationships correspond to three flood‐inducing mechanisms—snowmelt, recent rainfall, and historical rainfall—that account for 10.1%, 60.9%, and 29.0% of the 20,908 flow peaks identified from the data set, respectively. Single flooding mechanisms dominate 70.7% of the investigated catchments (11.9% snowmelt‐dominated, 34.4% recent rainfall‐dominated, and 24.4% historical rainfall‐dominated mechanisms), and the remaining 29.3% have mixed mechanisms. The spatial variability in the dominant mechanisms reflects the catchments' geographic and climatic conditions. Moreover, the additive decomposition method unveils how the LSTM network behaves differently in retaining and discarding information when emulating different types of floods. Information from inputs within previous time steps can be partially stored in the memory of LSTM networks to predict snowmelt‐induced and historical rainfall‐induced floods, while for recent rainfall‐induced floods, only recent information is retained. Overall, this study provides a new perspective for understanding hydrological processes and extremes and demonstrates the prospect of artificial intelligence‐assisted scientific discovery in the future.",

      "abstract": "Making accurate and reliable probability density forecasts of flood processes is fundamentally challenging for machine learning techniques, especially when prediction targets are outside the range of training data. Conceptual hydrological models can reduce rainfall-runoff modelling errors with efficient quasi-physical mechanisms. The Monotone Composite Quantile Regression Neural Network (MCQRNN) is used for the first time to make probability density forecasts of flood processes and serves as a benchmark model, whereas it confronts the drawbacks of overfitting and biased-prediction. Here we propose an integrated model (i.e. XAJ-MCQRNN) that incorporates Xinanjiang conceptual model (XAJ) and MCQRNN to overcome the phenomena of error propagation and accumulation encountered in multi-step-ahead flood probability density forecasts. We consider flood forecasts as a function of rainfall factors and runoff data. The models are evaluated by long-term (2009–2015) 3-hour streamflow series of the Jianxi River catchment in China and rainfall products of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Results demonstrated that the proposed XAJ-MCQRNN model can not only outperform the MCQRNN model but also prominently enhance the accuracy and reliability of multi-step-ahead probability density forecasts of flood process. Regarding short-term forecasts in testing stages at four horizons, the XAJ-MCQRNN model achieved higher Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency but lower Root Mean Square Error values, while improving Coverage Ratio and Relative Bandwidth values in comparison to the MCQRNN model. Consequently, the improvement can benefit the mitigation of the impacts associated with uncertainties of extreme flood and rainfall events as well as promote the accuracy and reliability of flood forecasting and early warning.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 41,
      "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation models can be broadly classified as statistical or physical process based models. However, assuming the limitation of individual approaches, the integration of these two approaches has become a challenging task for ET simulation under varying surface and climatic conditions. To address this issue, a revised Penman-Monteith (PM) formula that uses a non-linear exponential Clausius-Clapeyron relationship was proposed in this study. The improved PM formula was further coupled into the loss function of the deep learning (DL) model, and subsequently, a hybrid DL model was formulated. The hybrid DL model with improved physical conceptualization considered the constraints of surface energy balance and turbulent diffusion processes in the ET simulation. The performance of the hybrid DL model was verified at 212 flux sites from the FLUXNET that contain ten types of underlying surfaces across the globe. The results revealed that as compared to the original DL model, the hybrid DL model improved the predictive capability of ET. The average root-mean-square-error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD) reduced by 12.1 W/m 2 and 5.7%, respectively for latent heat flux (LE) simulation. Furthermore, the hybrid DL model also performed better than the original DL model in predicting the extreme events (such as ET under drought and heatwave conditions) which justifying its improved generalization capability. Sensitivity analysis outcomes showed that the vegetation parameters highest influence for ET simulations at the 212 flux sites, followed by soil parameters and meteorological parameters. The hybrid DL model was further applied to map the inter-seasonal distribution of global ET across twelve months of the year 2015 with five global ET products as the benchmark. Certainly, this research achieved the seamless integration of machine learning-based ET model and physical mechanism-based ET model and provided a new dimension for ET simulation. The hybrid DL model could be adopted to generate continuous ET datasets across regional and global scales.",

      "abstract": "Reliable streamflow prediction is an important productive information in the hydrology and water resources management fields. As used to forecast the nonlinear streamflow time series, the conventional artificial intelligence model may suffer from local convergence defect and fail to track the dynamic changes of the hydrological process when the model parameters and network structure are not well identified. Thus, this research develops a practical hydrological forecasting model based on parallel cooperation search algorithm (PCSA) and extreme learning machine (ELM), where the standard ELM method is chosen as the basic forecasting model, and then the PCSA method using several smaller and independent subswarms for parallel computation is used to determine satisfying input-hidden weights and hidden biases of the ELM model. The proposed model is used to forecast the nonlinear streamflow time series of several real-world hydrological stations in China. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the standard ELM model in various evaluation indicators. Thus, the key contributions of this study lie in two aspects: (1) for the first time, the parallel computing technique is developed to improve the global search ability and resources utilization efficiency of the emerging cooperation search algorithm; (2) an artificial intelligence model coupled with parallel evolutionary optimizer is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy of hydrological time series.",

Here we use a convolutional long short-term memory network, a deep learning approach for learning both spatial and temporal patterns, to predict streamflow at 226 stream gauges across southwestern Canada. The model is forced by gridded climate reanalysis data and trained to predict observed daily streamflow between 1980 and 2015. To interpret the model's learning of both spatial and temporal patterns, we introduce a set of experiments with evaluation metrics to track the model's response to perturbations in the input data. The model performs well in simulating daily streamflow over the testing period, with a median Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.68 and 35 % of stations having . When predicting streamflow, the model is most sensitive to perturbations in the input data prescribed near and within the basins being predicted, demonstrating that the model is automatically learning to focus on physically realistic areas. When uniformly perturbing input temperature time series to obtain relatively warmer and colder input data, the modelled indicator of freshet timing and peak flow changes in accordance with the transition timing from below- to above-freezing temperatures. We also demonstrate that modelled August streamflow in partially glacierized basins is sensitive to perturbations in August temperature, and that this sensitivity increases with glacier cover. The results demonstrate the suitability of a convolutional long short-term memory network architecture for spatiotemporal hydrological modelling, making progress towards interpretable deep learning hydrological models.",

The application of promising machine learning algorithms in this context is not explored much. This study investigates the suitability of two machine learning approaches—random forest regression model (RF) and gradient boosting regression model (GBM) in predicting the hydrological drought indices—standardized streamflow index (SSI) and streamflow drought index (SDI) based on the predicted meteorological drought indices—standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index under the future climate Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. The study predicts long-term hydrological drought indices SSI and SDI from 2006 to 2099 based on global climate models projections. The future drought years were extracted using the run theory. The study reveals that the river basin was prone to hydrological drought occurrences 50–65% of the time during the historic period (1988–2005) and 32–70% during the future period (2006–2099). It is evident from the results that both RF and GBM models follow a similar pattern of dry events in the future, which implies the prediction to be accurate.

The results show that although the LSTM model significantly outperforms the SIMHYD model in the calibration period, it has significant performance degradation in the validation period. Basin characteristics had limited impacts on the performance difference between the LSTM model and the SIMHYD model. The extension of the calibration period improves the performance of the LSTM model, while it has a limited impact on the performance of the SIMHYD model.

The traditional machine learning model lacks transparency and interpretability, which affects the wide application of machine learning in the identification of influencing factors of hydrology. Interpretable machine learning method can improve the interpretability of machine learning model. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is established based on the data generated by the calibrated Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and the XGBoost is interpreted using the Shapely additive explanations (SHAP) method to identify the impact of driving factors on runoff generation. New hydrological insights for the region The results show that XGBoost can simulate the simulation ability of SWAT, and SHAP can identify the factors affecting runoff generation by interpreting XGBoost. It was found that climatic features have different effects on runoff in different sub-basins, and rainfall at high elevations (or slope) has stronger effects on runoff than that at low elevations. There is an obvious threshold effect of land use combination (or slope) on the generation of runoff, and this threshold effect is driven by high precipitation. The results of this study can provide a new method for factor analysis of runoff.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the ability of long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to perform streamflow prediction at ungauged basins. A set of state-of-the-art, hydrological model-dependent regionalization methods are applied to 148 catchments in northeast North America and compared to an LSTM model that uses the exact same available data as the hydrological models. While conceptual model-based methods attempt to derive parameterizations at ungauged sites from other similar or nearby catchments, the LSTM model uses all available data in the region to maximize the information content and increase its robustness. Furthermore, by design, the LSTM does not require explicit definition of hydrological processes and derives its own structure from the provided data. The LSTM networks were able to clearly outperform the hydrological models in a leave-one-out cross-validation regionalization setting on most catchments in the study area, with the LSTM model outperforming the hydrological models in 93 % to 97 % of catchments depending on the hydrological model. Furthermore, for up to 78 % of the catchments, the LSTM model was able to predict streamflow more accurately on pseudo-ungauged catchments than hydrological models calibrated on the target data, showing that the LSTM model's structure was better suited to convert the meteorological data and geophysical descriptors into streamflow than the hydrological models even calibrated to those sites in these cases. Furthermore, the LSTM model robustness was tested by varying its hyperparameters, and still outperformed hydrological models in regionalization in almost all cases. Overall, LSTM networks have the potential to change the regionalization research landscape by providing clear improvement pathways over traditional methods in the field of streamflow prediction in ungauged catchments.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 19,
      "abstract": "Data-driven hydrological modeling has seen rapid development in recent years owing to its flexibility to approximate the complex relationships between driving forces and hydrological fluxes. However, traditional data-driven models typically cannot simultaneously capture the processes that pose both chronic and acute impacts on streamflow, thus impeding further inference. Therefore, this study presents a baseflow-filtered hydrological inference model to gain insights into hydrological processes in irrigated watersheds. The proposed model starts with separating the streamflow process into two sub-processes using a process-based baseflow separation method. Each sub-process is simulated through a new interpretable data-driven model. The resulting hydrological inferences facilitate the identification of the dominant factors influencing flows in saturated and unsaturated zones. The proposed model is applied to three irrigated watersheds, and the evaluation metrics show that the proposed model outperforms two conventional data-driven models. Our findings reveal that predictors associated with air temperature and long-term (i.e., monthly) irrigation are mainly responsible for characterizing baseflow dynamics, while precipitation and short-term (i.e., semi-weekly or weekly) irrigation are primarily responsible for describing overland flow and interflow dynamics. The fidelity of the derived hydrological inference is further demonstrated through sensitivity analysis. The results show that the relative importance of predictors not only reflects their significance on model performance, but also influence the changes on streamflow.",

      "abstract": "Regional Flood Frequency Analysis (RFFA) is one of the widely used approaches for estimating design floods in the ungauged basins. We developed an eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGB) machine learning model for RFFA and flood estimation. Our approach relies on developing a regression model between flood quantiles and the commonly available catchment descriptors. We used CAMELs data for 671 catchments from the USA to test the approach's efficacy. The results were compared with the traditional Multiple Linear Regression methods and Artificial Neural Networks. Results revealed that the XGB-based approach estimated design flood with the highest accuracy during training and validation with minor mean absolute error, root mean square error values, and percentage bias ranging from −10 to + 10. The importance of each catchment feature is visualized by three different approaches Gini Impurity, Permutation, and Dropout Loss Feature Ranking. We observed that the most dominating variables are rainfall intensity, slope, snow fraction, soil porosity, and temperature. It is observed that the importance of these variables is a function of the hydroclimatic regions and varies with space. In contrast, mean annual areal potential evapotranspiration, mean annual rainfall, fraction forest area, and soil conductivity have low significance in estimating design flood for an ungauged catchment. Indeed, the proposed XGB-based approach has broader applicability and replicability.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Research",
      "citations": 65,
      "abstract": "This study examines whether deep learning models can produce reliable future projections of streamflow under warming. We train a regional long short‐term memory network (LSTM) to daily streamflow in 15 watersheds in California and develop three process models (HYMOD, SAC‐SMA, and VIC) as benchmarks. We force all models with scenarios of warming and assess their hydrologic response, including shifts in the hydrograph and total runoff ratio. All process models show a shift to more winter runoff, reduced summer runoff, and a decline in the runoff ratio due to increased evapotranspiration. The LSTM predicts similar hydrograph shifts but in some watersheds predicts an unrealistic increase in the runoff ratio. We then test two alternative versions of the LSTM in which process model outputs are used as either additional training targets (i.e., multi‐output LSTM) or input features. Results indicate that the multi‐output LSTM does not correct the unrealistic streamflow projections under warming. The hybrid LSTM using estimates of evapotranspiration from SAC‐SMA as an additional input feature produces more realistic streamflow projections, but this does not hold for VIC or HYMOD. This suggests that the hybrid method depends on the fidelity of the process model. Finally, we test climate change responses under an LSTM trained to over 500 watersheds across the United States and find more realistic streamflow projections under warming. Ultimately, this work suggests that hybrid modeling may support the use of LSTMs for hydrologic projections under climate change, but so may training LSTMs to a large, diverse set of watersheds.",

      "journal": "Theoretical and Applied Climatology",
      "citations": 4,
      "abstract": "Machine learning for hydrologic modeling has seen significant recent development and has been suggested as a valuable augmentation to physical hydrological modeling, especially in data-scarce catchments. In Pakistan, surface water flows predominantly originate from the transboundary Upper Indus sub-catchments of Chenab, Jhelum, Indus, and Kabul rivers. These catchments have large drainage areas, climate-driven streamflows, high variations in elevation, and limited streamflow gauge coverage. Hence, using machine learning models for data-driven river flow modeling may be well-suited for these catchments. However, hydrologic interpretability of machine learning models is important for the practical use of such models for these catchments. Thus, the current study besides evaluating the potential of three machine learning models (XGBOOST, Classification and Regression Trees(CART), and RandomForest) for streamflow simulation also focused on the hydrologic interpretation of machine learning models using SHapley Additive exPlananations (SHAP). All of these models performed well and the range of and Nasche-Efficiency for all three models lies between 0.61 to 0.90. Moreover, SHAP correctly identified minimum temperature as the most critical feature in glacier-fed Indus and Chenab catchments. It also provides logical insights into interactions between minimum temperature and precipitation for the indus and Chenab catchment. The findings of this study strongly illustrate the usefulness of SHAP analysis in interpreting the behavior of data-scarce high-elevation climate-sensitive catchments using tree-based machine learning models.",

      "abstract": "This study explores strategies for long‐term reservoir simulations by combining generic rule‐based reservoir management model (RMM) and machine learning (ML) models for two major multipurpose reservoirs — Allatoona Lake and Lake Sidney Lanier in the southeastern United States. First, a standalone RMM is developed to simulate daily release and storage during Water Year 1981–2015. Next, using Long‐Short Term Memory (LSTM) as the ML technique, a standalone LSTM model is trained based on reservoir inflow and meteorological observations to simulate reservoir release and estimate reservoir storage through water balance calculation. Three hybrid modeling strategies are developed, one using RMM output as an additional LSTM input (H1), another using LSTM as the initial release estimate in RMM (H2), and the third combining the first two strategies (H3). The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for release (NSE‐r), storage (NSE‐s), and their mean (NSE‐avg) are used for model evaluation. Overall, H1 improves NSE‐r to 0.65 and 0.54 for Allatoona and Lanier, respectively, compared to standalone RMM (0.44 and 0.21); however, its storage trajectory did not produce a physically feasible solution, similar to LSTM. H2 and especially H3 show that they can retain the best features from RMM and LSTM, with H3 NSE‐avg being 0.695 and 0.55 for Allatoona and Lanier outperforming RMM (0.615 and 0.29). The findings suggest a robust simulation capacity for large‐scale water management in future studies.",

      "citations": 7,
      "abstract": "Sedimentation is an important aspect of water resources management with many implications. Often, process‐based methods are employed to predict and assess the amount of sediment in water, but there are still challenges because the mechanisms that govern sediment transport are not yet fully understood. Furthermore, complex domains make model calibration difficult. Thus, as a complementary tool, a machine‐learning model was developed in the present study to emulate an existing process‐based model in simulating suspended sediment concentration (SSC). It employs the long short‐term memory (LSTM) networks, which are a type of artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed for supervised learning of a sequence of data (e.g., time series). The model was applied to the Sacramento‐San Joaquin Delta (the Delta) of California, USA, which is characterized by an interconnected system of sloughs, waterways, and a tidal outlet. The model training was performed with historical records of flow, stage and SSC at various locations within the Delta. The study period was 2010 through 2016, but the training period (i.e., range of observed data used to train the model) was varied to assess the model's sensitivity to the inputs and to determine the optimum model setup. Comparison between the model‐estimated SSC and the observation at 12 key locations within the Delta showed that the estimation accuracy of the LSTM model during the study period is comparable or superior to that of the Delta Simulation Model II‐General Transport Model (DSM2‐GTM), a process‐based operational hydrodynamics and water quality model for the Delta. In terms of the ratio of the root‐mean‐square error to the standard deviation (RSR), LSTM models generally showed higher predictability than DSM2‐GTM in all test cases investigated, with the lowest (most desirable) and highest (least desirable) LSTM‐based RSR being 0.21 and 1.14, respectively. In comparison, the lowest and highest RSR values with DSM2‐GTM were 0.26 and 3.70, respectively. The median LSTM‐based RSR of all study locations is around 0.7 while its DSM2‐GTM counterpart is about 1.0. LSTM models also yielded remarkably higher (more desirable) Nash‐Sutcliffe Efficiency values. Moreover, visual inspection found that LSTM models better captured the timing and magnitude of peaks as well as the temporal variations in the SSC time series. The LSTM model's performance was further analysed with hydro‐meteorological data (precipitation and wind speed) incorporated in training. While precipitation led to some improvement, the wind speed was found to have a negligible effect overall. All in all, the study findings suggest that the LSTM model has the potential to supplement the operational process‐based model in guiding water resources planning and management practices.",

      "abstract": "Daily inflow forecasting is of vital importance in reservoir economic operation. In the context of hydrometeorological forecasting, the effectiveness of the data‐driven models has been demonstrated as bias correctors for physically‐based models or direct forecasting models. However, existing studies only highlight the performance improvements provided by the data‐driven model, lacking a comprehensive investigation on whether the data‐driven model should be used as bias correctors or direct forecasting models. This study constructs long short‐term memory (LSTM)‐based preprocessing and postprocessing techniques for a hydrological model, which are tested by linear scaling preprocessing and autoregressive (AR) postprocessing models. The integrated model is compared with the LSTM‐only model. The Shuibuya and Zuojiang reservoirs in China are selected as case studies. Results indicate that: (1) LSTM‐based bias correctors are effective in both preprocessing and postprocessing and (2) the integrated model is comparable to the LSTM‐only model when trained with four or more years of data, while it is better than the LSTM‐only model when trained with less data. These findings demonstrate that data‐driven methods can effectively correct the bias in physically‐based model output, and integrating the physical and data‐driven models is useful in improving multi‐step ahead reservoir inflow forecasting if limited data can be obtained.",

This paper compares the performances of three machine and deep learning-based rainfall forecasting approaches including a hybrid optimized-by-PSO support vector regression (PSO-SVR), long-short term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural network (CNN). The approaches are used to develop both 5-minute and 15–minute ahead forecast models of rainfall depth based on datasets of Niavaran station, Tehran, Iran. Results of applying the models to all data points indicated that PSO-SVR and LSTM approaches performed almost the same and better than CNN. Subsequently, rainfall events were divided into four classes depending on their severity and duration using K-nearest neighbor method, and a separate forecast model was built for each of the classes. Classification of the events improved the forecast models accuracy where PSO-SVR and LSTM were the best approaches for the 15-minute and 5-minute ahead rainfall forecast models, respectively. Investigating the impact of more predictors on the forecast quality, adding differences of rainfall depths to model predictors improved the accuracy of PSO-SVR approach for the 5-minute ahead forecast model up to 13%. Furthermore, depending on the rainfall event, additional input variables considering rainfall depth fluctuations over shorter time periods than the forecast lead time increased the performances of the PSO-SVR and LSTM approaches between 3–15% and 2–10%, respectively.",

      "title": "Machine learning based streamflow prediction in a hilly catchment for future scenarios using CMIP6 data",
      "journal": "Hydrology and Earth System Sciences",
      "citations": 53,
      "abstract": "The alteration in river flow patterns, particularly those that originate in the Himalaya, has been caused by the increased temperature and rainfall variability brought on by climate change. Due to the impending intensification of extreme climate events, as predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its Sixth Assessment Report, it is more essential than ever to predict changes in streamflow for future periods. Despite the fact that some research has utilised machine-learning- and deep-learning-based models to predict streamflow patterns in response to climate change, very few studies have been undertaken for a mountainous catchment, with the number of studies for the western Himalaya being minimal. This study investigates the capability of five different machine learning (ML) models and one deep learning (DL) model, namely the Gaussian linear regression model (GLM), Gaussian generalised additive model (GAM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARSs), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and 1D convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), in streamflow prediction over the Sutlej River basin in the western Himalaya during the periods 2041-2070 (2050s) and 2071-2100 (2080s). Bias-corrected data downscaled at a grid resolution of 0.25∘ × 0.25∘ from six general circulation models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 GCM framework under two greenhouse gas (GHG) trajectories (SSP245 and SSP585) were used for this purpose. Four different rainfall scenarios (R0, R1, R2, and R3) were applied to the models trained with daily data (1979-2009) at Kasol (the outlet of the basin) in order to better understand how catchment size and the geo-hydromorphological aspects of the basin affect runoff. The predictive power of each model was assessed using six statistical measures, i.e. the coefficient of determination (R2), the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of the measured data (RSR), the mean absolute error (MAE), the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and the percent bias (PBIAS). The RF model with rainfall scenario R3, which outperformed other models during the training (R2 = 0.90; RSR = 0.32; KGE = 0.87; NSE = 0.87; PBIAS = 0.03) and testing (R2 = 0.78; RSR = 0.47; KGE = 0.82; NSE = 0.71; PBIAS = −0.31) period, therefore was chosen to simulate streamflow in the Sutlej River in the 2050s and 2080s under the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios. Bias correction was further applied to the projected daily streamflow in order to generate a reliable times series of the discharge. The mean ensemble of the model results shows that the mean annual streamflow of the Sutlej River is expected to rise between 2050s and 2080s by 0.79 % to 1.43 % for SSP585 and by 0.87 % to 1.10 % for SSP245. In addition, streamflow will increase during the monsoon (9.70 % to 11.41 % and 11.64 % to 12.70 %) in the 2050s and 2080s under both emission scenarios, but it will decrease during the pre-monsoon (−10.36 % to −6.12 % and −10.0 % to −9.13 %), post-monsoon (−1.23 % to −0.22 % and −5.59 % to −2.83 %), and during the winter (−21.87 % to −21.52 % and −21.87 % to −21.11 %). This variability in streamflow is highly correlated with the pattern of precipitation and temperature predicted by CMIP6 GCMs for future emission scenarios and with physical processes operating within the catchment. Predicted declines in the Sutlej River streamflow over the pre-monsoon (April to June) and winter (December to March) seasons might have a significant impact on agriculture downstream of the river, which is already having problems due to water restrictions at this time of year. The present study will therefore assist in strategy planning to ensure the sustainable use of water resources downstream by acquiring knowledge of the nature and causes of unpredictable streamflow patterns.",

      "journal": "International Journal of Climatology",
      "citations": 6,
      "abstract": "Understanding the impact of input variables on black‐box machine learning and deep learning models is necessary. Therefore, this study proposed SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values to address the problem of the interpretability of the output of the support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short‐term memory (LSTM) models to forecast climatic water balance (CWB) within 1–3 months lead‐time. The current study uses two Koppen–Geiger climate zones over Bangladesh: the humid subtropical climate with dry winter and hot summer (Cwa) and the tropical climate (Af‐Am). Monthly antecedent CWB, potential evapotranspiration (PET), convective available potential energy (CAPE), relative humidity (RH), air temperature (TEM), El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) are used as the inputs to the proposed model. SHAP values show that CWB (current month) for both climate zones has the maximum impact on the prediction. The effects of atmospheric variables and ocean–atmospheric teleconnections on CWB forecasts over Bangladesh are low. Forecasting results show that the SVM model shows the best performance for CWB forecasts in the Cwa and Af‐Am climate zones in terms of antecedent CWB as input. And this model effectively decreases the negative effect of increasing forecast lead‐time. Since the proposed model can predict CWB in 3‐months lead‐time, it would help policy‐makers and practitioners to reduce the drought and flood impacts in the future by adopting better preparedness plans.",

      "citations": 37,
      "abstract": "Reliable and accurate flood forecasting is a complex and challenging problem that is essential for the creation of disaster preparedness plans to protect life and reduce economic losses. This study suggests a novel hybrid model for real-time multi-steps-ahead flood forecasting within the Saint-Lawrence River in Quebec by integrating the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and improved outlier-robust extreme learning machine (IORELM) models. The DWTIORELM model was constructed with three main novelties: (i) Consider the sparsity characteristics of the outliers to enhance the performance of the ELM-based model in the presence of outliers, (ii) Introduce an iterative process to overcome the random definition of the two main matrices in the ELM-based approaches, (iii) Integrate IORELM with DWT as a preprocessing technique to decompose the main input signals to high-scale and low-frequency signals. The performance of the individual IORELM is compared with the original version of ELM, Regularized ELM (RELM), and Weighted RELM (WRELM) in terms of global accuracy and accuracy in peak flow forecasting. The results indicated that the IORELM outperformed other models. However, there was a need for a model that could perform better for peak flow detection. IORELM, as the best individual model, was integrated with DWT, and the DWTIORELM model was developed to overcome this limitation. In addition, the comparison results of the hybrid DWTIORELM and individual IORELM models in terms of accuracy and simplicity as well as peak flow forecasting indicate that the introduced hybrid model ( R = 0.99, NSE = 0.99; RMSE = 0.234; NRMSE = 0.021; MARE = 0.02) in the current study not only overcomes all limitations of the existing ELM-based methods but also could be applied in multi-steps-ahead flood forecasting. The optimum values of the number of hidden neurons, decomposition level, and iteration number were found to be 200, 1, and 500, respectively. Furthermore, the Sigmoid function and Discrete Meyer (DM) were selected as the best activation function and mother wavelet, respectively. The developed hybrid model was applied to check its performance in multi-steps-ahead flood forecasting for one to nine hours ahead. The results showed that it could forecast peak flows with an average relative error of less than 5 %.",

      "abstract": "The highly non-linear and nonstationary nature of runoff events in changing environments makes accurate and reliable runoff forecasting difficult. We propose a hybrid model by integrating an autoregressive (AR) model, Bayesian inference, a complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) algorithm, Bayesian optimization, and support vector regression. Two Bayesian inference methods (the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) and variational inference) were used to calculate the parameters of the AR model to obtain a Bayesian AR (BAR) model. Credible intervals were used to analyse the uncertainty of the parameters and model prediction results. The above model is applied to the daily runoff predictions of hydrological stations in the Yellow River basin of China. The results show that (1) the hybrid model can improve the prediction accuracy and (2) the NUTS algorithm-based model provides a narrower reliable interval and performs better in uncertainty analyses.",

      "abstract": "Soil water and heat transport are two physical processes that are described by the Richardson–Richards equation and heat transport equation, respectively. Soil water and heat motion directly control transport or indirectly influence parameters. The physics‐informed neural network (PINN) is a new method that combines deep learning and physical laws that approximates and learns physical dynamics better than traditional data‐driven deep learning methods. In this study, we propose multiphysics‐informed neural networks for soil water‐heat systems, in which the soil moisture and temperature information complement each other well. With our framework, existing soil moisture neural networks are improved to reduce their dependency on the soil moisture measurement density. Furthermore, soil moisture data are employed to promote soil temperature dynamic learning and soil thermal conductivity estimation. Moreover, soil temperature data assist in recovering the nonlinearity of the soil hydraulic conductivity through hydrothermal coupling constraints, allowing better estimations of the soil water flux density. The gradient‐based annealing method is applied to adapt the loss function, which satisfactorily balances the water‐heat transport governing equation constraints on the neural networks. The robustness and generalizability of our framework are examined under diverse scenarios. This work demonstrates the mutual compensation of multisource data in coupled physical processes in a deep learning framework and highlights the significance of appropriate multiphysical constraints designed for nonlinear parameter recovery in PINNs.",

We created various data‐driven models (DDMs) based on machine learning: long short‐term memory (LSTM), support vector regression (SVR), extreme learning machines, and an artificial neural network with backpropagation, to define the optimal approach to predicting streamflow time series in the Carson River (California, USA) and Montmorency (Canada) catchments. The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow‐coverage dataset was applied to improve the streamflow estimate. In addition to the DDMs, the conceptual snowmelt runoff model was applied to simulate and forecast daily streamflow. The four main predictor variables, namely snow‐coverage (S‐C), precipitation ( P ), maximum temperature ( T max ), and minimum temperature ( T min ), and their corresponding values for each river basin, were obtained from National Climatic Data Center and National Snow and Ice Data Center to develop the model. The most relevant predictor variable was chosen using the support vector machine‐recursive feature elimination feature selection approach. The results show that incorporating the MODIS snow‐coverage dataset improves the models' prediction accuracies in the snowmelt‐dominated basin. SVR and LSTM exhibited the best performances (root mean square error = 8.63 and 9.80) using monthly and daily snowmelt time series, respectively. In summary, machine learning is a reliable method to forecast runoff as it can be employed in global climate forecasts that require high‐volume data processing.",

      "abstract": "Rainfall-runoff modeling is a complex nonlinear spatiotemporal prediction problem. However, few studies have considered the spatial characteristics of rainfall-runoff relationship in runoff forecasts based on machine learning. With the emergence of high-resolution Satellite-based Precipitation Products (SPPs) and the continuous improvement of rainfall estimation accuracy, the shortcoming of sparse spatial information for in-situ rainfall monitoring has been made up. Therefore, this study developed a large scale spatiotemporal deep learning rainfall-runoff (SDLRR) forecasting model for hydrological stations in the upper Yangtze River, and evaluated the positive impact of utilizing spatial information of three SPPs on reducing errors of runoff forecasts. The adopted remote sensing precipitation products are bias-corrected Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement data (IMERG) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis data (TMPA). For runoff forecasting at the Luoduxi (LDX) hydrological station, compared to regular Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) model, the proposed SDLRR model that utilizing IMERG data as precipitation input (IMERG_SDLRR) improved 15% in terms of Coefficient of Determination (R 2 ) and improved 25% in terms of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Compared to the best performance model among models using area-averaged precipitation as input, IMERG_SDLRR improved 5% in terms of R 2 and 11% in terms of RMSE. Good performance was also acquired in the other hydrological stations. For extreme flood forecasts, IMERG_SDLRR decreased Mean Relative Error (MRE) by 0.29 and increased Qualified Rate (QR) by 53% compared to LSTM, and decreased MRE by 0.08 and increased QR by 6% compared to the best performance model using area-averaged precipitation as input. The utilization of IMERG or TMPA spatial information improved the accuracy of runoff forecasting. The accuracy evaluation of SPPs based on the results of spatiotemporal rainfall-runoff forecasts method was also demonstrated. The research is of great significance for developing runoff forecasting methods and optimizing water resources management.",

To that end, we integrated and employed the Shapely Additive explanations (SHAP), Sobol-based sensitivity analysis, and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to evaluate the interpretability of the models in predicting daily pan evaporation, at Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah (SMBA) weather station, in Morocco. The validation results of the models showed that the developed models are accurate in reproducing the daily pan evaporation with NSE ranging from 0.76 to 0.83 during the validation phase. Furthermore, the interpretability results of the ML models showed that the air temperature (Ta), solar radiation (Rs), followed by relative humidity (H) are the most important climate variables with inflection points of the Ta_median, Ta_mean, Rs_sum, H_mean, and w_std are 17.42 °C, 17.65 °C, 3.8 kw.m −2 , 69.59%, and 1.25 m s −1 , sequentially. Overall, the interpretability of the models showed a good consistency of the ML models with the real hydro-climatic process of evaporation in a semi-arid environment. Hence, the proposed methodology is powerful in enhancing the reliability and transparency of the developed models for predicting daily pan evaporation. Finally, the proposed approach is new insights to reduce the ‘‘Black-Box’’ character of ML models in hydrological studies.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 35,
      "abstract": "Deep neural network (DNN) models have become increasingly popular in the hydrology community. However, most studies are related to (rainfall-) runoff simulation and comparatively fewer studies have focused on runoff forecasting. In this study, quantile-based (q= 0.05, 0.5, 0.95) encoder-decoder (ED) models that use long short-term memory network (LSTM) and dense network (DN) blocks were developed for three and five days ahead runoff forecasting. Through linear (LW) and non-linear (NLW) wavelet selection, hybrid models LSTM-DN, LSTM-DN-LW, LSTM-DN-NLW, ED, ED-LW, and ED-NLW were developed. For each lead time (LT= 3, 5) and value of q, different model configurations were created using different input lag lengths (IL= 15, 45, 180). The developed models were tested for runoff forecasting using three basins (with different characteristics) from the Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) dataset. The models were compared using deterministic (eg, the Kling-Gupta efficiency [KGE] metric) and probabilistic (eg, reliability) statistical metrics. While the models showed high variability in performance across the three basins (KGE= 0.308–0.979 for the q= 0.5 models), very high accuracy (up to KGE= 0.979) was achieved for one of the basins with high snowmelt. The ED-NLW model was found to generally outperform the other models. Although the LSTM-DN model had the highest median KGE (0.434 across all configurations), the ED and ED-NLW models had higher reliability than LSTM-DN (90% and 91%, respectively, considering a 90% confidence level). Models coupled with NLW performed superior to those that used LW. All ED models had high reliability despite two of the basins achieving median KGE values of∼ 0.390, highlighting that quantile-based models can generate reliable forecast intervals even when the KGE of the median forecast (q= 0.5) is low. An additional experiment generated synthetic precipitation forecasts with varying degrees of accuracy. The models were trained using accurate precipitation forecasts and tested using both accurate and inaccurate precipitation forecasts. While up to a 120% improvement in KGE was found when accurate precipitation forecasts were used as input to the models, using inaccurate precipitation forecasts resulted in a substantial decrease in reliability. Overall, the results of this study can serve as a benchmark for future studies developing probabilistic DNN models for runoff forecasting.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 71,
      "abstract": "There exists a substantial disparity in the distribution of streamflow gauge and basin characteristic information, with a majority of flood observations being recorded from a limited number of well-monitored locations. Transferring hydrological knowledge from data-rich to data-sparse basins has been a persistent issue. While artificial intelligence methods, such as Long-Short-Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTMs) have been attempted for simulating across different basins, the problem of gradient vanishing still inevitably lead to difficulties in responding to new basin datasets. A novel solution is presented in the form of the Transfer Learning Framework based on Transformer (TL-Transformer), which can accurately predict flooding in data-sparse basins (targets) by using models from data-rich basins (sources) without requiring extensive basin attributes at the target location. The framework was demonstrated in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, and performance was evaluated using the Nash Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, root mean square error, and bias. The results show that TL-Transformer outperforms other models, including TOPMODEL, MLP, TL-MLP, LSTM, TL-LSTM and Transformer in all target basin stations. Compared with those models that without transfer learning, TL-Transformer showed significantly improved performance, where NSE increased by 0.2 and reached above 0.75, RMSE and bias were also controlled within 60 and 20, respectively. Furthermore, pre-training on basins with hydrological similarities increases the benefits of Transfer Learning, and we explained this response phenomenon through the topographic index. These results suggest that deep learning can tap into the commonalities in hydrological data across basins to improve the accuracy of flood forecast applications in areas with limited observations.",

      "abstract": "The East African region is highly susceptible to severe floods and persistent droughts, which greatly impact the livelihood of millions of people. Early warnings, at least a few seasons in advance, would help implement mitigation measures. However, most prediction systems using dynamical models perform poorly at long lead times. In this study, we propose a statistical deep learning approach based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict extreme floods and droughts during the short rains season (October–December). The proposed CNN model captures the phase of extreme floods and droughts two to three seasons ahead, except for a few cases. By diagnosing the model’s skills using heatmaps, we find that predicted extreme floods and droughts are linked with the sea surface temperature anomalies of the Indian Ocean Dipole at shorter leads and with western and southern Indian Ocean, equatorial Pacific, and southern Atlantic Ocean at longer leads. Although there were a few poorly predicted exceptions, the superior skill of our CNN-based predictions at longer leads provides a significant advantage in developing mitigation measures.",

      "citations": 6,
      "abstract": "Subseasonal to seasonal (S2s) precipitation forecasts provide great potential for hydrological forecasting at an extended range. The study proposed a support vector machine (SVM) regression‐based method to improve S2s precipitation forecasts from the European Center for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) across the globe (60°N to 60°S). Results suggested that the SVM‐based method significantly improved ECMWF daily precipitation forecasts in representing the spatiotemporal variation of precipitation with higher consistency and reduced errors when compared against observations. Furthermore, the SVM‐based method enhanced the probabilistic skill of ECMWF forecasts, providing improved ranked probability skill score (RPSS) for real‐time forecasts in 2020 (e.g., RPSS ECMWF = −0.03 and RPSS rg3 = 0.08 for lead week 1). The most substantial improvement from the SVM‐based method is witnessed in regions with complex terrains where ECMWF yielded the worst skill, such as the Andes mountain range, Congo River Basin, and the Tibet Plateau. However, the SVM‐based post‐processing method did not alter the characteristics of precipitation forecasts regarding climate zone and lead time. Both ECMWF and post‐processed forecasts showed higher skill in the temperate and continental climate zones when the lead time is shorter than 2 weeks. In comparison, low‐latitude regions exhibited higher predictability when the lead time is longer than 5 weeks, which is attributed to the slow variation of boundary conditions such as the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO).",

      "journal": "Water Resources Research",
      "citations": 32,
      "abstract": "Accurate runoff forecasting plays a vital role in issuing timely flood warnings. Whereas, previous research has primarily focused on historical runoff and precipitation variability while disregarding other factors' influence. Additionally, the prediction process of most machine learning models is opaque, resulting in low interpretability of model predictions. Hence, this study develops an ensemble deep learning model to forecast runoff from three hydrological stations. Initially, time‐varying filtered based empirical mode decomposition is employed to decompose the runoff series into several internal mode functions (IMFs). Subsequently, the complexity of each IMF component is evaluated by the multi‐scale permutation entropy, and the IMFs are classified into high‐ and low‐frequency portions based on entropy values. Considering the high‐frequency portions still exhibit great volatility, robust local mean decomposition is adopted to perform secondary decomposition of the high‐frequency portions. Then, the meteorological variables processed by the Relief algorithm and variance inflation factor features are employed as inputs, the individual subsequences of secondary and preliminary decomposition as outputs to the bidirectional gated recurrent unit and extreme learning machine models. Random forests (RF) are introduced to nonlinear ensemble the individual predicted sub‐models to obtain the final prediction results. The proposed model outperforms other models in various evaluation metrics. Meanwhile, due to the opaque nature of machine learning models, shapley is employed to assess the contribution of each selected meteorological variable to the long‐term trend of runoff. The proposed model could serve as an essential reference for precise flood prediction and timely warning.",

      "journal": "Advances in Water Resources",
      "citations": 12,
      "abstract": "Hydrologists have been actively exploring the utility of machine learning (ML) models for predicting streamflow. While ML methods have proven to be as accurate as conventional modeling techniques for streamflows well represented in the training set, they continue to lack satisfactory skills for extreme events. In this study, a novel ‘data reformation’ technique is proposed based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) – a measure of speed and direction of changes in the time series. RSI homogenizes all observations to a constrained 0–100 range, and all ‘out-of-sample’ data in the testing set fall within the space of the training set. Long Short-Term Memory network with an attention mechanism is used to train three ML models using 55,055 events from the CAMELS dataset (670 basins, 1980–2014). Predictions are made for 12,424 events, of which 3,810 are significantly higher than streamflows in the training set. The ML model based on RSI-reformed data exhibits superior performance, as compared to other advanced ML models without data reformation. Peaks up to 15 times larger than those in the training events are accurately predicted, leading to an outperforming model skill for 433 out of 670 catchments. These findings indicate that incorporating a new data reformation technique into the data pre-processing step in ML modeling can enhance the utility of ML models for extreme events. This research encourages further exploration to identify better data reformation methods to enable confident ML predictions.",

      "citations": 5,
      "abstract": "This study introduces a framework that strategically applies a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based approach for monthly runoff prediction in South Africa and Central Asia. The framework is distinct in its utilization of newly developed Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)-derived climate dynamics variables and Global Streamflow Indices and Metadata Archives (GSIM)-derived static descriptors, ensuring a consistent evaluation of Deep Learning (DL) performance across multiple continents, including North and South America, and Western Europe. Seven LSTM models were trained using seven different datasets, each representing a combination of these data-rich regions. We assessed the sensitivity of these seven training data sets to LSTM models by testing these trained models in predicting monthly basin-scale runoff across 214 test catchments located in South Africa and Central Asia. Our results show that runoff predictions generated by LSTM within the test domain could exhibit better prediction skills compared to those derived from GLDAS datasets. The performance of the trained LSTMs appears to be linked to hydrological similarities between the data-rich regions and the test basins. Also, our results indicate the importance of selecting the appropriate input sources for the LSTM models to achieve accurate runoff predictions at the test region. We emphasize the possibility of utilizing LSTM models that are leveraging on either North American catchments or a combination of South American and Western European catchments to predict basin-scale runoff in the test regions. To this end, this study harnesses the burgeoning availability of publicly stream-gauge datasets and DL to enhance water information prediction in ungauged regions, responding to the challenge of geographically unbalanced stream gauge instruments.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 11,
      "abstract": "Constrained by the sparsity of observational streamflow data, large-scale catchments face pressing challenges in streamflow prediction and flood management amid climate change. Deep learning excels in simulation performance while flow lag information in data-driven approaches is barely highlighted. In this study, we introduce a time-lag informed deep learning framework for large-scale catchments. Central to this framework is the utilization of flow time-lag information between upstream and downstream subbasins, enabling precise flood forecasting at outlet driven by upstream data. Taking the monsoon-influenced large-scale Dulong-Irrawaddy River Basin (DIRB) as study area, we determined peak flow lag (PFL) days and relative annual flow scale (RAFS) for defined subbasins. By incorporating this time-lag information with historical flow data at different time intervals, we developed the optimal model for DIRB. This model was then applied to evaluate the flood processes in 2008 and 2009, using selected flood indicators. The results indicate that the time-lag information led to significant performance improvements, notably in the LSTM_PFL_RAFS model driven by upstream Hkamti sub-basin data, which achieved a Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) of 0.891 (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, NSE, 0.904), surpassing LSTM's 0.683 (NSE, 0.785). Further integration of historical flow data with specific interval, the optimal model, H(15)_PFL utilizes Hkamti sub-basin data, reached an impressive KGE of 0.948 (NSE, 0.940). This model outperformed standard LSTM in accurately simulating key flood characteristics, including peak flows, initiation times, and durations for the 2008 and 2009 flood events. Notably, H(15)_PFL provides a valuable 15-day lead time for flood forecasting, extending the window for emergency response preparations. Future research that incorporates additional essential catchment features into the framework holds great potential in unraveling the complex mechanisms of hydrological responses to human activities and climate change.",

      "journal": "Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres",
      "citations": 4,
      "abstract": "We introduce the idea of simultaneous heavy precipitation events (SHPEs) to understand whether extreme precipitation has a spatial organization manifested as specified tracks or contiguous fields with inherent scaling relationships. For this purpose, we created a database of SHPEs using ground‐based precipitation observations recorded by the daily Global Historical Climatology Network across the conterminous United States during 1900–2014. SHPEs are examined for their seasonality, spatial manifestation, orientation, and areal extent. We quantified the spatial distribution of the centroids and principal axes of SHPEs and their quasi‐elliptical manifestations, azimuthal orientations, and areal extents on the ground. Four seasons, December‐January‐February (DJF), March‐April‐May (MAM), June‐July‐August (JJA), and September‐October‐November (SON) are considered to examine the spatial patterns and associated large‐scale atmospheric circulations. Results indicate that there are 54, 58, 103, and 204 SHPEs in DJF, MAM, JJA, and SON seasons, and their longest stretches range on average between 650 and 1,600, between 850 and 1,500, between 950 and 1,550, and between 750 and 1,450 km, respectively. SHPEs in the DJF, MAM, and JJA seasons occur mostly over the Pacific coast and central and midwestern United States, respectively. The atmospheric circulation patterns and mechanisms of precipitable water vapor and moisture transport in the atmosphere are also discussed in relation to these SHPEs. Power laws explain SHPEs' underlying area scaling behavior in all the four seasons, with stronger evidence in DJF and MAM. A seasonal spatial risk model is developed to predict the likelihood of SHPEs. Quantifying the characteristics of SHPEs and modeling their footprints can improve the projections of flood risk and understanding of damages to interconnected infrastructure systems.",

      "citations": 63,
      "abstract": "Changes in the hydrologic cycle have far reaching impacts on agricultural productivity, water resources availability, riverine ecosystems, and our ability to manage environmental assets, bushfire risk, and flood hazard. For example, declining rainfall in the southeast of Australia has led to a prolonged period of drought, with serious impacts on agriculture, the environment, and water supply to urban and rural towns. Here, using the continental wide Australian Water Resources Assessment Landscape model (AWRA-L), we evaluate historical trends from 1960 to 2017 in rainfall, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and runoff to explain changing drought and flooding. Northern parts of Australia have experienced increasing annual rainfall totals, resulting in increased water availability in the tropics with increased soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and runoff, particularly during the hot, wet monsoon season. In contrast, the southwest and southeast coast of Australia have experienced declines in rainfall, particularly in the colder months, corresponding with decreasing evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and runoff. Trends in flooding are aligned with runoff trends, and closely follow trends in rainfall, with changes in soil moisture of secondary influence. Streamflow droughts, measured by the standardised runoff index, are increasing across large parts of Australia, with these increases more widespread than changes in rainfall alone. Increases in rainfall in the tropics of northern Australia appear to be related to decreasing drought occurrence and extent, but this trend is not universal, suggesting changes in rainfall alone are not an indicator of changing drought conditions.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 74,
      "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the most important variables in terrestrial ecosystems, linking the carbon-water-energy cycles. In this study, we first analyze the spatial patterns of annual ET changes during 1980–2010 across China using four ET products: (i) the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model version 3.0a (GLEAMv3.0), (ii) the EartH2Observe ensemble (EartH2Observe-En), (iii) the Global Land Data Assimilation System version 2.0 with Noah model (GLDAS2.0-Noah), and (iv) the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Application-Land (MERRA-Land). The results show that the spatial distribution of annual mean ET values and long-term changes derived from these four ET products are similar. Overall, large-scale increases in ET are observed in southeastern China, while decreases in ET over the northeast. Furthermore, we apply a newly developed separation method with the Budyko framework to quantify the individual contribution of five climatic factors to ET changes, including precipitation (P), net radiation (R n ), air temperature (T), vapour pressure deficit (VPD), and wind speed (u). It is found that the dynamics of P, R n , and VPD are all strongly correlated with ET, suggesting that they are the major climatic factors influencing ET changes. Specifically, precipitation is the dominant factor for ET in water-limited regions, while ET changes in energy-limited regions are dominated by VPD according to all ET products except the EartH2Observe-En in which R n and VPD have comparable performance. Our study highlights the importance of VPD in ET changes across energy-limited regions of China and suggests that the role of VPD in land surface-atmosphere interactions should be considered in future studies.",

      "journal": "Atmospheric Research",
      "citations": 34,
      "abstract": "Previous studies revealed that many areas in Africa experienced an apparent warming rate in surface temperature in the last century. However, the contributing factors have not been investigated in details. In the present study, natural and anthropogenic forcings accountable for surface temperature variability and change are examined from the historical Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase six (CMIP6) simulations and future projections under three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2.4.5 and SSP5-8.5), which represent low, moderate and high emission scenarios, respectively. Results indicate that from 1901 to 2014, surface temperature has increased by ~0.07 °C/decade over both Eastern Africa (EAF) and Sahara (SAH) regions, 0.06 °C/decade in Southern Africa (SAF) and Western Africa (WAF) regions and follows the global warming trend. It is found that Greenhouse Gases (GHG) and Land-Use (LU) change are the leading contributors to the observed warming in historical surface temperature over Africa. Anthropogenic Aerosols (AA) show a cooling effect on surface temperature. Under both SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5 emission scenarios, the surface temperature increases to 2059 and declines afterwards. On the other hand, under SSP5-8.5, the surface temperature is expected to increase throughout the 21 st century. The impacts of warming will be hard-felt in SAH and SAF regions compared to other areas. The analysis of rare hot and cold events (2080–2099) based on the 20-year annual highest and lowest daily surface temperature relative to the recent past (1995 – 2014) under SSP2-4.5 indicates that both events are likely to increase significantly in the later 21 st century. Nevertheless, proper management of Land use and control of anthropogenic factors (GHGs and AA) may lead to a substantial reduction in further warming over Africa.",

      "abstract": "Atmospheric reanalyses are a valuable climate-related resource where in situ data are sparse. However, few studies have investigated the skill of reanalyses to represent extreme climate indices over the North American Arctic, where changes have been rapid and indigenous responses to change are critical. This study investigates temperature and precipitation extremes as defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) over a 17-yr period (2000–16) for regional and global reanalyses, namely the Arctic System Reanalysis, version 2 (ASRv2); North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR); European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis; Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2); and Global Meteorological Forcing Dataset for Land Surface Modeling (GMFD). Results indicate that the best performances are demonstrated by ASRv2 and ERA5. Relative to observations, reanalyses show the weakest performance over far northern basins (e.g., the Arctic and Hudson basins) where observing networks are less dense. Observations and reanalyses show consistent warming with decreased frequency and intensity of cold extremes. Cold days, cold nights, frost days, and ice days have decreased dramatically over the last two decades. Warming can be linked to a simultaneous increase in daily precipitation intensity over several basins in the domain. Moreover, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Arctic Oscillation (AO) distinctly influence extreme climate indices. Thus, these findings detail the complexity of how the climate of the Arctic is changing, not just in an average sense, but in extreme events that have significant impacts on people and places.",

Results indicate that all three types of hot extremes become more frequent, and CHEs are projected to be the dominant type at the end of this century under the representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario. Furthermore, compared to the rural land, the urban land experiences even stronger increases in CHEs in terms of frequency, duration, and intensity. These faster increases of CHEs in urban areas highlight the urgency of developing and implementing mitigation and adaptation strategies to combat the adverse health effects of global warming and urban heat islands.",

      "abstract": "This research investigates spatiotemporal variations in ETo and the controlling factor of those variations using the modified Mann-Kendall test, empirical Bayesian kriging model, Morlet wavelet analysis (MWA), and cross-wavelet transform (XWT) model relying on daily climate data sets obtained from 18 meteorological stations for the period 1980–2017. Additionally, the stepwise linear regression analysis and partial correlation coefficient (PCC) were employed to determine the variables driving the changes in ETo. The investigation exhibited a decline in annual for −1.19 mm year −1 and seasonal (−0.40 mm decade −1 during pre-monsoon, −0.47 mm decade −1 during post-monsoon, −0.50 mm decade −1 during winter) ETo, which indicates the existence of “evapotranspiration paradox” in Bangladesh, similar to many regions across the globe. The trend test depicted that despite the increase in mean temperature (MT), a noteworthy decrease in sunshine duration (SD), and wind speed (WS) are the main reasons for the reduction in ETo. Spatial analysis of ETo revealed the highest annual values in the southwest while the lowest in the northwest. Two cycles, 1–3 and 3–5 years were found significant in the annual and seasonal ETo. The outcomes revealed coherence among ETo with meteorological factors at different time-frequency bands, which is noteworthy. Stepwise regression and PCC showed that the impact of meteorological factors on ETo varies on the annual and seasonal scales where MT, RH, and SD are the major factors responsible for the variations of ETo in both annual and seasonal scales. These outcomes of the research can be advantageous for designing irrigation and management of sustainable water resources to mitigate climate change impacts as well as controlling anthropogenic activities.",

      "journal": "Hydrology and Earth System Sciences",
      "citations": 67,
      "abstract": "Water recycled through transpiring forests influences the spatial distribution of precipitation in the Amazon and has been shown to play a role in the initiation of the wet season. However, due to the challenges and costs associated with measuring evapotranspiration (ET) directly and high uncertainty in remote-sensing ET retrievals, the spatial and temporal patterns in Amazon ET remain poorly understood. In this study, we estimated ET over the Amazon and 10 sub-basins using a catchment-balance approach, whereby ET is calculated directly as the balance between precipitation, runoff, and change in groundwater storage. We compared our results with ET from remote-sensing datasets, reanalysis, models from Phase 5 and Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIP5 and CMIP6 respectively), and in situ flux tower measurements to provide a comprehensive overview of current understanding. Catchment-balance analysis revealed a gradient in ET from east to west/southwest across the Amazon Basin, a strong seasonal cycle in basin-mean ET primarily controlled by net incoming radiation, and no trend in ET over the past 2 decades. This approach has a degree of uncertainty, due to errors in each of the terms of the water budget; therefore, we conducted an error analysis to identify the range of likely values. Satellite datasets, reanalysis, and climate models all tended to overestimate the magnitude of ET relative to catchment-balance estimates, underestimate seasonal and interannual variability, and show conflicting positive and negative trends. Only two out of six satellite and model datasets analysed reproduced spatial and seasonal variation in Amazon ET, and captured the same controls on ET as indicated by catchment-balance analysis. CMIP5 and CMIP6 ET was inconsistent with catchment-balance estimates over all scales analysed.

      "abstract": "Flooding is a significant threat to life and property in Hawaiʻi. As climate warming continues to alter precipitation patterns and hydrological processes in the tropics, characterizing the shifting patterns in magnitude, seasonality, and location of floods would improve our understanding of the consequences and better prepare us for future flood events. In this study, 84 rain gauges and 111 crest gauges across five major Hawaiian Islands were analyzed from 1970 to 2005. We estimated trends in the annual maximum daily rainfall (RF max ) and the annual peak flow (PF max ) using the Mann-Kendall test and Senʻs slope. Subsequently, we examined the association between PF max and rainfall. Then, we assessed temporal shifting by combining circular analysis with Senʻs slope. The main identified trends showed decreases in RF max and PF max (67% and 61% of all gauges, respectively). The physiography of the Hawaiian islands (i.e., windward vs. leeward) has little contribution to both trends. In addition, PF max trend cannot be fully attributed to RF max trend, and in many cases, RF max and PF max did not occur coincidently. We also found the timing of RF max and PF max occurred in early wet season during the El Niño years and shifted even earlier from 1970 to 2005, likely due to the change of El Niño. These findings have implications for assessing flood risk. Our finding will aid watershed management and flood mitigation, and can increase resilience of downstream communities and near-shore environments.",

      "citations": 13,
      "abstract": "Due to the devastating impact of compound dry and hot events (CDHEs), reliable early warming information is particularly important for reducing their potential damages. Previous studies on the evaluation and prediction of CDHEs are commonly conducted by defining the compound event as a binary variable (i.e., occurrence or not), which is simple to use but lacks information on the severity level of these events. The prediction of multiple categories (or different severity classes or levels) of CDHEs, which could be useful for operational decision-making, is still lacking. This study employs the ordinal regression model to predict different categories of CDHEs during July-August in northeast China (NEC) based on preceding El Niño-Southern Oscillation (or ENSO) for the period from 1952 to 2012. Correlation analysis and composite analysis show that preceding La Niña is closely related to CDHEs over northeast China and can be used to predict CDHEs several months in advance. The performance of the probabilistic prediction of CDHEs for 1-month to 6-month lead time is assessed using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Results show that the proposed method outperforms the reference prediction (i.e., climatology) for predicting different categories of CDHEs of August in northeast China (with limited prediction skills in July). The CDHE during 1975 is used as a case study to demonstrate the application of the proposed model for categorical prediction. This study could be useful to provide early warning information of CDHEs for decision-making to mitigate their negative impacts.",

In this study, the relationship between mean temperature (MT) and extreme precipitation and the influence from large-scale circulation were investigated in Hunan Province. The correlation between MT and the frequency of extreme precipitation events in different seasons (spring, summer, and autumn) and time periods (1960–2009) was used to obtain pairs of spatial patterns by the singular value decomposition method. The temporal expansion series displayed a consistent trend of temperature and extreme precipitation, and a mutation was observed to occur approximately during the 1980s–1990s. Temperature exhibited a warming trend after the mutation, but the frequency of extreme precipitation events exhibited obvious spatio-temporal variations. The causes of seasonal differences in the frequency of extreme precipitation events were determined by comparing interdecadal changes in three atmospheric circulation factors (850 hPa winds, the entire layer of vapor transportation fluxes and vapor flux divergence) before and after the mutation was revealed.",

      "abstract": "The frequency of extreme precipitation is increasing globally and poses a significant threat to human and natural systems. At the regional scale, these changes are becoming increasingly uncertain. Therefore, it is critical to understand the spatiotemporal evolution of extreme precipitation on a regional scale. In this study, we applied the connected component labelling algorithm to define regional extreme precipitation events (REPEs). This approach considers spatial coverage and its correlation with precipitation. We further investigated the spatiotemporal changes in extreme precipitation in the Yangtze River basin using the empirical orthogonal function and examined their potential relationships with large-scale climate indices, including the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The results show that REPEs in the study area exhibited an increasing trend in both frequency and spatial coverage since 1970. In addition, the integrated effects of PDO and ENSO have a significant impact on REPEs at various scales in summer and at large scales in winter. We also analysed the differences in these events between the current year and the following year for PDO and ENSO combinations and found that the position of REPEs change with different PDO and ENSO combinations in both summer and winter season. The spatiotemporal characteristics of REPEs in the study area reveal the corresponding connections with the East Asian continent–ocean 500-hPa pressure field. Based on our analysis and current predictions of these ocean–atmospheric oscillations, we suggest creating more REPE scenarios for upcoming decades, which may benefit forecasting and water resource management.",

A national study was conducted to assess the relationship between surface flow, climate and intrinsic catchment attributes in Australia. Subcatchments were delineated based on Horton's 5th stream order and were characterised by identifying parameters that influence streamflow and flood behaviour. Because observational datasets like rainfall and streamflow commonly have a non-normal distribution, the method of L -moments was applied to several time series. Surface hydrology and baseflow patterns were represented by twenty indices, which were statistically summarised via principal component (PC) analysis, yielding six PCs. Forty catchment descriptors from the themes of climate, topography, surface condition and hydrogeology were used to investigate their link with runoff patterns. Among these is the land surface value, a newly defined index incorporating soil properties and land use to estimate the capacity for water infiltration. All metrics were explored via correlation and regression analysis against the surface hydrology PCs and their influence on runoff discussed. The predictive skill of the regression models is improved when non-perennial waterways are excluded. Although rainfall characteristics dominate streamflow behaviour, topographical and surface conditions also greatly impact on runoff, especially during low-flow periods.",

      "citations": 34,
      "abstract": "Changes in precipitation seasonality or the distribution of precipitation have important impacts on hydrological extremes (e.g., floods or droughts). Precipitation extremes have been widely reported to increase with global warming; however, the variability and mechanism of precipitation seasonality have not been well quantified in China. Here, we explore the multiscale variability in precipitation seasonality from 1960 to 2018 in China. A seasonality index of precipitation is defined to quantify the precipitation seasonality with a lower value indicating a more even distribution throughout a year. The seasonality index increases from southeastern to northwestern China, with a decrease in the annual mean precipitation, a later timing of the wet season, and a shorter wet season duration. The seasonality index decreases from 1960 to 2018 in China, accompanied by the increasing duration of wet season, especially in northern climate-sensitive basins, such as the Northwest River, Hai River, and Songliao River basins. In the Northwest River basin, for example, the observed significant decrease in the seasonality index (~0.02 decade −1 ) from 1960 to 2018 is consistent with a significant decrease in the ratio of annual maximum 10-day precipitation to annual precipitation, which is confirmed by their significant positive correlation ( R = 0.72; p = 0). El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dominates interannual fluctuations and spatial patterns of precipitation seasonality in China. In El Niño years, the precipitation seasonality index decreases across China except for the Yangtze River basin, with broad increases in annual precipitation.",

      "citations": 7,
      "abstract": "Understanding the cloud impact on forest evapotranspiration (ET) is crucial for studying the interaction of vegetation‐cloud‐atmosphere. Combining long‐term (2003–2010) satellite passive microwave observations and in‐situ measurements, a non‐linear response of canopy‐scale ET to cloud increase was found at a temperate forest in Northeast China. As cloud increased, an initial enhancement (4%–10%) in ET occurred under less cloudy sky, while a significant reduction (>20%) in ET occurred under more cloudy sky. The phenomenon existed under both high and low vegetation water content (VWC) indicated by satellite microwave emissivity difference vegetation index (EDVI). Analysis showed that this was the combined effect from the enhancement (5%–30%) in evaporative fraction (EF) and the reduction (5%–50%) in net radiation under cloud increase. Decoupling analysis based on coefficients ( ρ ) of path analysis model showed that enhanced EF ( ρ > 0.61) rather than radiation ( ρ  0.63) and could not be compensated by increased EF ( ρ < 0.48) under more cloudy sky. EF enhancement under clouds was strongly correlated with the decline in canopy resistance (Rs) which was dominated by vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Higher VWC increased ET via reducing Rs and enlarging EF. This positive effect of VWC was more noticeable under less cloudy sky. Associated mechanisms could be related to the dynamic controls of plant physiology and environmental conditions induced by VWC and clouds. This study highlighted the dynamic effect of clouds and VWC on forest ET and improved our knowledge of vegetation‐cloud interactions.",

      "abstract": "Anthropogenic impacts on terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) changes during 1980–2020 were evaluated based on newly released observed‐based GLEAM ET and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) through optional fingerprint method. Global assessments show that anthropogenic forcings dominate the increasing ET trend, other than natural forcing (NAT). On the global scale, anthropogenic forcings explain ∼84.2% of the observed ET trend, while the signal of natural forcing cannot be detected. Among anthropogenic forcings, greenhouse gases (GHG) are the primary driving factor for ET changes, and GHG‐only has already explained ∼78.8% of the observed ET trend. This study for the first time demonstrates that the GHG signal can be detected in the observed‐based ET and can be separable from NAT and aerosol (AER) signals. At the regional scale, CMIP6 simulations work well in North Hemisphere, but are deficient in South Hemisphere. GHG still dominates ET changes in the North Hemisphere, except for Europe, where the influence of AER forcing stands out, and attributable changes to AER is 2.4 times of GHG. Our first quantitative detection and attribution of ET contribute to advance the understanding of anthropogenic activities on hydrological cycle changes.",

This study presents a novel Blended Dry and Hot Events Index (BDHI) considering various dry and hot conditions (i.e., dry/hot, dry/cool, wet/hot, and wet/cool conditions). BDHI was applied to monitor dry‐hot events over global land areas during the 1950–2019 period and its performance was compared against that of the Standardized Compound Event Indicator (SCEI), which includes certain unsatisfactory or unclear features. We found that BDHI comprehensively reflected the characteristics of meteorological drought and temperature anomalies in monitoring dry‐hot events. Many regions around the globe have been experiencing more severe dry‐hot events since the 1990s, especially Russia, the USA, China, India, Australia, southern Africa, Europe, and South America. The proposed index is expected to serve as a potential tool for monitoring dry‐hot events and will be useful for managing and mitigating associated risks.",

      "abstract": "Extreme precipitation of multiple durations is responsible for major natural hazards in mountainous regions, such as flash floods and debris flows. Understanding the orographic impact on the statistics of precipitation extremes is therefore crucial for improving hydrological design and risk management strategies. Here, we use a novel statistical approach for the analysis of extremes based on ordinary events to improve our understanding of the orographic impact on extreme precipitation of durations ranging between 5 min and 24 h. We focus on Trentino, a rough orographic region in the eastern Italia Alps, and use data from 78 quality-controlled rain gauges with 5-minute resolution. We show that our framework well reproduces the statistical properties of the observed annual maxima (Nash-Sutcliffe 0.82–0.95, Bias from -4% to 7%) as well as their relation with orography. We then exploit the reduced uncertainty of this approach to quantify the orographic impact on precipitation right-tail statistics and on extreme return levels using a regression analysis. We identify two main modes of orographic relationship: a reverse orographic effect for hourly and sub-hourly durations (10–20% decrease per 1000 m elevation) and an orographic enhancement for durations of ∼8 h or longer (7.5–10% increase per 1000 m elevation). We observe that these two modes result from three main precipitation regimes, which show different proportion between extreme and very-extreme events and which emerge at very short durations (∼20 min or shorter), mid durations (∼30 min-1 hour) and long durations (∼2 h or longer). These findings are of interest for risk management applications and climate change impact studies.",

      "citations": 29,
      "abstract": "Under global warming, extreme hydrological events are experiencing increasingly violent fluctuations. Investigating changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation (EP) events is particularly critical for understanding the hydrological response to climate change. Based on high-precision and long-term daily grid precipitation data obtained from Asian Precipitation-Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE), 25 EP indices were examined for the Tienshan Mountains region of Central Asia (TMCA). Here, the relationship between EP and associated large-scale climate teleconnections is revealed by using a series of approaches such as trend analysis and the geographical detector method (GMD), a statistical tool to measure and attribute spatial stratified heterogeneity. The results show an overall increase in EP during 1951–2014, as reflected in the 25 indices. Furthermore, the number of consecutive dry days (CDD) decreased from 87.02 to 69.35 while the number of consecutive wet days (CWD) increased from 3.89 to 4.61. Meanwhile, the increasing trend of total precipitation (PRCPTOT) was 18.43 mm/10a, and changes in EP frequency were shown to increase with event rareness. For R95p, the observed changes in frequency are 34.46%, but these jump to 96.58% for R99p. Moreover, the study also notes that changes in EP are elevation-dependent, with middle altitude areas (1500–3500 m) being most sensitive to change rates. As well, the study reveals that the occurrence of EP responds non-linearly to climatic teleconnections, and that the combined effect of two factors generally make much larger contributions to EP than the summation of individual factors. Further analyses indicate strong zonal circulation at 500 hPa, 1000 hPa potential height increases airflow from west to east. And the weakening of the East Asian Summer Monsoon accompanied by the westward extension of the western Pacific subtropical high and the increase in Mongolian anticyclone activity all bring sufficient exogenous water vapor from the North Atlantic and Indian Ocean to the TMCA.",

      "abstract": "Hydrometeorological extreme value analysis (EVA) is complicated with multiple-uncertain methodological choices, such as extreme event sampling (EES), stationary/non-stationary assumption (SNA), and parameter estimation (PE). In this study, a factorial extreme value analysis (FEVA) method is developed through integrating four EESs, four SNAs and two PEs into a mixed-level factorial experiment framework. FEVA can not only identify the main factors that influence the risk assessment of hydrometeorological extremes, but also reflect main and interactive effects of such complex uncertainties. FEVA is applied to Central Asia for analyzing maximum 1-day precipitation (P max ), maximum daily temperature (T max ) and minimum daily temperature (T min ), where data from 32 long-term (1881–2018) observation stations are adopted and 32 scenarios are examined. Main findings are: (1) during the 20th century, the occurrences of precipitation and temperature extremes were increased in Central Asia, and minimum temperature extreme increases faster than maximum temperature extreme; (2) the dominated factor affecting the return levels of P max , T max and T min is EES, with average contributions of 32.9%, 47.0% and 53.5%, respectively; (3) the interaction between PE and EES has an obvious effect on the return levels, and its impacts occupy 17.8% for P max , 9.5% for T max and 4.5% for T min ; (4) based on graphical and Goodness-of-Fit (GoF) metrics methods, appropriate threshold values of [11.57, 37.63] mm for P max , [34.15, 44.46] °C for T max and [−40.07, −10.83] °C for T min are obtained (larger than 99th percentile of the observed value) in Central Asia, which can improve the simulation and prediction accuracy of hydrometeorological extremes.",

      "citations": 7,
      "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important part of the hydrological cycle, significantly influencing water distribution, energy cycle, and plant growth. In the context of global warming and acceleration of the water cycle, it is of great significance to analyse the trend and attribution of ET on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is most a sensitive and vulnerable area of the world. In this article, ET products, obtained from the improved Penman–Monteith–Leuning model with 1 km spatial resolution and 8 days temporal resolution, were used to investigate the trend and attribution of modelled ET and its components on the TP during the 2003–2017 period. The modelling results show the ET, soil evaporation (E), and vegetation transpiration (T) present a highly similar spatial pattern, with a distinct decreasing gradient from the humid southeastern areas to the arid northwestern areas of the plateau. In terms of its components, E (269 mm yr −1 ) contributes about 70% of ET (385 mm yr −1 ), especially in the northwestern region. Although the relationship between ET and elevation is not clear, the results showed that E increased with elevation, while T exhibited the opposite trend. At the same time, approximately 80% of the grids showed an increasing trend (increasing at a rate of 4.7 mm yr −1 ), mainly concentrated in the southeastern area, where the increased ET in forests and alpine meadows was the most obvious. Variations of modelled ET on the TP is distinguished into energy‐restricted and water‐restricted regions, corresponding respectively to the eastern region affected by temperature, and the western region controlled by soil moisture. The results of the present study can greatly improve our understanding of the hydrological cycle and the ability to manage water resources on the TP within the context of global climate change.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis to identify and quantify spatial patterns of heavy, very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall and their trends that have emerged during the last seven decades (1951 to 2020) of monsoon months (June to September) under warming scenario as well as to project these extreme rainfall counts during the near- (2036–2060) and late-21st century (2075–2099) w.r.t. historical period (1990–2014) using bias-corrected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-6 (CMIP6) multi-model ensemble method. On the basis of daily maximum rainfall occurrences, the Central India, North-East India, Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats are found to be susceptible to extreme rainfall zones over the Indian landmass. The trend distribution during 1951–2020 suggests an increase of 42–63 heavy rainfall events over Orissa, Chattisgarh and parts of Madhya Pradesh and a declination over Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and hilly regions of North-East India. Our study suggests the causal theory for the rise of monsoon rainfall extremes in terms of both dynamics and local-scale thermodynamics over the sub-continent. Moreover, the bias-corrected dataset is developed using Empirical Quantile Mapping (EQM) for historic and projected climate for the three scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5) using output from 20 General Circulation Models (GCMs) from CMIP6. Hence, the bias-corrected projections suggest that most susceptible places for increasing heavy rainfall extremes likely to be Mumbai, Pune, Panaji in the Western coasts of India (Western Ghats), Itanagar and Shillong in the North-East India, Raipur and Bhopal in the Central India in near- and late-21st century under all scenarios in a warming climate. Thus, the bias-corrected projections from CMIP6-GCMs can be used for hydroclimate impact assessment in Indian region under the changing atmospheric circulation dynamics and warming induced by greenhouse gases.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 18,
      "abstract": "Accurate rainfall datasets with high temporal and spatial resolutions are crucial for most hydrological applications. One potentially valuable source of rainfall data that has consistent spatial and temporal resolutions are atmospheric reanalysis products. However, while such data sets can provide a physically consistent representation of rainfall over large spatial and temporal extents, they are generally less accurate than observed datasets at daily scales. In contrast, while the gauge measurements are accurate source of rainfall data, sub-daily observations are spatially sparse and are of shorter length than daily observations. While the temporal resolution of daily observations can be enhanced using temporal disaggregation methods, they are often applied stochastically with a focus on capturing the fine-scale statistical properties rather than generating a best estimate time series useful for hindcasting purposes. The increasing availability of high resolution regional reanalysis products prompts the question whether they can be used to temporally disaggregate daily observations to derive high-resolution estimates of sub-daily rainfalls suitable for hydrologic applications. This study investigates the efficacy of a simple disaggregation approach to temporally disaggregate daily rainfalls to hourly values using a regional reanalysis at moderate spatial resolutions. The approach is tested on attributes relevant to a wide range of hydrological applications. The selected performance metrics include the distribution and frequency of various sub-daily rainfall accumulations, statistics characterising the sequencing and central tendency of sub-daily rainfalls, and the efficacy of areal estimates of sub-daily rainfalls for simulating catchment streamflows. Categorical evaluation shows that the disaggregated rainfalls reduce the frequency of false alarms and improves the probability of detection compared to the use of raw reanalysis estimates. However, a mixed performance in capturing fine-scale statistical characteristics suggests that the disaggregation approach is less robust for applications that rely solely on high-resolution rainfall characteristics. In hydrological evaluation, when compared to estimates based on raw reanalysis or uniformly disaggregated daily observations, the disaggregated catchment rainfalls improve the simulation of the magnitude and timing of peak flows, and the accuracy of derived flood frequency estimates. The proposed disaggregation method is easily applied to any high-resolution dataset and has the potential to be used in hydrological applications that rely heavily on sub-daily characterisation, with a varying performance across the target applications.",

Cluster analysis and L-moment approach were used to identify the homogenous precipitation regions. In general, increasing precipitation trends between 1960 and 2016 were evident. Results indicated increasing precipitation in winter, autumn, summer and annual scale at the rates of 0.20, 2.18, 5.16, and 10.89 mmÁdecade− 1, respectively. In spring, the precipitation trend shows a decreasing trend at− 0.67 mmÁdecade− 1. Moreover, a significant decreasing trend occurred in winter in southern Pakistan. The overall increasing trends were more noticeable between 1960 and 1988, compared to the declining precipitation during 1989–2016. SQMK analysis indicates a clear downward trend in most regions during 1989–2016, except in autumn. Annual precipitation has increased topographically except at 500 m and 1,500 m during 1960–2016 with a significant increase of 1.37 mmÁdecade− 1 at elevation< 250 m. Results indicate a negative correlation in SS test value with seasonal and annual precipitation with elevation and a positive correlation in winter.

      "abstract": "This study focuses on the trends and the causes of variation in actual evapotranspiration (AET) around the warming hiatus over China by a comprehensive analysis applying various temporal–spatial methods. It is observed that the annual AET showed a different trend around 2000 for China as a whole. By employing segmented regression analysis for detecting warming hiatus points, high temporal inconsistency can be found in eight climatic regions of China. The impacts of meteorological variables on AET were further identified by affecting the intensity and relative change of meteorological factors. AET was highly correlated (p<. 01) with solar radiation in the southeast (R= 0.80) and air specific humidity in the northwest areas (R= 0.83). AET changes presented the highest sensitivity to specific humidity in Northwest before 2006 and in north central China after 2003, with sensitivity coefficients of 1.48 and 1.74, respectively. Three variables, including air specific humidity (with an average contribution rate of $17% in the northwest), short-wave radiation and air temperature, can be the main factors that lead to the changes in AET. The specific meteorological factors varied from region to region: the changes in AET can be ascribed to the increased wind and short-wave radiation in north central China and east China, the decreased air temperature in Tibetan Plateau, the increased specific humidity in southeast China during warming hiatus, and so on. After the warming hiatus occurred, the dominant factor of AET trends changed from air specific humidity to short-wave radiation and other factors. Generally, air specific humidity and air temperature have played leading roles in AET trends during the past 30 years.",

      "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) is sensitive to environmental factors. Accurate assessment of ET and its response to changing environments have important scientific and practical significance. In the context of global climate change, China has experienced tremendous land use/land cover change (LUCC) processes, leaving its ET dynamics and influencing factors still to be determined. Here, the interannual variation and spatial distribution characteristics of ET over China from 2005 to 2020 were analyzed based on the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) model. Then the separate contributions of climate change and LUCC to ET variation were quantified by controlling the LUCC scenario of the PT-JPL model. Results indicated that the PT-JPL model could accurately capture the variation of ET. The average annual ET over China from 2005 to 2020 was 464.52 mm, displaying a slightly increasing trend (0.46 mm·yr −1 ). The regions of ET increase were mainly concentrated in southern, central, and northeastern China. Separating the contributions of climate change and LUCC to ET revealed that climate change has a more significant effect on ET than LUCC. Among the five climatic factors, the contributions of relative humidity and precipitation to ET variation in dry basins were greater than those in humid or high-altitude basins, while temperature, net radiation, and wind speed showed an opposite performance. Net radiation and temperature were identified as the most critical factors affecting ET on the national scale. According to China's LUCC data from 2005 to 2020, the area conversion between forestlands, grasslands, and croplands was more significant than that between other land cover types. Wetlands and forestlands corresponded to higher ET values among all land cover types, and conversion to other land cover types would cause a decrease in ET. This study can support policymaking to improve water use efficiency and optimize water resource management.",

      "abstract": "Perception of the spatio-temporal events of extreme precipitation and their variations is essential for diminishing the natural hazards linked with extreme events. In this research, a satellite-based precipitation dataset derived from remotely sensed soil moisture (SM2RAIN-ASCAT, obtained from ASCAT satellite soil moisture data through the Soil Moisture to Rain algorithm) was selected to evaluate the accuracy of daily precipitation and extreme events estimations against a regional gridded weather dataset by employing various performance indicators, and ETCCDI indicators (CDD, and CWD, SDII, R10mm, R20mm, R95p, R99p, Rx1day, and Rx5day). The study area includes entire Poland as well as small parts of Ukraine, Belarus, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Russia, and Germany. According to PBIAS (~ −3.9 %) and coefficient of correlation (~0.74), SM2RAIN-ASCAT has good accuracy in the study area. Assessments reveal that, in general, over southern, mountainous part SM2RAIN-ASCAT does not have accurate estimations. According to the reference dataset, during the 2007–2019 period, on average, the length of dry days was ~22 days, while SM2RAIN-ASCAT shows ~19.6 consecutive dry days. In contrast, SM2RAIN-ASCAT overestimated (16 days/year) the consecutive wet days compared to the reference dataset (~8.7 days/year). SM2RAIN-ASCAT underestimated the number of heavy precipitation days index (R10mm) over the northern part of the region, close to the Baltic Sea), but the accuracy increased in the southern parts. SM2RAIN-ASCAT underestimated the maximum 1-day rainfall total and relative max 5-day precipitation amount indices. The total precipitation divided by the amount of wet days index shows that SM2RAIN-ASCAT has relatively acceptable accuracy in the center and south of the study area. Our results show that SM2RAIN-ASCAT should be improved for relatively higher extreme indicators.",

Accompanying wetter boreal spring and summer, the interannual rainfall variability for these seasons is also enhanced. A novel moisture budget analysis shows that changes in mean background humidity (anomalous wind convergence) dominate the increase in the interannual variability in spring (summer). Extreme daily precipitation in these seasons (based on the 95th percentile) is projected to become more intense, roughly following the Clausius–Clapeyron (CC) relation for the aforementioned seasons. On the other hand, the annual number of maximum consecutive dry days (CDD) is found to increase by about 3 to 5 days over locations south of 32° N, where autumn mean rainfall rate is projected to reduce (although this might be subjected to models' ability in capturing tropical cyclone activities). Analyses of the GCM raw outputs indicate that strengthened northerlies over coastal East Asia, which is likely associated with the so‐called tropical expansion, are responsible for the drier autumn.",

      "abstract": "In this study, future projections of monthly total precipitation and monthly average temperatures are carried out using 22 global circulation models (GCMs) from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) of the Mediterranean region. The Multi-Model Ensembles (MME) are created with GCMs that best estimate observed values with the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based statistical downscaling method. The performance of GCMs is evaluated with six different statistical performance criteria. The MMEs are found to be better than used individual GCMs in simulating historical temperature and precipitation in the region. The projections are made for the years 2021–2100 according to the two integrated scenarios of socio-economic development and greenhouse gas emissions (SSP2–4.5, SSP5–8.5). The projections with the MMEs show that decreasing precipitation is calculated as 15% for SSP2–4.5 and 20% for SSP5–8.5. Also, the increase in temperature is found between 1.0 and 2.2 °C and between 1.8 and 3.1 °C for the SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5, respectively. In addition, the possible decrease in precipitation in the coastal part of the region is higher than in other regions. On the other hand, possible temperature increases in the region's high altitudes have been determined more than in the coastal areas.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we estimated a comprehensive set of extreme precipitation indices defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) over North America (NA) using 18 selected higher-resolution GCMs of the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The GCMs are evaluated in their historical simulations (1981–2010) against those estimated from in-situ (Daymet) and reanalysis (NARR) dataasets, followed by the projected changes in precipitation extremes of NA in response to climate warming (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) scenarios of CMIP6 in terms of temporal variations, spatial distributions, seasonal patterns and model agreement over the 21st century relative to 1981–2010. Results show that the CMIP6 ensemble median (CMIP6-EnM) can generally capture the observed extreme precipitation patterns of NA, and it out-performs all 18 individual GCMs with negative RMSE′ XY, higher R statistics (R> 0.8) and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)> 1 in most sub-regions of NA. In general, extreme precipitation events are projected to occur more frequently and severely in the future, particularly in latitudes above 55° N of NA and in coastal areas. In contrast, dry conditions in southern NA (eg, NCA and SCA) are projected to intensify over the 21st century. Seasonal changes are projected to be more significant in winter than in summer for northern NA (eg, GIC, NWN and NEN), while in Central America (eg, WNA, CAN, ENA), precipitation extremes will likely be less severe in both summer and winter. However, unlike strong model agreements in high (100%) and mid-latitudes (80%), there is often a wide disparity among the signs of projected changes between GCMs in southern NA. Unless greenhouse gas emissions are drastically reduced immediately, NA will likely be vulnerable to the impact of worsening extreme precipitation events especially in northern and coastal regions.",

This study brings a non-traditional approach focused on the link between climatic patterns and hydrological processes and their social-economic consequences, such as their effect on energy production. The methodology used data from the precipitation, natural streamflow, and AMO and PDO series. These variables were evaluated by wavelet transform analysis (WTA), flow duration curve (FDC), streamflow that is equalled or exceed ed 90% of the time (Q90), the reliability index (RI) for different demands and the hydropower generated. The results suggest that the WTA for the SFRB was more significant on the inter-annual scale, and the period with opposite phases of AMO(−) and PDO(+) showed the highest values of FDC, Q90, RI and hydropower generated simulated for the SFRB.",

      "abstract": "Water competition is a key issue in the study of the water-food-energy nexus (WFEN), which can affect water, food, and energy security and can generate notable challenges in water resource management. Since Bayesian network can express parameter uncertainty with a certain probability distribution while reflecting the dependencies of each variable, this study used a Bayesian network to model the WFEN in the Pearl River Region (PRR). The network structure can intuitively represent complex causal relationships, and the form of the probability distribution can effectively reflect the variable uncertainty. The responses of the Bayesian network model under different scenarios were used to analyse the major influencing factors, and water competition relationships in various sectors were explored. The results indicated that water competition between the different sectors was very complex and could dynamically change under the different scenarios. For example, an increase in hydropower and flow to sea could lead to a decrease in irrigation water, but an increase in irrigation water did not necessarily reduce hydropower and flow to sea. Water for hydropower generation and salt tide alleviation were obviously affected by the total offstream water use, but there existed no obvious water competition between these aspects in general. However, when offstream water use remained stable, a competitive relationship was observed between hydropower and flow to sea. Overall, the outcomes of this study could be of great significance to further analyse the WFEN in other regions.",

      "abstract": "Despite the importance of Water-Energy-Food (WEF) evaluations in disseminating information about WEF security challenges, no study on WEF security at a State or Union Territory (UT) level has been conducted in India. We have quantitatively analysed the WEF nexus at State/UT level in India using Pardee RAND WEF Nexus Index (PR-WEFNI) for 2015–16 and 2019–20. The Government of India has implemented several policies to ensure India's WEF security. However, none of the studies have analysed the potential impact of implemented policies in WEF nexus changes. We have proposed an indicator-based approach, i.e., a Policy Implementation Score (PIS), which indicates a policy's progress (in %). PIS is calculated by aggregating indicators related to WEF policy implementation to quantitatively investigate the impact of implemented governmental policies on WEF nexus changes. Results indicated significant variations in WEF sub-indices across States/UTs over the two years under consideration. Most States/UTs showed an increase in the Water Sub-index (WSI) and Energy Sub-index (ESI) due to higher values of Water PIS and Energy PIS but a decrease/no changes in the Food sub-index (FSI) due to lower Food PIS. Moreover, overall WSI, ESI, FSI and WEFNI of India increased by 15%, 6.6%, 0.1% and 8%, respectively, in 2019–20 compared to 2015–16. This study assessed the WEF security status of Indian States/UTs, which helped to recognise respective resource-insecure areas. This approach can help policymakers identify problems, make further modifications, and develop area-specific policies to achieve resource security across India's States/UTs and other developing economies worldwide.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 49,
      "abstract": "To study hydrological events, such as floods and droughts, frequency analysis (FA) techniques are commonly employed. FA relies on some assumptions, especially, the stationarity of the data series. However, the stationarity assumption is not always fulfilled for a variety of reasons such as climate change and human activities. Thus, it is essential to check the stationarity or we should develop models that take into account the non-stationarity in a new risk assessment framework. On the other hand, a majority of hydrological phenomena are described by a number of correlated characteristics. To model the dependence structure between these hydrological variables, copulas are the most employed tool. Generally in the literature, the multivariate model is assumed to be the same over time even though multivariate stationarity is required. Considering the non-stationarity in the dependence structure is important because when the copula parameter changes, the multivariate quantile curve changes accordingly. Different scenarios can be considered when choosing a multivariate non-stationary model since several variables and a dependence structure are involved. The objective of the present study is to construct a model that integrates simultaneously multivariate and non-stationarity aspects along with hypothesis testing. For the copula part, we consider versions called Dynamic copulas and series of association measures are obtained through rolling windows of the corresponding series. Adapted versions of the AIC criterion are employed to select the final model (margins and copula). The procedure is applied to a flood volume and peak dataset from Iran. The obtained model constitutes of a lognormal distribution for the margins with linear trend in the peak series, stationary for the volume series and a quadratic trend in the logistic Gumbel copula parameter for the dependence structure.",

      "abstract": "In this study, an uncertainty analysis of extreme precipitation return levels was performed for the Chaliyar river basin, India, under representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Weighted average projections of various climate models (for RCPs 4.5 and 8.5) using reliability ensemble averaging were used in the analysis for projecting the future extremes. To start with, the presence of nonstationarity in the observed annual maximum precipitation (AMP) series and the future ensemble averaged AMP projections were investigated. For this purpose, three generalized extreme value (GEV) models—one stationary model with constant parameters and two nonstationary models with trends in location and scale parameters—were applied to assess the goodness of fit using Akaike information criterion and likelihood ratio test. The best fit model was used in the uncertainty analysis, and the confidence bounds of extreme precipitation return levels were estimated. A nonparametric bootstrapping approach was followed in the uncertainty analysis. Results of the study suggest that a nonstationary GEV distribution with linear trend in location parameter and constant scale and shape parameters are the best fit distribution for the AMP series under the RCP scenarios, whereas the stationary GEV distribution fits the observed AMP series the best. The expected values and confidence bounds of return levels obtained from the uncertainty analysis reveal that precipitation extremes in the river basin would intensify under the projected climate change scenarios. Compared with the RCP4.5 scenario, the confidence intervals of return levels under the RCP8.5 scenario were wider, implying that uncertainty in the latter scenario is higher.",

      "abstract": "Increasing global trends in time series of annual maximum daily streamflow (AMX) raise the concern that the safety of dams and other sensitive structures is compromised. There is no defined methodology to estimate the design flood (DF) under non-stationarity; thus, the objective of this work is to evaluate the behavior of the hydrological risk of Brazilian dams due to the non-stationary nature of the AMX time series and the implications of the non-stationary nature of the AMX time series in the design of new dams. For this, the hydrological risk of 108 AMX time series was evaluated, comparing the time intervals between 1954–1984 and 1954–2014. A case study was also executed, where the DF was estimated in a non-stationary time series. The generalized distribution of extreme values (GEV) was applied in the time series analyses. The results indicate that the hydrological risk of Brazilian dams increased, and safety may have been reduced. Regarding the ranking of models, the use of physical covariates in the estimate of the DF makes the estimates more reliable. Finally, although significant trends are good indicators, they alone do not guarantee a reduction or increase in risk. It was also observed that using non-stationary models is less important than updating the estimates with newly observed data.",

      "abstract": "Water infrastructure design and flood mitigation projects are currently based on a so-called stationary assumption. However, this assumption has been challenged in recent years due to increased extreme weather, potentially leading to the underestimation of flood quantiles and an increased risk of structural failures. In the present study, peak flow series from 158 gauging stations in the UK are analysed using both stationary and non-stationary models based on the generalised additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) framework. Nine candidate covariates are used for non-stationary models to obtain information on the significant drivers of non-stationarity in each flood series. Very few stations are thus found to show temporal trends, which suggests that time-varying non-stationary flood models may not always be suitable, and the use of physically-based covariates can provide better-fitting models. In particular, the non-stationary models using rainfall-related covariates display the best performance for the vast majority of stations, thus suggesting that the variability of the rainfall regime remains the dominant driver for changes in flooding. Moreover, two atmospheric circulation patterns, namely the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the East Atlantic Pattern, were found to be closely related to the non-stationarity of flooding at a number of stations. Unlike rainfall, however, the influence of these climate indices is not particularly dominant; hence, they are more suitably employed as components of a multiple-covariate non-stationary model. Besides, a direct linkage between the variability of flooding and climate changes has not been identified either regionally or globally. For the majority of stations (70%), the use of multiple covariates can provide a better non-stationary model than the use of a single covariate.",

      "abstract": "Drought is a multifaceted natural phenomenon with diverse spatial and temporal characteristics and significant environmental, social, and economic effects. The utility of conventional drought indices based on the assumption of stationarity is questionable due to the advent of rapid environmental change. We proposed a non-stationary standardized precipitation index (SPI NS ) to reassess the nature of meteorological drought. Precipitation observations from eight rain gauge stations for 1961–2017 in South Korea were fitted to a non-stationary gamma distribution using a generalized additive model in location, scale, and shape algorithm. Drought duration and severity were identified by SPI NS and joint and conditional return periods were estimated using copula-based bivariate probabilities. The results show that average drought duration, severity, and frequency obtained from SPI NS were more severe than those produced by a conventional standardized precipitation index (SPI C ). The average inter-arrival time was 41.46 months and 39.86 months for SPI C and SPI NS , respectively, at the Seoul station. The joint return periods of observed drought event from March 2008 to June 2008 with a duration of 4 months and a severity of 4.8 were 10.4 and 6.4 years for the SPI C and SPI NS , respectively, at the Seoul station. We conclude that return periods calculated using the SPI NS are more reliable than those calculated by the SPI C . These findings should prove helpful in drought management and risk assessment under a changing environment as effective management requires prior knowledge of events.",

      "citations": 5,
      "abstract": "In the nonstationary hydrological frequency analysis (NS-HFA), the profile likelihood (PL) method has shown superiority in uncertainty estimation due to its higher accuracy and realistic asymmetric estimates. However, its wide application has been hindered by two issues, namely the high computational burden and the numerical instability problems arising when dealing with short datasets. This paper aimed to solve or mitigate these two issues. To reduce its computational burden, the classical regula-falsi numerical method was incorporated into the PL method (namely, the RF-PL method) for estimating the bounds of the confidence intervals through an explicit analytical expression of the reparametrized log-likelihood function rather than computing the full profile. The generalized maximum likelihood principle, which constrains the distribution shape parameter to a physically/statistically reasonable range, was extended to the proposed RF-PL method (namely, the RF-GPL method) to handle short datasets. The proposed methods were applied to eight annual maximum series of flow and precipitation from North America, which present temporal trends in the mean and/or the standard deviation, to demonstrate their efficiency. The results showed that the RF-PL method substantially reduced the computational time of the PL method by 94–96% without degrading its estimation accuracy. Moreover, the RF-GPL was proven to be effective in avoiding or substantially mitigating the numerical instability issue of the RF-PL method for small sample sizes in addition to reducing the uncertainty in the estimates. As expected, the superiority of the RF-GPL method decreases with the increase of the sample size, which is beneficial in enhancing the estimation of the shape parameter in the RF-PL method. Therefore, the RF-GPL method is advantageous over the RF-PL method for short datasets, whereas its outperformance would be case-dependent for long datasets. These advancements overcome the common hurdles of the PL method and consequently enable its practical implementation more widely in the NS-HFA.",

      "abstract": "Significant nonstationarity of hydrological sequences, driven by the coupled influence of climate change and anthropogenic activities, has challenged traditional hydrological drought analysis under the stationarity assumption in some regions, and has questioned regional hydrological drought analysis under the changing environment. To evaluate hydrological drought characteristics, the novelty of this paper is the proposition of a GAMLSS (Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape)-based nonstationary standardized runoff index (NSRI), considering climate change and anthropogenic influence, for investigating the hydrological drought regime in the Wuding River basin. To that end, nonstationary test methods were performed on hydrological sequences, and data was segmented into three parts according to the results of the Pettitt test. A nonstationary probability distribution was fitted to runoff data with meteorological covariates (precipitation, temperature) and anthropogenic covariates (water consumption for social development demand, and water consumption triggered by water impounding by check dams). After selecting an optimal combination of covariates, the NSRI was calculated utilizing the GAMLSS model. A newly constructed evaluation threshold was proposed, based on the traditional SRI threshold. The performance of SRI and NSRI were compared at the Dingjiagou station in the Wuding River basin. Results of comparison between index identification and recorded drought events demonstrated that the NSRI better performed in drought event identification. Moreover, the NSRI identified more frequent severe droughts and extreme droughts. Therefore, the proposed NSRI provided a more accurate basis for the identification of drought events, which can offer valuable information for drought planning, preparedness, and mitigation.",

We modelled extreme precipitation according to the extreme values theory and calculated the precipitation intensity associated with the return periods of 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 years in nonstationary conditions. The results indicate that nonstationarity is identified in 17.5% of the study area during 1980–2015. The analysis of future climate projections indicated an increase in the return levels of extreme precipitation compared to the historical period in at least 90% of the national territory.

      "abstract": "Conventional water infrastructure designs for flood and low flows are usually based on the assumption of stationarity of extreme events. However, recent evidence suggests that the influences of climate variability and human activities have made the hypothesis of stationarity questionable. In this study, we used the generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) to construct a nonstationary model in which the parameters of the selected distributions were modelled as a function of climatic variables (i.e., climate indices and precipitation) and/or the reservoir index (RI). The nonstationary models were then used to analyse annual flood and low flow frequency at four hydrological stations in the upper reaches of the Huaihe River Basin, including Dapoling (DPL), Changtaiguan (CTG), Zhuganpu (ZGP), and Xixian (XX) stations. Annual floods were represented by the maximum daily streamflow in each year, and low flows were represented by the 95th quantile of the daily streamflow (Q 95 ) in each year. The change point and trend analysis revealed that the flood series of the ZGP station and the low flow series of the DPL and XX stations exhibited significant downward and upward trends ( p < 0.1)), respectively. The low flow series of the ZGP station showed a significant change point in 1980 ( p < 0.1). GAMLSS modelling results showed that, in comparison with stationary models, nonstationary models that included precipitation and the Arctic Oscillation climate index as covariates for the gamma distribution location parameter provided a superior description of the flood series at the four stations. Nonstationary models that incorporated precipitation and/or RI as covariates for the Weibull distribution parameters fit the low flow series better than stationary models at all stations. Furthermore, we found that nonstationary models outperformed stationary models in terms of flood frequency analysis, covering all flood observation points and capturing the generally decreasing trend in flood series, as well as a decrease in the scatter of estimated flood value magnitudes. For the low flow frequency analysis, the comparison results showed that the nonstationary and stationary models performed identically for the DPL, CTG, and XX stations, where no significant change point was detected. However, for the ZGP station, where a significant change point was detected, the nonstationary models performed better than the stationary models and could accurately capture the changes in the magnitude of the estimated low flow values before and after the change point. Overall, the proposed nonstationary model can serve as a tool for nonstationary frequency analysis of flood and low flow series under the influence of climate variability and reservoir regulations, thus providing a reference for regional water infrastructure design.",

This study explores the nonstationary flood history of the Las Vegas Wash (LVW) watershed by deconstructing it into its constituent physical drivers. Observations and reanalysis products are used to examine the hydroclimatology, hydrometeorology, and hydrology of flash flooding in the watershed. Annual peak flows have increased nonlinearly over the past seven decades, with an abrupt changepoint detected in the mid-1990s, which is attributed to the implementation of flood conveyance systems rather than changes in land use. The LVW watershed exhibits two pronounced flood seasons, associated with distinct synoptic atmospheric circulations: winter floods linked to inland-penetrating atmospheric rivers and summer floods linked to the North American monsoon. El Niño–Southern Oscillation also plays a role in modulating extreme rainfall and the resultant floods because annual maximum daily rainfall totals positively correlate with El Niño, with Spearman’s correlation coefficient of 0.36 ( p value < 0.05). Winter maximum daily rainfall totals have increased since 1950, whereas summer daily rainfall maxima have decreased. The trends in hydrometeorological drivers interact with urbanization to shift flood seasonality toward more frequent winter floods in the LVW watershed. A process-based understanding of the flood hydrology of the watershed also provides insights into flood frequency analysis and flood forecasting.",

      "abstract": "Global climate change and reservoir regulations can alter the natural flow of rivers. Influenced by these two drivers, flood sequences may no longer satisfy the assumption of stationary, thereby making it difficult to accurately analysis flood frequency and to design water conservancy projects. Therefore, it is of great significance to analyse the non-stationary frequency of flood sequences in a changing environment. In this study, we proposed a method for conducting nonstationary flood frequency analysis caused by cascade reservoirs as well as the low-frequency climate indices. The proposed non-stationary model 2, with the explanatory variables of climate indices and modified reservoir index (MRI), was compared with the traditional stationary model and the widely used non-stationary model 1 with time as the explanatory variable. The study was conducted at six hydrological stations in the main stream and tributaries of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in China (considered as the Three Gorges Reservoir Area). The results of the generalized additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) showed that the Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion values of the proposed non-stationary model method 2 are smaller than those of the two comparison models. When the low-frequency South Oscillation Index is high or the Arctic Oscillation and North Pacific Oscillation are low, the stationary model underestimates the design value of flood quantiles compared with the non-stationary model 2. Compared with the non-stationary model 1, the MRI and low-frequency climate indices as the explanatory variables in model 2 can better describe the non-stationary characteristics of flood frequency and amplitude. In addition, the non-stationary model considering external physical factors can provide better prediction of future design flood compared with two traditional models.",

      "abstract": "Climatic drivers of floods have been widely used to improve nonstationary flood frequency analysis (FFA). However, the forecast ability of nonstationary FFA with out-of-sample prediction has not been comprehensively evaluated. We use 379 flood records from Brazil to assess the ability of process-informed nonstationary models for out-of-sample FFA using the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. Five drivers of floods are used as covariates: annual temperature, El Nino Southern Oscillation, annual rainfall, annual maximum rainfall, and annual maximum soil moisture content. Our results reveal that a nonstationary model is preferable when there is a significant correlation between flood and climate covariates in both the training period and full record. The rainfall-based covariates lead to better out-of-sample nonstationary FFA models. These findings highlight that using climate information as covariates in nonstationary FFA is a promising approach for estimating future floods and, hence, better infrastructure design, risk assessment and disaster preparedness.",

This study investigates nonstationary partial duration series (PDS) records for the period 1971–2017 at 14 hydrological stations across the Gorganrood River Basin, Iran. The Gorganrood Basin is very diverse in terms of climate such as humid, semihumid, Mediterranean, semiarid, and arid climates. Change points are analyzed using the Pettitt technique. Trends of PDS are detected using the Mann–Kendall method. The nonstationarity of the PDS series is examined by generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS). Results indicate that abrupt changes are significant for the PDS series in the Gorganrood River Basin. Change points have a considerable effect on trend detection, and these may be attributed to the fact that an abrupt increase or decrease in mean values affects trend changes. In addition, the GAMLSS results showed that the most suitable performance distribution was LNO distribution and then RGE distribution in the Gorganrood River Basin. On other hand, the GAMLSS model and the Pettitt test have good capability in detecting stationary and nonstationary PDS series.",

In this study, we used Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS) to analyze the nonstationary changes of annual maximum runoff in the HRB and its influencing factors. It has also been complemented with a stationary model for comparative analysis. We found that the annual maximum runoff has a significant decreasing trend. The top four factors influencing this runoff change are the local changes in precipitation and temperature, and the regional climate oscillations as reflected by the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO) and the Pacific North American Index (PNA). The nonstationary model had better simulation effect than the stationary model. The stationary model could not reflect the impact of explanatory variables on annual maximum runoff, while the nonstationary model could well analyze the impact of single and dual explanatory variables.

      "abstract": "Based on the ensemble precipitation forecast data in the summers of 2014–2018 from the Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment (THORPEX) Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE), a comparative study of two multi-model ensemble methods, the Bayesian model average (BMA) and the logistic regression (LR), was conducted. Meanwhile, forecasts of heavy precipitation from the two models over the Wujiang River Basin in China for the summer of 2018 were compared to verify their performances. The training period sensitivity test results show that a training period of 2 years was the best for BMA probability forecast model. Compared with the BMA method, the LR model required more statistical samples and its optimal length of the training period was 5 years. According to the Brier score (BS), for precipitation events exceeding 10 mm with lead times of 1–7 days, the BMA outperformed the LR and the raw ensemble prediction system forecasts (RAW) except for forecasts with a lead time of 1 day. Furthermore, for heavy rainfall events exceeding 25 and 50 mm, the RAW and the BMA performed much the same in terms of prediction. The reliability diagram of the two multi-model ensembles (i.e., BMA and LR) was more reliable than the RAW for heavy and moderate rainfall forecasts, and the BMA model had the best performance. The BMA probabilistic forecast can produce a highly concentrated probability density function (PDF) curve and can also provide deterministic forecasts through analyzing percentile forecast results. With regard to the heavy rainfall forecast in mountainous areas, it is recommended to refer to the forecast with a larger percentile between the 75th and 90th percentiles. Nevertheless, extreme events with low probability forecasts may occur and cannot be ignored.",

In this paper, these forecasts and their skills are evaluated through relevant criteria, particularly by considering forecast performances for different lead times. Furthermore, to enhance their performance, we propose to preprocess the EPS forecasts’ output using bias correction methods. For this aim, forecasts for different ranges of precipitation as well as various climatic conditions are evaluated, which is particularly important for extreme events that can lead to flooding. The Karun River basin in Iran is used as case study, a large area including various climate conditions. The results showed that the performance of European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) forecasts vary with sub-basin properties, e.g., area and skewness of daily precipitation, and vary across dry to humid regions, between flooding and non-flooding seasons, and different lead times and show the effect of different methods for bias correction on the forecast skill. The forecast skill is decreasing from wet regions towards dry regions and the bias correction was more effective in the flooding season, for which the skill was increased by 40% based on continuous ranked probability skill score (CRPSS). When the precipitation thresholds were increased towards extreme values, the forecast performance of ECMWF became better.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, ensemble precipitation forecasting has been able to provide more uncertainty information and plays an increasingly important role in basin-scale hydrologic predictions. The Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) reforecast data released by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) has a long-term data archive and relatively stable systematic error, which shows great potential in hydrologic applications. This paper aims to bias correct the GEFS reforecast precipitation forecasts and analyze the impact of bias-corrected ensemble precipitation forecasts on the improvement of summer streamflow prediction skill. Driven by the GEFS reforecast ensemble precipitation forecasts, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) distributed hydrological model is applied to simulate the 2000–2010 summer streamflow over the Huaihe River basin. The results show that the GEFS reforecast data generally underestimates the precipitation amount with the increasing leadtime and the streamflow simulation tends to underestimate the peak due to the spatial precipitation error. In this study, both the frequency matching method (FMM) and the analog method are applied to calibrate the GEFS reforecast ensemble precipitation forecasts. The searching criteria of the analog method has been improved based on the basin-scale areal precipitation. After bias correction, the FMM method mainly improves the forecast skill of light rain and moderate rain for the 1–8 d leadtime. By contrast, the analog method improves probabilistic precipitation forecasts and increases ensemble spread to alleviate the underdispersion of raw ensemble forecasts for the 1–8 d leadtime. The analog method can also improve spatial distributions with the downscaling information from the observed precipitation, producing better probabilistic precipitation forecasts. The streamflow prediction using bias-corrected precipitation forecasts better resembles the observed streamflow. The analog-corrected precipitation forecasts can effectively improve the streamflow simulations for the 1–5 d leadtime, with the maximum improvements at the 2–3 d leadtime. The FMM method only improves the streamflow predictions for the 2 d leadtime. For the heavy flood events caused by extreme rainstorms in the summer of 2003, the ensemble mean forecasts have limited forecast skill, but probabilistic precipitation forecasts show great potential in predicting the magnitude of extreme rainfall events. Meanwhile, the ensemble streamflow predictions using the analog-corrected precipitation forecasts have larger ensemble spread and a higher Nash coefficient of extreme streamflow. The encouraging results suggest that the reforecast ensemble dataset exhibits a great value to improve hydrometeorological predictions for operational applications.",

      "abstract": "Forecasts of heavy precipitation delivered by atmospheric rivers (ARs) are becoming increasingly important for both flood control and water supply management in reservoirs across California. This study examines the hypothesis that medium-range forecasts of heavy precipitation at the basin scale exhibit recurrent spatial biases that are driven by mesoscale and synoptic-scale features of associated AR events. This hypothesis is tested for heavy precipitation events in the Sacramento River basin using 36 years of NCEP medium-range reforecasts from 1984 to 2019. For each event we cluster precipitation forecast error across western North America for lead times ranging from 1 to 15 days. Integrated vapor transport (IVT), 500-hPa geopotential heights, and landfall characteristics of ARs are composited across clusters and lead times to diagnose the causes of precipitation forecast biases. We investigate the temporal evolution of forecast error to characterize its persistence across lead times, and explore the accuracy of forecasted IVT anomalies across different domains of the North American west coast during heavy precipitation events in the Sacramento basin. Our results identify recurrent spatial patterns of precipitation forecast error consistent with errors of forecasted synoptic-scale features, especially at long (5–15 days) leads. Moreover, we find evidence that forecasts of AR landfalls well outside of the latitudinal bounds of the Sacramento basin precede heavy precipitation events within the basin. These results suggest the potential for using medium-range forecasts of large-scale climate features across the Pacific–North American sector, rather than just local forecasts of basin-scale precipitation, when designing forecast-informed reservoir operations.",

      "abstract": "Recent scientific and computational developments have pushed hydrological forecasting systems up to continental and global scales. In this study, we evaluate the potential skill of ensemble streamflow forecasts for flood prediction in South America (SA), with a closer look on some of the large basins of the continent. Medium-range precipitation forecasts from the ECMWF Ensemble Prediction System were used to force a continental-scale, fully coupled hydrologic-hydrodynamic model to produce streamflow forecasts up to 15 days in advance. Forecasts were evaluated over a 4-year period against a reference simulation, derived from the hydrological model forced with a gridded precipitation dataset that merges data from multiple sources (MSWEP). To provide a benchmark for assessing the potential skill, forecasts based on the Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) technique were produced by running the hydrological model with precipitation data resampled from past MSWEP observations. Overall, ECMWF-based forecasts were skillful mainly at the eastern and southeastern regions of the continent (e.g., São Francisco, Parnaíba, Upper Paraná, Tocantins-Araguaia and Uruguay basins), showing little or no added skill in large rivers draining the Andes such as the Magdalena, Orinoco, Madeira (Amazon) and right-bank tributaries of the Paraguay. In the latter basins, ECMWF-based forecasts largely overestimated the exceedance probabilities of critical thresholds due to a positive bias in the predicted precipitation (in relation to MSWEP), visible mostly during the wet season. In addition, forecasts were found to perform better than ESP in terms of both overall quality and discrimination skill at regions characterized by a warm temperate, fully-humid climate. A direct relation between forecast skill and basin size was not always valid, since the former can vary geographically along tributaries. Limitations and future developments needed for continental-scale hydrological forecasting in SA are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Flood forecasting in urban and semiurban catchments is often limited by the capability of the combined hydrological models and forecast inputs to predict floods accurately. The objective of this research is to develop an approach (1) to identify the best model forecast from multiple integrations of various hydrological models and numerical weather predictions (NWP), and (2) to find the best forecast combination method for an improved short-range flood forecasting. Seven selected hydrological models were coupled, each with two high-resolution NWP forecasts to provide several alternatives of deterministic hydrological forecasts at a catchment outlet. As such, the different model-input combinations were used to generate 14 hydrological forecasts. Hydrological forecast verification was then carried out over a one-year hindcast period. A comparison between six forecast combination methods, including a benchmark Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method, was also performed for the multiple available short-term streamflow forecasts. Results indicate that the coupling of the Sacramento soil moisture accounting (SACSMA) model with both High-Resolution Deterministic Precipitation System and High-Resolution Rapid Refresh inputs outperformed other model-input integrations. Maximum forecast errors in all model-input integration outputs occurred at forecast lead times of , corresponding to the time of concentration of the catchment. Providing constraints on the estimation of model weights was found to be a significant factor for obtaining an improved combined streamflow forecast. In general, the regression-based forecast combination method of the constrained ordinary least squares (CLS) has emerged as a possible alternative to the widely used BMA method for hydrology application.",

      "abstract": "Evaluating the adaptability of precipitation forecasting is of great importance for regional flood control and drought warnings. This study conducted evaluations using the 1–9 days cumulative precipitation forecast data of five typical operational global ensemble prediction systems (EPSs) from TIGGE (i.e., The Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment Interactive Grand Global Ensemble) and the observed daily precipitation data of 40 meteorological stations over the Huaihe River basin (HB). A series of verification metrics is used to evaluate the performances of quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) and probabilistic quantitative precipitation forecasts (PQPFs) from the five EPSs from April to December 2015 in terms of overall performance, different precipitation thresholds, different lead times and the spatial distribution over the HB. The adaptability of the multimodel superensemble integrated from the five EPSs by the Bayesian model average is also examined during the main flood season. The results show that (1) the forecast quality of the China Meteorological Administration EPS is the worst for all lead times, which may relate to its having the fewest ensemble members. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) EPS performs the best in terms of QPF and PQPF qualities for longer lead times because ECMWF has the largest ensemble members. (2) All EPSs have better discrimination at low thresholds, indicating the reference value for drought warnings. ECMWF is expected to obtain the best PQPF skill for a large threshold through postprocessing; (3) due to the differences in climates in the North and South of the basin, QPF and PQPF qualities are better in the northern HB than in the southern HB; (4) except for climate, the PQPF skill is also influenced by precipitation type, while the QPF accuracy is affected by terrain. The PQPF is good at forecasting the precipitation caused by ocean effects but not by mountain topography. The QPF accuracy decreases in mountainous areas; and (5) the multimodel superensemble has little effect on PQPF skill improvement but can improve QPF accuracy when raw EPSs have significantly different QPF accuracies.",

      "abstract": "We evaluated 24-h control forecast products from The International Grand Global Ensemble center over the 10 first-class water resource regions of Mainland China in 2013–18 from the perspective of precipitation processes (continuous) and precipitation events (discrete). We evaluated the forecasts from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), the Centro de Previsão de Tempo e Estudos Climáticos (CPTEC), the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), the United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO), and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). We analyzed the differences among the numerical weather prediction (NWP) models in predicting various types of precipitation events and showed the spatial variations in the quantitative precipitation forecast efficiency of the NWP models over Mainland China. Meanwhile, we also combined four hydrological models to conduct meteo-hydrological runoff forecasting in three typical basins and used the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method to perform the ensemble forecast of different scenarios. Our results showed that the models generally underestimate and overestimate precipitation in northwestern China and southwestern China, respectively. This tendency became increasingly clear as the lead time rose. Each model has a high reliability for the forecast of no-rain and light rain in the next 10 days, whereas the NWP model only has high reliability on the next day for moderate and heavy rain events. In general, each model showed different capabilities of capturing various precipitation events. For example, the CMA and CMC forecasts had a better prediction performance for heavy rain but greater errors for other events. The CPTEC forecast performed well for long lead times for no-rain and light rain but had poor predictability for moderate and heavy rains. The KMA, UKMO, and NCEP forecasts performed better for no-rain and light rain. However, their forecasting ability was average for moderate and heavy rain. Although the JMA model performed better in terms of errors and accuracy, it seriously underestimated heavy rain events. The extreme rainstorm and flood forecast results of the coupled JMA model should be treated with caution. Overall, the ECMWF had the most robust performance. Discrepancies in the forecasting effects of various models on different precipitation events vary with the lead time and region. When coupled with hydrological models, NWP models not only control the accuracy of runoff prediction directly but also increase the difference among the prediction results of different hydrological models with the increase in NWP error significantly. Among all the single models, ECMWF, JMA, and NCEP have better effects than the other models. Moreover, the ensemble forecast based on BMA is more robust than the single model, which can improve the quality of runoff prediction in terms of accuracy and reliability.",

      "abstract": "Study region Australia. Study focus We developed the Seasonally Coherent Calibration (SCC) model to post-process precipitation forecasts from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The SCC model is capable of generating high-quality calibrated forecasts which are coherent in climatology, including seasonality, consistent with observations, despite only a short period of forecasts being available. In this study, we post-process deterministic precipitation forecasts from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator G2 version (ACCESS-G2) NWP model to generate calibrated ensemble forecasts across Australia. We evaluate the effectiveness, robustness, and computational feasibility of forecast post-processing with the SCC model at a high spatial resolution across the continental scale. New hydrological insights for the region Inadequate representation of forecast seasonality in calibration models poses a challenge for the calibration of NWP forecasts. Through this investigation, the statistical assumptions and reparameterization algorithms of the SCC model are confirmed to be effective and robust in addressing the challenge. Calibrated precipitation forecasts could be used to support operational water balance forecasting in Australia. Post-processing of NWP precipitation forecasts with the SCC model will also benefit a broad range of forecast users in Australia by providing accurate, skillful, and reliable ensemble forecasts. Computation strategies adopted in this study will help develop effective procedures for future post-processing of NWP forecasts with sophisticated calibration models at a large spatial scale.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to enhance daily precipitation forecasts over the Indian subcontinent through post-processing the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) outputs using Analog (AN) and Logistic Regression (LR) techniques. Both raw and post-processed GEFS precipitation forecasts were evaluated against the Indian Meteorological Department observed dataset using probabilistic and deterministic forecast evaluation metrics, namely Brier Skill Score (BSS) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), respectively. Results found that the LR and AN post-processing method considerably improved short to medium range (1-7 day) precipitation forecasts over India. A comparison of the techniques with GEFS version 12 (GEFSv12) forecasts across different basins suggests that both methods were able to provide skillful precipitation forecasts in all the river basins, except that the AN method underperformed for the western ghats. The seasonal analysis also showed that the raw and the post-processed forecasts under-performed during the monsoon season while performing comparatively well during the non-monsoon season. The comparison of LR and AN methods showed that LR outperformed the AN method. The forecasts enhanced using both the post-processing techniques were more reliable and skillful than the GEFSv12 precipitation forecast. Comparison of the recent GEFS version with the older version of GEFS showed that the performance of the earlier version was slightly better compared to the latest version, however none of the forecasts can be used for decision making purposes without post-processing.",

      "abstract": "Statistical post-processing techniques are widely used to reduce systematic biases and quantify forecast uncertainty in numerical weather prediction (NWP). In this study, we propose a method to correct the raw daily forecast precipitation by combining large-scale circulation patterns with local spatiotemporal information such as topography and meteorological factors. Particularly, we first use the self-organizing map (SOM) model to classify large-scale circulation patterns for each season, then build the convolutional neural network (CNN) model to extract spatial information (e.g., elevation, specific humidity, and mean sea level pressure) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) model to extract time series (e.g., t, t-1, t-2), and finally correct local precipitation for each circulation pattern separately. Furthermore, the proposed method (SOM-CNN-LSTM) is compared with other benchmark methods (i.e., CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM) in the Huaihe River basin with a lead time of 15 days from 2007 to 2021. The results show that the proposed SOM-CNN-LSTM post-processing method outperforms other benchmark methods for all lead times and each season with the largest correlation coefficient improvement (32.30 %) and root mean square error reduction (26.58 %). Moreover, the proposed method can effectively capture the westward and northward movement of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), which impacts the basin's summer rain. The results illustrate that incorporating large-scale circulation patterns with local spatiotemporal information is a feasible and effective post-processing method to improve forecasting skills, which would benefit hydrological forecasts and other applications.",

      "abstract": "For almost 30 years, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been successfully implemented to address issues around various scientific subjects in the world. On the other hand, it has been reaching to the limit of potential flexibility in further development by the current structure. The new generation SWAT, dubbed SWAT+, was released recently with entirely new coding features. SWAT+ is designed to have far more advanced functions and capacities to handle challenging watershed modeling tasks for hydrologic and water quality processes. However, it is still inevitable to conduct model calibration before the SWAT+ model is applied to engineering projects and research programs. The primary goal of this study is to develop an open-source, easy-to-operate automatic calibration tool for SWAT+, dubbed IPEAT+ (Integrated Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Analysis Tool Plus). There are four major advantages: (i) Open-source code to general users; (ii) compiled and integrated directly with SWAT+ source code as a single executable; (iii) supported by the SWAT developer group; and, (iv) built with efficient optimization technique. The coupling work between IPEAT+ and SWAT+ is fairly simple, which can be conducted by users with minor efforts. IPEAT+ will be regularly updated with the latest SWAT+ revision. If users would like to integrate IPEAT+ with various versions of SWAT+, only few lines in the SWAT+ source code are required to be updated. IPEAT+ is the first automatic calibration tool integrated with SWAT+ source code. Users can take advantage of the tool to pursue more cutting-edge and forward-thinking scientific questions.",

      "abstract": "We present a two-step framework for calibrating complex, many-parameter hydrological models at basin-scale. The framework first calibrates parameters for each catchment/sub-basin sequentially and then fine-tunes parameters as needed.

The visual and quantitative results indicated that our tool produced satisfactory calibration and prediction outcomes for the model’s intended purpose. The comparison experiments demonstrated that the calibration framework and the CLPSO were competent in calibrating large-scale hydrological models. This framework can guarantee spatial coherence, balance objective trade-offs among all catchments, and calibrate many parameters at a low computational cost. By providing better parameter estimates in complex whole-of-basin hydrological models, our calibration tool has the potential to increase the development and application of these models, and thereby improve the management of large river basins.",

      "abstract": "The USEPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is one of the most widely used numerical models to simulate urban runoff and drainage. A typical SWMM project has hundreds or thousands of sub-catchments and more than 20 parameters associated with six different physical processes for each sub-catchment. Consequently, model calibration is a challenging task. In this study, SWMM was integrated with the Optimization Software Tool for Research Involving Computational Heuristics (OSTRICH) to perform single- and multi-objective automatic calibration. The newly developed OSTRICH-SWMM is an open-source tool with dozens of parallelized optimization algorithms. A catchment in Buffalo, NY was selected as a case study and was calibrated according to two competing criteria: (1) minimizing errors in simulated peak flow, and (2) minimizing errors in total flow volume. The Pareto front for the case study was obtained using a multi-objective calibration algorithm and this allowed for evaluating tradeoffs between the peak flow and total volume criteria. The results demonstrate that OSTRICH-SWMM is a promising tool for automatic calibration of SWMM models.",

      "abstract": "Study Area The discharge of the transboundary Komadugu-Yobe Basin, Lake Chad Area, West Africa is calibrated using multi-objective optimization techniques. Study focus The GR5J hydrological model parameters are calibrated using six optimization methods i.e. Local Optimization-Multi Start (LOMS), the Differential Evolution (DE), the Multi-objective Particle the Swarm Optimization (MPSO), the Memetic Algorithm with Local Search Chains (MALS), the Shuffled Complex Evolution-Rosenbrock’s function (SCE-R), and the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. Three combined objective functions i.e. Root Mean Square Error, Nash- Sutcliffe efficiency, Kling-Gupta efficiency are applied. The calibration process is divided into two separate episodes (1974–2000 and 1980–1995) so as to ascertain the robustness of the calibration approaches. Runoff simulation results are analysed with a time-frequency wavelet transform. New hydrological insights for the region For calibration and validation stages, all optimization methods simulate the base flow and high flow spells with a satisfactory level of accuracy. For calibration period, MCMC underestimate it by -0.07 mm/day. The performance evaluation shows that MCMC has the highest values of mean absolute error (0.28) and mean square error (0.40) while LOMS and MCMC record a low volumetric efficiency of 0.56. In all cases, the DE and the SCE-R methods perform better than others. The combination of multi-objective functions and multi-optimization techniques improve the model’s parameters stability and the algorithms’ optimization to represent the runoff in the basin.",

This study conducts a comparison of the above three algorithms with a standard algorithm NSGA-II on a reservoir operation problem to demonstrate their performance in improving the search efficiency and quality of preferred solutions. Under the same calculation times of the objective functions, Pareto optimal solutions of the four algorithms are used in the empirical comparison in terms of the approximation to the preferred solutions. Three performance indicators are then adopted for further comparison. Results show that R-NSGA-II and r-NSGA-II can improve the search efficiency and quality of preferred solutions. The convergence and diversity of their solutions in the concerned region are better than NSGA-II, and the closeness degree to the reference point can be increased by 42.8%, and moreover the number of preferred solutions can be increased by more than 3 times when part of objectives are preferred. By contrast, g-NSGA-II shows worse performance. This study exhibits the performance of three reference point based algorithms and provides insights in algorithm selection for multi-objective reservoir optimization problems.",

      "abstract": "Inter-basin water transfers (IBWT) are implemented to re-allocate unevenly distributed water resources. However, many conflicting objectives associated with society, economy, and environment have made the water resources allocation problem in IBWT more complicated than ever before. Thus, there is a continuous need for in-depth research with the latest optimization techniques to secure many-objective allocation of water resources for IBWT. In addition, being troubled of easily falling into local minima and premature convergence in some multi-objective optimization algorithms, it is necessary to explore new alternatives to improve their search quality. Here we propose a many-objective optimization methodology for IBWT, which includes three modules: (1) formulating a many-objective optimization problem based on realistic controls; (2) developing a new multi-objective real-coded quantum inspired shuffled frog leaping algorithm (r-MQSFLA) to solve the optimization problem; (3) utilizing the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)-Entropy method to filter the Pareto solutions. In r-MQSFLA, the real-coded quantum computer and the external archive with dynamic updating mechanism are applied to SFLA. The performance of r-MQSFLA is first compared to that of other multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) in solving mathematical benchmark problems. A case study of the Eastern Route of South-to-North Water Transfer Project in Jiangsu Province, China varying from a normal to an extremely dry year, demonstrates that r-MQSFLA displays approximate performance on some compared algorithms and is improved significantly than MOSFLA in terms of convergence, diversity and reasonable solutions. This study can update the understanding of quantum theory to MOEAs and will provide a reference for better water resources allocation in IBWT under uncertainty.",

      "abstract": "Creating a reliable groundwater vulnerability map is a key solution for protecting the groundwater resources and further planning in coastal aquifers. The GALDIT framework, which is an abbreviation for six parameters of Groundwater occurrence, Aquifer hydraulic conductivity, Level of groundwater above sea level, Distance from the shoreline, Impact of the existing status of seawater intrusion, and Thickness of the aquifer, is a well-known framework for evaluating the groundwater vulnerability in coastal zones. In this study, two meta -heuristic algorithms of Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) were proposed to optimize the weights of GALDIT framework. This framework was tested in the Gharesoo-Gorgan Rood coastal aquifer located in the north of Iran. The GALDIT index illustrated poor evaluation of vulnerability to seawater intrusion. Contrariwise, GALDIT-GWO and GALDIT-GA frameworks provided results that are more reasonable. Both vulnerability maps showed a close similarity in terms of vulnerability to seawater intrusion. The vulnerability maps demonstrated that the west and northwest parts of the study area suffer from seawater intrusion. Additionally, the values of Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between the indices of GALDIT, GALDIT-GWO and GALDIT-GA and the parameter of Cl/HCO 3 were obtained as 0.31, 0.53, and 0.49 and the corresponding values for the parameter of TDS were obtained 0.45, 0.64 and 0.60, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed optimization models are able to provide accurate results. Furthermore, these models reduce the subjectivity and increase the capability of the GALDIT index.",

Spatially distributed hydrological modeling provides an opportunity to enhance the use of multi-variable calibration models. The objective of this study is to test the efficiency of satellite-based actual evapotranspiration in the HBV hydrological model to render the catchment water balance using multi-variable calibration in the upper Omo-Gibe basin in Ethiopia. Five years (2000–2004) meteorological data, streamflow, and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) based on remote sensing were used for calibration and validation purposes. The performance of the HBV model and the efficiency of SEBS–ETa were evaluated using certain calibration criteria (objective function). The model is first calibrated using only streamflow data to test HBV model performance and then calibrated using a multi-variable (streamflow and ETa) dataset to evaluate the efficiency of SEBS–ETa. Both model setups were validated in a multi-variable evaluation using streamflow and ETa data. In the first case, the model performed well enough for streamflow and poor for ETa, while in the latter case, the performance efficiency of SEBS–ETa and streamflow data shows satisfactory to good. This implies that the performance of hydrological models is enhanced by employing multi-variable calibration.",

      "abstract": "The calibration of hydrological models is often complex in regions with scarce data, and generally only uses site-based streamflow data. However, this approach will yield highly generalised values for all model parameters and hydrological processes. It is therefore necessary to obtain more spatially heterogeneous observation data (e.g., satellite-based evapotranspiration (ET)) to calibrate such hydrological models. Here, soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) models were built to evaluate the advantages of using ET data derived from the Global Land surface Evaporation Amsterdam Methodology (GLEAM) to calibrate the models for the Bayinhe River basin in northwest China, which is a typical data-scarce basin. The result revealed the following: (1) A great effort was required to calibrate the SWAT models for the study area to obtain an improved model performance. (2) The SWAT model performance for simulating the streamflow and water balance was reliable when calibrated with streamflow only, but this method of calibration grouped the hydrological processes together and caused an equifinality issue. (3) The combination of the streamflow and GLEAM-based ET data for calibrating the SWAT model improved the model performance for simulating the streamflow and water balance. However, the equifinality issue remained at the hydrologic response unit (HRU) level.",

The model itself concerns a single problem for which the best possible solution is sought. Problems are usually static in the sense that they do not consider changes over time in a cumulative manner. Dynamic optimisation problems to incorporate changes. However, these are memoryless in that the problem description changes and a new problem is solved - but with little reference to any previous information. In this paper, a temporally augmented version of a water management problem which allows farmers to plan over long time horizons is introduced. A climate change projection model is used to predict both rainfall and temperature for the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area in Australia for up to 50 years into the future. Three representative decades are extracted from the climate change model to create the temporal data sets. The results confirm the utility of the temporal approach and show, for the case study area, that crops that can feasibly and sustainably be grown will be a lot fewer than the present day in the challenging water-reduced conditions of the future.",

      "journal": "Hydrology Research",
      "citations": 9,
      "abstract": "Dynamic contributing areas, various fill-and-spill mechanisms and cold-region processes make the hydrological modelling of the Prairies very challenging. Several models (from simple conceptual to advanced process-based) are available, but the focus has been largely in reproducing streamflow. Few studies have assimilated soil moisture and other hydrological fluxes for improved simulation, but the emphasis has been predominately on simulating contributing areas. However, previous research has shown that the contributing areas are dynamic, and can vary from one year to the next, depending on hydro-meteorological conditions. Therefore, the areas deemed non-contributing can also occasionally contribute to streamflow. In this study, we introduce a progressive two-stage calibration strategy to constrain soil moisture in non-contributing areas. We demonstrate that constraining soil moisture in non-contributing areas can result in improved hydrological simulations and more realistic process representations. The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values for simulated soil moisture in contributing areas increased by 68% at 20 cm and 25% at 50 cm soil depths during validation when non-contributing areas were constrained. This further led to increases in NSE values in streamflow simulation during calibration (6%) and validation (12%). Our findings suggest that soil moisture in non-contributing areas should be properly constrained for improved modelling of Prairie catchments.",

      "citations": 64,
      "abstract": "Multi-modelling aims to make use of the strengths of single hydrologic models to improve the accuracy of simulating the watershed system behavior. Considering hydrological signatures such as the flow duration curve segmentation in the calibration of each hydrologic model leads to a better parameter identifiability. In this study, a novel weighted average model-wrapper based on flow duration curve segmentation is introduced to aggregate the calibrated models into a multi-model. The proposed framework is applied to develop a model-wrapper of the Upper Assiniboine River Basin for flood forecasting upstream of the Shellmouth reservoir in the Prairie region of Canada. The HEC-HMS, HBV-EC, HSPF, and WATFLOOD hydrologic models that are being used at the Hydrologic Forecast Centre of Manitoba Infrastructure for operational inflow forecasting are calibrated using signature-based multi-objective optimization. These models have significantly different structural complexities. The calibration of each of these models is set up as three simulation-optimization problems with different objective functions to balance the model capability in simulating multiple important hydrological signatures. Results show that the model-wrapper outperforms each of the single calibrated models that are of operational use at Manitoba Infrastructure, e.g. NSE improved from 0.44 for the best individual model to 0.76 for the model-wrapper in the calibration period. Moreover, the weights associated with each hydrologic model component indicate the contribution rate of the individual models to the model-wrapper in high-flow, mid-flow, and low-flow portions of streamflow time series. Quantifying the contribution of each model component provides a deeper insight into model selection strategy, especially when a component has minimal or no contribution, e.g. HEC-HMS and HBV-EC in this paper, to the model-wrapper performance in all ranges of streamflow simulation compared to other model components.",

      "citations": 110,
      "abstract": "Twelve actual evaporation datasets are evaluated for their ability to improve the performance of the fully distributed mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM). The datasets consist of satellite-based diagnostic models (MOD16A2, SSEBop, ALEXI, CMRSET, SEBS), satellite-based prognostic models (GLEAM v3.2a, GLEAM v3.3a, GLEAM v3.2b, GLEAM v3.3b), and reanalysis (ERA5, MERRA-2, JRA-55). Four distinct multivariate calibration strategies (basin-average, pixel-wise, spatial bias-accounting and spatial bias-insensitive) using actual evaporation and streamflow are implemented, resulting in 48 scenarios whose results are compared with a benchmark model calibrated solely with streamflow data. A process-diagnostic approach is adopted to evaluate the model responses with in-situ data of streamflow and independent remotely sensed data of soil moisture from ESA-CCI and terrestrial water storage from GRACE. The method is implemented in the Volta River basin, which is a data scarce region in West Africa, for the period from 2003 to 2012. Results show that the evaporation datasets have a good potential for improving model calibration, but this is dependent on the calibration strategy. All the multivariate calibration strategies outperform the streamflow-only calibration. The highest improvement in the overall model performance is obtained with the spatial bias-accounting strategy (+29%), followed by the spatial bias-insensitive strategy (+26%) and the pixel-wise strategy (+24%), while the basin-average strategy (+20%) gives the lowest improvement. On average, using evaporation data in addition to streamflow for model calibration decreases the model performance for streamflow (-7%), which is counterbalance by the increase in the performance of the terrestrial water storage (+11%), temporal dynamics of soil moisture (+6%) and spatial patterns of soil moisture (+89%). In general, the top three best performing evaporation datasets are MERRA-2, GLEAM v3.3a and SSEBop, while the bottom three datasets are MOD16A2, SEBS and ERA5. However, performances of the evaporation products diverge according to model responses and across climatic zones. These findings open up avenues for improving process representation of hydrological models and advancing the spatiotemporal prediction of floods and droughts under climate and land use changes.",

Multi-variable calibration was performed by combining streamflow and remote sensing-derived actual evapotranspiration data. Parameter transferability was also investigated, by daily time step validation. The KGE for the outlet ranged from 0.73 to 0.86, and the average KGE of all streamflow gauge stations ranged from 0.73 to 0.80, reflecting a good overall simulation performance for the monthly time step. In daily time step validation, KGE ranged from 0.62 to 0.68, and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ranged from 0.40 to 0.60, for the average of all gauge stations.

      "citations": 23,
      "abstract": "Hydrological models are widely used tools in water resources management. Their successful application requires an efficient calibration of the model parameters. Nowadays, there are very powerful global search methods applied to this end, but they have the disadvantage of presenting a high computational cost, because the numerical model to be calibrated needs to be evaluated a large number of times with different parameter sets. In this context, surrogate models can reduce significantly the run time of hydrological models, easing the total computational burden of global search methods. In the present work, we propose and explore the combination of a swarm intelligence-based optimization method, the artificial bee colony algorithm, with a surrogate model based on artificial neural networks in order to calibrate hydrological models. The proposed approach (ABC-ANN) is applied to the calibration and validation of a nine-parameter continuous hydrological model in two basins located in the northwest of Spain. Several aspects of the algorithm are evaluated, including its capability to calibrate the model parameters and its efficiency in terms of CPU time compared to a standard implementation of the ABC algorithm. Results show that the ABC-ANN algorithm is able to identify the location of suitable parameter sets with an accuracy rate within 89 and 99 %, and a reduction in CPU time of more than three orders of magnitude when compared to a sequential implementation. In addition, the frequency distribution of the parameter sets identified gives valuable information about the sensitivity of model output to the input parameters.",

Subsequently, the clusters are calibrated independently, as well as simultaneous with multiple objectives. The procedure is illustrated through two models viz. SWAT and a grid based model; set up for the US watersheds Cedar Creek, Indiana and Riesel Y2, Texas respectively. The proposed approach resulted in improved stream flow simulations with higher NSE (0.83 in multi-objective; 0.68 in traditional calibration) in Cedar Creek.

      "citations": 5,
      "abstract": "The process-based hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool ensures the simulation's reliability by calibration. Compared to the commonly applied single-objective calibration, multi-objective calibration benefits the spatial parameterization and the simulation of specific processes. However, the requirements of additional observations and the practical procedure are among the reasons to prevent the wider application of the multi-objective calibration. This study proposes to consider three groups of objectives for the calibration: multisite, multi-objective function, and multi-metric. For the study catchment with limited observations like the Yuan River Catchment (YRC) in China, the three groups corresponded to discharge from three hydrometric stations, both Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and inversed NSE for discharge evaluation, and MODIS global terrestrial evapotranspiration product and baseflow filtered from discharge as metrics, respectively. The applicability of two multi-objective calibration approaches, the Euclidean distance and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II, was analyzed to calibrate the above-mentioned objectives for the YRC. Results show that multi-objective calibration has simultaneously ensured the model's better performance in terms of the spatial parameterization, the magnitude of the output time series, and the water balance components, and it also reduces the parameter and prediction uncertainty. The study thus leads to a generalized, recommended procedure for catchments with data scarcity to perform the multi-objective calibration.",

Two multi-objective model calibration strategies were formulated to achieve a balanced representation of ecologically relevant hydrologic indices. Two approaches were employed: 1) a performance-based method constraining the targeted hydrologic indices and 2) an unconstrained signature-based method explicitly incorporating the targeted hydrologic indices into multiple objective functions. Both strategies were successful in representing most of the selected hydrologic indices within a ±30% relative error acceptability threshold while yielding consistent runoff predictions in a watershed. The performance-based strategy was preferred since it showed a lower dispersion of near-optimal Pareto solutions when representing the selected indices based on water balance and Flow Duration Curve characteristics. Still, the overall representation of low flow magnitude and timing, rise and fall rates, and duration and frequency of extreme flows was limited in terms of interannual variability due to the hydrological model structural inadequacies.",

      "citations": 14,
      "abstract": "In hydrological modelling, traditionally one calibration was performed over a certain calibration period before the model is used to study the hydrological system. This implies that a constant model structure and parameterization are assumed. However, if the catchment system is subject to changes that are not incorporated in the model, the parameter values found in a calibration period may not be optimal for other periods, which is called systemic change. The aim of this study was to identify systemic change and its possible causes with the PCR-GLOBWB hydrological model in the Rhine-Meuse basin, by performing a brute-force calibration for multiple periods for five calibration locations between 1901-2010. Systemic change was studied for the main model components, by selecting a key parameter from each component (minimum soil depth fraction, saturated hydraulic conductivity, groundwater recession coefficient, degree day factor, Manning's n). These parameters were calibrated for 10-year rolling periods between 1901-2010. The results showed that at the downstream locations, the changes in optimal parameter values were small, while at the upstream locations, the optimal values of most parameters changed considerably over the different rolling calibration periods, signifying systemic change. Especially the degree day factor showed large variations, varying over time between 0.5 and 2.5 times its default value at Basel and Maxau (upstream and middle part of the Rhine basin). Based on correlation analysis, it was found that climate change as well as changes in land use and river structure are possible causes of changes in optimal parameter values through time.",

A challenge associated with the use of these models is the computational burden associated with representing the Earth's (sub) surface via millions of computational elements. This burden is exacerbated as more complex process representations are included because their parameterizations involve computationally intensive mathematical functions. Lookup tables (LUTs) approximate a mathematical function by interpolating precomputed values of the function. Highly accurate approximations are possible for substantially reduced computational costs. In this work, a general methodology using the C++ LUT library FunC is applied to identify and replace computationally intensive mathematical function evaluations in the Canadian Hydrological Model (CHM). The use of LUTs introduces a pointwise relative error below 10− 8 and provides a reduction in run time of almost 20%. This work shows how LUTs can be implemented with relatively little pain and yield significant computational savings for distributed hydrological models.",

      "abstract": "This study explored how the characterization of forest processes in hydrologic models affects watershed hydrological responses. To that end, we applied the widely used Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to two forested watersheds in the southeastern United States. Although forests can cover a large portion of watersheds, tree attributes such as leaf area index (LAI), biomass accumulation, and processes such as evapotranspiration (ET) are rarely calibrated in hydrological modeling studies. The advent of freely and readily available remote-sensing data, combined with field observations from forestry studies and published literature, allowed us to develop an improved forest parameterization for SWAT. We tested our proposed parameterization at the watershed scale in Florida and Georgia and compared simulated LAI, biomass, and ET with the default model settings. Our results showed major improvements in predicted monthly LAI and ET based on MODIS reference data ( NSE > 0.6). Simulated forest biomass also showed better agreement with the USDA forest biomass gridded data. Through a series of modeling experiments, we isolated the benefits of LAI, biomass, and ET in predicting streamflow and baseflow at the watershed level. The combined benefits of improved LAI, biomass, and ET predictions yielded the most optimal model configuration where terrestrial and in-stream processes were simulated reasonably well. We performed automated model calibration using two calibration strategies. In the first calibration scheme (M 0 ), SWAT was calibrated for daily streamflow without adjusting LAI, biomass, and ET. In the second calibration scheme (M LAI+BM+ET ), previously calibrated parameters constraining LAI, biomass, and ET were incorporated into the model and daily streamflow was recalibrated. The M LAI+BM+ET model showed superior performance and reduced uncertainties in predicting daily streamflow, with NSE values ranging from 0.52 to 0.8. Our findings highlight the importance of accurately representing forest dynamics in hydrological models.",

      "abstract": "In large‐scale watersheds, only the calibration of parameters for the outlet may ignore spatial heterogeneity and fail to meet the simulation accuracy of local areas. Based on the runoff observation data of three hydrological stations (Qingyang, Yangjiaping and Zhangjiashan) in the Jinghe River Watershed, single‐ and multi‐site calibration strategies were designed to investigate the performance and applicability of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in predicting the monthly runoff of nested catchments and evaluate the differences in parameter sensitivity between the upstream and downstream. (i) The two calibration strategies showed little difference in the simulation accuracy of the watershed outlet; the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and determination coefficient (R 2 ) were approximately 0.8 and 0.6, respectively, and the percentage of bias (PBIAS) was mostly 0.5 in combination with the other two sites. (ii) The sensitive parameters obtained by the two calibration strategies were different, and different parameters were effective for different‐sized catchments because hydrological processes exhibit astounding variability at all scales. The single‐site one‐by‐one calibration was mainly affected by the hydrological processes of the local catchment, whereas the multi‐site joint calibration was largely constrained by the sensitive parameters of the single‐site calibration. (iii) Parameters at different scales and locations were related to the problem of scaling and regionalization. The multi‐site joint calibration did not significantly improve the model performance of the watershed outlet but increased the capacity for synchronous identification of local sensitive parameters when compared to single‐site calibration. These findings are expected to provide experience for parameter calibration in other similar large‐scale watersheds and to lay a good foundation for the accurate identification of other related hydrological behaviours at watershed scales.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Research",

      "abstract": "Estimating spatially distributed parameters remains one of the biggest challenges for large‐domain hydrologic modeling. Many large‐domain modeling efforts rely on spatially inconsistent parameter fields, e.g., patchwork patterns resulting from individual basin calibrations, parameter fields generated through default transfer functions that relate geophysical attributes to model parameters, or spatially constant, default parameter values. This paper provides an initial assessment of a multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR) method over large geographical domains to derive seamless parameters in a spatially consistent manner. MPR applies transfer functions at the native scale of the geophysical data, and then scales these model parameters to the desired model resolution. We developed a stand‐alone framework called MPR‐flex for multimodel use and applied MPR‐flex to the variable infiltration capacity model to produce hydrologic simulations over the contiguous United States (CONUS). We first independently calibrate 531 basins across CONUS to obtain a performance benchmark for each basin. To derive the CONUS parameter fields, we perform a joint MPR calibration using all but the poorest behaved basins to obtain a single set of transfer function parameters that are applied to the entire CONUS. Results show that CONUS‐wide calibration has similar performance compared to previous simulations using a patchwork quilt of partially calibrated parameter sets, but without the spatial discontinuities in parameters that characterize some previous CONUS‐domain model simulations. Several avenues to improve CONUS‐wide calibration remain, including selection of calibration basins, objective function formulation, as well as MPR‐flex improvements including transfer function formulations and scaling operator optimization.",

The present work assesses the capabilities of a PDHM, SHETRAN in capturing streamflow and depth to groundwater table to represent the hydrologic processes within a wet tropical humid catchment. The most significant model parameters for the coupled simulations of streamflow and groundwater table depths are assessed through a multiobjective sensitivity analysis using Morris screening method and local sensitivity analysis. Horizontal and vertical soil saturated hydraulic conductivities, specific storage, as well as Actual/Potential evapotranspiration and Strickler overland coefficient, are highly sensitive for both the model responses considered. In order to arrive at the optimal model parameters for simulating depth to water table and streamflow, the effect of three model parametrization approaches were analyzed: with no spatial variation in soil properties, elevation based variation of only middle and bottom soil layer saturated hydraulic conductivity and elevation based variation of horizontal (kx), vertical (kz) soil saturated hydraulic conductivities and specific storage (Ss). Results indicate that for the studied watershed, the elevation based variation in kx, kz, and Ss resulted in a better prediction of depth to water table variations (in terms of correlation coefficient) with no significant improvements in streamflow simulation compared to the other two parameterization cases. The study suggests incorporating preferential flows in SHETRAN model to improve prediction of the water table dynamics in catchments belonging to the humid tropical region.",

Study focus The Prairie region spans across approximately 870,000 km 2 of the Great Plains region of Canada (80%) and the United States (20%). The presence of a large number of depressional wetlands (potholes) results in dynamic surface-water and stream connectivity during wet and dry year necessitating an improved understanding of watershed-scale interactions of the Prairie Potholes. The Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model with three structural variants is utilized to assess the degree of accuracy associated with increasing model complexity and its impact on the model calibration of the Upper Assiniboine River Basin at Kamsack. New hydrologic insight for the region The SWAT model was calibrated and verified with three different structural arrangements in 1) lumped pothole, 2) semi discretized pothole, 3) and fully discretized pothole representation. The fully discretized pothole version of the SWAT reflected streamflow best (KGE of 0.78) but with greater uncertainty, larger data and computational resource requirements. The fully discretized (modified) model, however, was able to capture the high flow and the fill-and-spill processes, which is a defining characteristic of the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR). Significant improvements to the predictive ability of SWAT in the case of the modified model was observed, thus allowing an enhanced understanding of the aggregate effect of potholes in this watershed.",

      "abstract": "Regionalized lumped rainfall-runoff (RR) models have been widely employed as a means of predicting the streamflow of an ungauged watershed because of their simple yet effective simulation strategies. Parameter regionalization techniques relate the parameter values of a model calibrated to the observations of gauged watersheds to the geohydrological characteristics of the watersheds. Thus, the accuracy of regionalized models is dependent on the calibration processes, as well as the structure of the model used and the quality of the measurements. In this study, we have discussed the potentials and limitations of hydrological model parameter regionalization to provide practical guidance for hydrological modeling of ungauged watersheds. This study used a Tank model as an example model and calibrated its parameters to streamflow observed at the outlets of 39 gauged watersheds. Multiple regression analysis identified the statistical relationships between calibrated parameter values and nine watershed characteristics. The newly developed regional models provided acceptable accuracy in predicting streamflow, demonstrating the potential of the parameter regionalization method. However, uncertainty associated with parameter calibration processes was found to be large enough to affect the accuracy of regionalization. This study demonstrated the importance of objective function selection of the RR model regionalization.",

      "abstract": "This study presents diagnostic evaluation of two large‐domain hydrologic models: the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM) and the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) over the contiguous United States (CONUS). These models have been calibrated using the Multiscale Parameter Regionalization scheme in a joint, multibasin approach using 492 medium‐sized basins across the CONUS yielding spatially distributed model parameter sets. The mHM simulations are used as a performance benchmark to examine performance deficiencies in the VIC model. We find that after calibration to streamflow, VIC generally overestimates the magnitude and temporal variability of evapotranspiration (ET) as compared to mHM as well as the FLUXNET observation‐based ET product, resulting in underestimation of the mean and variability of runoff. We perform a controlled calibration experiment to investigate the effect of varying number of transfer function parameters in mHM and to enable a fair comparison between both models (14 and 48 for mHM vs. 14 for VIC). Results of this experiment show similar behavior of mHM with 14 and 48 parameters. Furthermore, we diagnose the internal functioning of the VIC model by looking at the relationship of the evaporative fraction versus the degree of soil saturation and compare it with that of the mHM model, which has a different model structure, a prescribed nonlinear relationship between these variables and exhibits better model skill than VIC. Despite these limitations, the VIC‐based CONUS‐wide calibration constrained against streamflow exhibits better ET skill as compared to two preexisting independent VIC studies.",

      "abstract": "Hydrological models have been widely used to predict runoff in regions with observed discharge data, and regionalization methods have been extensively discussed for providing runoff predictions in ungauged basins (PUB), especially during the PUB decade (2003–2012). Great progress has been achieved in the field of regionalization in previous studies, in which different hydrological models have been coupled with various regionalization methods. However, different conclusions have been drawn due to the use of different hydrological models, regionalization methods, and study regions. In this study, we assessed the performance of the five most widely used regionalization methods (spatial proximity with parameter averaging option (SP-par), spatial proximity with output averaging option (SP-out), physical similarity with parameter averaging option (Phy-par), physical similarity with output averaging option (Phy-out), and regression methods (PCR)) and four daily rainfall-runoff models (GR4J, WASMOD, HBV and XAJ, with 6, 8, 13, and 17 parameters, respectively) at the same time. Our aim was to evaluate how the performance of the regionalization methods depends on (a) the selection of hydrological models, (b) nonstationary climate conditions, and (c) different climatic regions. This investigation used data from 86 independent catchments evenly distributed throughout Norway, covering three different climate zones (oceanic, continental and polar tundra) according to the Köppen-Geiger classification. The results showed that (a) the SP-out and Phy-out methods performed better than the SP-par and Phy-par for all the hydrological models, and the regression method performed worst in most cases; (b) the difference between the parameter averaging option and the output averaging option is positively related to the number of hydrological model parameters, i.e. the greater the number of parameters, the larger the difference between the two options; (c) the XAJ model with the greatest number of parameters produced the best results in most cases, and models with fewer parameters tend to produce similar performance for the different regionalization methods; (d) models with more parameters displayed larger declines in performance than those with fewer parameters for nonstationary conditions; and (e) clear differences in the performance of the regionalization methods exist among the three climatic regions. This study provides insight into the relationship between the complexity of hydrological models and regionalization methods in cold and seasonally snow-covered regions.",

      "abstract": "One major challenge in large scale modeling is the estimation of spatially consistent distributed parameters, that are parameters with a clear functional relationship to climate and landscape characteristics. We present a newly developed PArameter Set Shuffling (PASS) approach, which is able to provide such regionally consistent parameter sets. The PASS method does not require any a priori assumption on the relationship between model parameters and catchment descriptors. It instead derives these relationships from observed patterns of calibrated parameters and available catchment descriptors. We tested the PASS approach to derive parameters of a conceptual hydrological model applied to 263 German catchments. The resulting median model efficiencies for training and test catchments are, respectively, 0.74 and 0.72, similar to those obtained by other modeling approaches, which use regional calibration. In this study, a combination of catchment descriptors that clearly controls model parameters is not found. In fact, we show that various regional functional relationships between catchment descriptors and model parameters result in similarly good model performances. Moreover, catchment descriptors used for parameter prediction can be replaced in the parameter prediction, without any decrease in model performance. Our results suggest that by using conventional catchment descriptors based on averages, only the amount of information that is also retained in the existing correlations among climatic and catchment indicators is exploited. Development of a new generation of hydrologically meaningful catchment and climate descriptors is required to further improve our capability of forecasting hydrological dynamics of interest by means of large scale models and regionalization approaches.",

The results indicate that the parameters from a coarse resolution model that can reasonably capture the spatial heterogeneity of the watershed, can be used to simulate a fine resolution model with satisfactory performance (NSE > 0.60 in both watersheds). The models with transferred parameters did preserve sufficient watershed heterogeneity to still provide acceptable prediction, with performance resulting in an NSE > 0.6 and NSE > 0.90 for both stream flow and water quality variables respectively at a location upstream. The parameter transfer approach can be used with lesser computational effort along with good simulation accuracy, if the spatial heterogeneity of the watershed is preserved at the coarse resolution.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 24,
      "abstract": "Development of robust hydrologic-hydrodynamic simulation models is challenging, especially in regions, where in-situ observation data are scarce. Parameter calibration is often a necessary and data-demanding step. Moreover, good calibration performance does not guarantee predictive skill in neighboring geographic regions or new time periods and scenarios. A robust calibration strategy is necessary and must apply an informed parameter regionalization approach, which can transfer parameter values from gauged to ungauged subcatchments, whilst accounting for data availability and quality. In this study, a calibration strategy combining a parameter transfer framework based on catchment similarities with a holistic calibration against hydrological signatures is presented to obtain reliable simulations at all relevant locations within a catchment. The approach is demonstrated for three African river catchments: the Tana, the Upper Niger and the Semliki catchments. A rainfall-runoff model based on Budyko’s concept of limits with up to 11 calibration parameters and a daily simulation time step is used, coupled with a Muskingum routing scheme. Each river catchment is subdivided into so-called hydrological response units (HRU) based on climatic and physiographic characteristics. Multi-mission satellite remote sensing observations are used for the HRU classification: terrain slope derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and the publicly available European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) land cover map. Subcatchments within each HRU share the same parameters. The number of units is constrained by the number of in-situ stations available. The calibration strategy is a catchment-scale, multi-objective approach. The method improved the overall model performance compared to a simpler, nearest-neighbor regionalization method. In particular, spatial patterns of the hydrological response are more reasonable and performance is improved at validation stations, highlighting the importance of appropriate parameter regionalization within nested catchments. With this method, a wider range of currently available remote sensing data (elevation, precipitation, land cover, etc.) can be exploited in hydrological model development and calibration.",

      "citations": 104,
      "abstract": "All hydrological models need to be calibrated to obtain satisfactory streamflow simulations. Here we present a novel parameter regionalization approach that involves the optimization of transfer equations linking model parameters to climate and landscape characteristics. The optimization was performed in a fully spatially distributed fashion at high resolution (0.05°), instead of at lumped catchment scale, using an unprecedented database of daily observed streamflow from 4,229 headwater catchments (<5,000 km2) worldwide. The optimized equations were subsequently applied globally to produce parameter maps for the entire land surface including ungauged regions. The approach was evaluated using the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) and a gridded version of the hydrological model HBV. Tenfold cross validation was used to evaluate the generalizability of the approach and to obtain an ensemble of parameter maps. For the 4,229 independent validation catchments, the regionalized parameters yielded a median KGE of 0.46. The median KGE improvement (relative to uncalibrated parameters) was 0.29, and improvements were obtained for 88% of the independent validation catchments. These scores compare favorably to those from previous large catchment sample studies. The degree of performance improvement due to the regionalized parameters did not depend on climate or topography. Substantial improvements were obtained even for independent validation catchments located far from the catchments used for optimization, underscoring the value of the derived parameters for poorly gauged regions. The regionalized parameters-available via www.gloh2o.org/hbv-should be useful for hydrological applications requiring accurate streamflow simulations.",

To address this issue, the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) was used as a case study. Measured daily runoff data over a 60-year period from the Zhutuo, Beibei, and Wulong Hydrological Stations were used. A stochastic model of inflow floods for the TGR was established using the periodic stationary autoregressive method, which generated 4,000 stochastic inflow floods. A dynamic capacity flood regulation capacity model was used to simulate different inflow floods (the stochastic floods and the measured flood for 1954. The results were based on the 1,000-year flood, which was enlarged by the stochastic floods. The results show that, under the most dangerous inflow flood conditions, the maximum discharge at the Zhicheng Hydrological Station was 75,550 m 3 /s, which is 7,850 m 3 /s greater than the maximum discharge at Zhicheng for the 1954 flood. The results also showed that the probability of a more dangerous inflow flood than the 1954 flood occurring is 6.63%. This shows that it is not sufficient to calculate the flood control ability of river-type reservoirs using only historical flood measurements. In flood control design, it is necessary to use stochastic flood simulation methods to find the most dangerous inflow flood process of a reservoir at a specific design frequency, and to simulate the propagation of the flood in the reservoir through dynamic capacity flood regulation. These methods enable the flood control ability of large river-type reservoirs to be demonstrated.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Research",
      "citations": 61,
      "abstract": "Nowadays, most of rivers globally are regulated by dams and reservoirs, which have substantially altered natural streamflow regimes. Understanding the impacts of these dams and reservoirs on streamflow is essential for water resources management. In situ reservoir release data or actual reservoir operating rules are difficult to obtain, particularly for transboundary rivers, resulting in the tremendous difficulty of simulating exact reservoir behaviors. This study aims to use easy‐to‐obtain satellite observations combined with a distributed hydrological model to estimate reservoir releases at the daily time scale. The developed Satellite‐Based Reservoir routing Scheme (SBRS) was applied to two individual reservoirs in the United States and Thailand and cascade reservoirs on the Lancang River in China. The normalized root‐mean‐square error ( NRMSE ), correlation coefficient ( CC ), and hydrographs of daily regulated streamflow simulations were used to assess the performance of the reservoir release simulations. The SBRS was compared with four other global reservoir operation schemes and showed better overall performance with higher CC and lower NRMSE . In addition, the SBRS performed better for the individual reservoirs ( CC > 0.6, NRMSE < 0.2) than the cascade reservoirs, which is attributed to the uncertainty in the simulation of inflow and reservoir storage changes and to the lack of remote sensing data for all the cascade reservoirs. This study explores the potential of satellite observations combined with hydrological modeling in elucidating reservoir behaviors in ungauged and/or transboundary river basins. A better understanding of reservoir behaviors serves as a basis for water resources management and provides a more cooperative environment for all stakeholders of a basin.",

      "citations": 25,
      "abstract": "Human activities have a strong influence on the hydrological cycle altering natural patterns of evapotranspiration, soil infiltration capacity, ice cover, groundwater distribution, and, ultimately, streamflow at different spatio-temporal scales. Yet, modelling human activities and the associated impacts are often given a secondary importance in hydrological models with respect to the high-fidelity characterization of natural processes, especially at the catchment scale. While this has little or no influence on model accuracy when modelling pristine watersheds, it remarkably deteriorates the model performance in river basins with a considerable anthropogenic footprint. Operations of water infrastructures within a watershed, e.g., a dam or a diversion dam, are commonly modelled based on observational data, when available. This reproduces to some extent the historical decisions, but might be inadequate to simulate operations outside of historical climate or socio-economic conditions. In this paper, we compare a descriptive approach traditionally adopted in hydrological models, where reservoir operations are determined by tracking the historical average release, and a normative approach, where the operations are dynamically conditioned upon the reservoir storage and can adapt to the climate and socio-economic conditions influencing the reservoir operations. We contrast these two approaches by assessing the reservoir dynamics and the impacts on the downstream river system across time scales, from daily to seasonal. We first discuss the accuracy of the two approaches in reproducing historical observations. Then, we explore their potential in anticipating the impacts of future reservoir operations when considering climate and socio-economic change scenarios, thus testing the approaches in decision making contexts increasingly altered with respect to the historical one. We critically present the advantages and disadvantages of either approach, thus contributing to clarify the importance of adopting an appropriate approach to model reservoir operations when reconstructing past dynamics or anticipating future dynamics of catchments impacted by human activities.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 12,
      "abstract": "Clearly, water conservancy projects are advantageous for human beings; however, they significantly change the streamflow variability of rivers. This change is a result of the complex and non-linear interactions between natural processes and human activities. Thus far, our understanding of these interactions is still inadequate. In this study, these interactions were evaluated for a large river basin (i.e. the Pearl River basin) with numerous reservoirs to identify reservoir operation scenarios for mitigating drought and flood impacts. To this end, first, the flow variability pattern was derived based on the concept of the admissible range of flow variability. Second, the moving average over shifting horizon method was used to evaluate the effects of the reservoirs on the streamflow variability. Finally, the network theory and data mining technology were applied to establish the streamflow relations between the upstream and downstream reservoirs. The results show that the cascade reservoirs reshape the streamflow variability patterns of the Pearl River in time and space and have a cumulative effect on the downstream runoff. The constructed networks and the identified operation scenarios present that this effect is mainly influenced by the upstream critical reservoirs having different inflows and storage capacities. This suggests the varied roles of the reservoirs for drought mitigation and flood control limiting the formulation and application of integrated operating strategies for the multi-reservoir system.",

      "abstract": "Determining beneficial operation rules for complex reservoir cascades is challenging due to the variability of river inflows, multiple water users, and the computational burden imposed by optimization calculations. Water managers of Sri Lanka face the challenge of balancing water releases for hydropower and for irrigated agriculture in the Mahaweli project. This study derived Mahaweli reservoir operation policies—reservoir rule curves and water allocation rules—by optimizing hydropower generation and agricultural yield. We derived operation rules for three reservoirs and one water diversion structure, because these offer the main opportunities for controllability of hydropower and irrigation. We used a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to optimize hydropower and agriculture yields for 1,000 synthetically generated reservoir inflows that capture the natural variability of the monsoon seasons. The optimization problem was simplified by focusing on the main components of the cascade and by carrying out the computation in two stages. Despite the simplification, the operation rules derived using multiobjective optimization enhanced hydropower and agriculture yield compared with the values from current rules. The solution set exposed the trade-off between energy and agricultural yield objectives. Risk-neutral and risk-averse optimized rules and trade-offs between the objectives provide information that can be used to adapt water management practices for different hydrological conditions, which can be beneficial to thousands of people. Water managers of similar reservoir cascades can use the method to select policies considering trade-offs among objectives.",

      "abstract": "Negligence of environmental flow (e-flow) has severe adverse impacts on wetlands. Additionally, hydrological droughts, compounded by mismanagement of available water resources and anthropogenic activities, lead to water shortage and degrade wetland ecosystem. However, in dealing with reservoir operation/re-operation, a few studies have addressed inflow uncertainty and hydrological drought state to improve the monthly operation performance of an upstream reservoir in coordination with downstream wetland needs. Hence, the study objective is to adopt a linear/nonlinear reservoir operation rule to hydrological drought states and e-flow requirements. So, first, the soil and water assessment (SWAT) model is applied to simulate the natural daily flow regime by eliminating human impacts. Then, using the Tennant e-flow scheme, the intra/inter-annual variability of e-flow and the degree of alteration of the flow are measured. Afterward, using the Standardized Hydrological Drought Index (SHDI), the drought/wet severity and duration are determined. A linear/nonlinear simulation model adopted for the presentation of reservoir policies and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was employed to determine the optimal monthly operation of the upstream reservoir. The simulated operation policies correspond to each hydrological drought state were evaluated with reliability, resilience, vulnerability, and water-deficit indices. Results indicated that incorporation of hydrological drought state could improve the overall system reliability by 23% over simply enforcing the monthly variable-parameter nonlinear decision rules. Also, the proposed methodology simultaneously maximized the downstream allocated water and e-flow of the terminal wetland. It also implicitly minimized the change in extreme flow metrics that are known to benefit ecosystem diversity. The proposed framework supports reservoir re-operation in regions subject to challenges in supplying water to different sectors while maintaining e-flow during drought periods.",

Currently, most researches on reservoir operation model considering downstream ecology just quantify single ecological objective, which is difficult to reflect the downstream ecological demands comprehensively. To address the challenges above, this paper divides the parameters in Indicators of Hydrological Alteration (IHA), a widely used tool reflecting flow regime from multiple perspectives but seldom applied to guide practice reservoir operation, into two categories to reflect ecological demands of water quantity and fluctuation respectively. Then, two ecological objectives of Water Quantity Level (WQL) and Hydrological Alteration (HA) are defined to be incorporated into reservoir operation model with the economic objective of Hydropower Production (HP) for generating optimal operation strategy coordinating economic and ecological benefits. The case study of a typical reservoir in Hunan Province, China shows that: 1) two ecological objectives defined can reflect the alteration of hydrological regime from the perspective of water quantity and fluctuation accurately; and 2) compared with historical operation strategy and optimal operation strategies in the other two scenarios, the optimal operation strategy in scenario C is proved an excellent strategy to guide operation practice reconciling the economic benefits of hydropower plant with the ecological benefits of downstream river, which can balance two objectives of WQL and HA well with high level HP and make the released flow maintain more regime of natural flow.",

      "abstract": "The current situation in the Lancang–Mekong River Basin is emblematic of the issues faced by many transboundary basins around the world: riparian countries prioritize national water-energy policies and provide limited information on how major infrastructures are operated. In turn, such infrastructures and their management become a source of controversy. Here, we turn our attention to the Upper Mekong River, or Lancang, where a system of eleven mainstream dams controls about 55 % of the annual flow to Northern Thailand and Laos. Yet, assessing their actual impact is a challenging task because of the chronic lack of data on reservoir storage and dam release decisions. To overcome this challenge, we focus on the ten largest reservoirs and leverage satellite observations to infer 13-year time series of monthly storage variations. Specifically, we use area-storage curves (derived from a Digital Elevation Model) and time series of water surface area, which we estimate from Landsat images through a novel algorithm that removes the effects of clouds and other disturbances. We also use satellite radar altimetry data (Jason) to validate the results obtained from satellite imagery. Our results describe the evolution of the hydropower system and highlight the pivotal role played by Xiaowan and Nuozhadu reservoirs, which make up to ~85 % of the total system's storage in the Lancang River Basin. We show that these two reservoirs were filled in only two years, and that their operations did not change in response to the drought that occurred in the region in 2019–2020. Deciphering these operating strategies could help enrich existing monitoring tools and hydrological models, thereby supporting riparian countries in the design of more cooperative water-energy policies.",

      "citations": 106,
      "abstract": "Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis (UA/SA) aid in assessing whether model complexity is warranted and under what conditions. To support these analyses a variety of software tools have been developed to provide UA/SA methods and approaches in a more accessible manner. This paper applies a hybrid bibliometric approach using 11 625 publications sourced from the Web of Science database to identify software packages for UA/SA used within the environmental sciences and to synthesize evidence of general research trends and directions. Use of local sensitivity approaches was determined to be prevalent, although adoption of global sensitivity analysis approaches is increasing. We find that interest in uncertainty management is also increasing, particularly in improving the reliability and effectiveness of UA/SA. Although available software is typically open-source and freely available, uptake of software tools is apparently slow or their use is otherwise under-reported. Longevity is also an issue, with many of the identified software appearing to be unmaintained. Improving the general usability and accessibility of UA/SA tools may help to increase software longevity and the awareness and adoption of purpose-appropriate methods. Usability should be improved so as to lower the \"cost of adoption\" of incorporating the software in the modelling workflow. An overview of available software is provided to aid modelers in choosing an appropriate software tool for their purposes.

      "journal": "Hydrological Sciences Journal",
      "citations": 46,
      "abstract": "Over the past few decades, several naturalization methods have been developed for removing anthropogenic influences from streamflow time series, to the point that naturalized flows are often considered true natural flows in many studies. However, such trust in a particular naturalization method does not expose the assumptions underlying the method, nor does it quantifies the associated uncertainty. This review provides an overview of streamflow naturalization approaches. The terminology associated with naturalization is discussed, and a classification of naturalization methods according to their data requirements and main assumptions is proposed. A large set of studies developing or applying naturalization methods are reviewed, and the main challenges associated with the methods applied are assessed. To give a more concrete example, a focus is made on studies conducted in France over the last decade, which applied naturalization methods to estimate water extraction limits in rivers.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Research",
      "citations": 106,
      "abstract": "The state of the art for optimal water reservoir operations is rapidly evolving, driven by emerging societal challenges. Changing values for balancing environmental resources, multisectoral human system pressures, and more frequent climate extremes are increasing the complexity of operational decision making. Today, reservoir operations benefit from technological advances, including improved monitoring and forecasting systems as well as increasing computational power. Past research in this area has largely focused on improving solution algorithms within the limits of the available computational power, using simplified problem formulations that can misrepresent important systemic complexities and intersectoral interactions. In this study, we review the recent literature focusing on how the operation design problem is formulated, rather than solved, to address existing challenges and take advantage of new opportunities. This paper contributes a comprehensive classification of over 300 studies published over the last years into distinctive categories depending on the adopted problem formulation, which clarifies consolidated methodological approaches and emerging trends. Our analysis also suggests that control policy design methods may benefit from broadening the types of information that is used to condition operational decisions, and from using emulation modeling to identify low‐order, computationally efficient surrogate models capturing realistic representations of river basin systems' complexity in order to isolate key decision‐relevant processes. These advances in reservoir operations hold significant promise for better addressing the challenges of conflicting human pressures and a changing world, which is particularly important, given the renewed interest in dam construction globally.",

      "abstract": "The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) is the most widely used global soil erosion model. The poor performance of the RUSLE is solely dependent on the inherent structure of the RUSLE model to account for the soil erosion phenomena under varying topographic and climatic conditions. Considering the extensive global application of the RUSLE model, it is high time in research to identify the suitability of the RUSLE model under varying conditions. In this context, a global-scale review of the RUSLE model application was carried out to identify the best possible conditions for its reliable application and the conditions where it yielded poor performance. RUSLE is still the most frequently operational erosion simulation model despite its numerous deficiencies, weaknesses, and limitations. Nevertheless, the application over large and ungauged areas remains a real challenge due to the non-availability and quality of the required inputs.",

Drought is a complex, devastating natural disaster for which it is challenging to develop effective prediction models. Therefore, our review focuses on basic information about machine learning methods (MLMs) and their potential applications in developing efficient and effective drought forecasting models. We observed that MLMs have achieved significant advances in the robustness, effectiveness, and accuracy of the algorithms for drought modelling in recent years. The performance comparison of MLMs with other models provides a comprehensive conception of different model evaluation metrics. Further challenges of MLMs, such as inadequate training data sets, noise, outliers, and observation bias for spatial data sets, are explored. Finally, our review conveys in-depth understanding to researchers on machine learning applications in forecasting and modeling and provides drought mitigation strategy guidance for policymakers.",

      "journal": "Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Water",
      "citations": 76,
      "abstract": "A warming climate is associated with increasing hydroclimatic extremes, which are often interconnected through complex processes, prompting their concurrence and/or succession, and causing compound extreme events. It is critical to analyze the risks of compound events, given their disproportionately high adverse impacts. To account for the variability in two or more hydroclimatic variables (e.g., temperature and precipitation) and their dependence, a rising number of publications focuses on multivariate analysis, among which the notion of copula-based probability distribution has attracted tremendous interest. Copula is a mathematical function that expresses the joint cumulative probability distribution of multiple variables. Our focus is to re-emphasize the fundamental requirements and limitations of applying copulas. Confusion about these requirements may lead to misconceptions and pitfalls, which can potentially compromise the robustness of risk analyses for environmental processes and natural hazards. We conducted a systematic literature review of copulas, as a prominent tool in the arsenal of multivariate methods used for compound event analysis, and underpinned them with a hydroclimatic case study in Sweden to illustrate a practical approach to copula-based modeling. Here, we (1) provide end-users with a didactic overview of necessary requirements, statistical assumptions and consequential limitations of copulas, (2) synthesize common perceptions and practices, and (3) offer a user-friendly decision support framework to employ copulas, thereby support researchers and practitioners in addressing hydroclimatic hazards, hence demystify what can be an area of confusion.",

      "citations": 73,
      "abstract": "This review provides a synthesis of advances in our understanding of urban flood processes and their modelling over the last four years (2018–2021). Four aspects are covered: knowledge of urban flood flow and transport processes, stability of humans and objects within flooded streets, reliability of computational modelling and approaches for speeding-up computations of urban flood event. New laboratory setups have shed light on previously unexplored processes such as flow intrusion into buildings or contaminant exchanges between surface and underground drainage. The stability of a single pedestrians or object (e.g., vehicles, waste containers) under urban flooding was analysed, but not group effects such as clogging. Improvements in computations were achieved by new strategies for merging and processing various sources of high quality topographic and forcing data (e.g., precipitation), the incorporation of more and more details on the drainage systems (e.g., effect of gullies), and 3D instead of 2D simulations. Computational efficiency was enhanced based on massive parallelization, adaptive mesh, porosity models, surrogate models as well as machine learning. Finally crowd-sourced data are shown to offer an avenue for next generation model validation methods. Remaining knowledge gaps and guidance for future research are proposed and predict that additional research work will be performed in following years.",

It is highly associated with the 3rd (good health and well-being), the 6th (clean water and sanitation), and the 14th (life below water) listed items of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Thus, policymakers have always been seeking strategies to manage WQ efficiently. Recent advancements in computational technologies have created enthusiasm for using artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning (DL), in WQ management. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the application of DL in WQ management, covering developments from 2011 to 2022, in maintaining the temporal relevance of this review. In this paper, a brief description of different variants of DL models, including the recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory network (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN), etc, are presented. The distinct approaches in the optimization, hybridization and relevant data pre-processing techniques suitable for the DL models, are also discussed. This is the first review paper that extensively discusses the application of DL models for forecasting WQ parameters in various water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, coastal areas, etc. The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing that revolutionized DL approaches in WQ management are also presented. This review paper serves as a complete easy guideline for the researchers in the field of DL-based WQ management. The findings of this review paper may help policymakers to enhance their decision-making process with the hope that regional environmental welfare can drastically be improved.",

      "citations": 43,
      "abstract": "Demands for water services from forested watersheds have dramatically increased since the 1950s and the trend continues as global environmental change intensifies in the 21st century. The goal of this study is to provide an overview of existing hydrological modeling tools that can be used in watershed management in a forest environment, offer guidance of model uses, and identify knowledge gaps in model development and applications. We classify 47 selected hydrological models according to their development purposes, theories, functionalities, and potentials to be applied in Decision Support Systems (DSS) for addressing five emerging watershed management challenges. We found that generic field, forest stand, and watershed-scale hydrological models developed in the 1980s–1990s are readily available for being incorporated into DSS for projecting hydrological responses to climate and land cover changes and address other watershed management problems. However, these models rarely explicitly link forest structure and species-level information to hydrological processes and functions, thus have limited utilities to answer specific forest management questions. Since early 2000s, hydrological models have incorporated energy, vegetation, terrain, and ecohydrological processes to begin to answer questions at hillslope to regional scales. However, routine uses of advanced modeling tools in forest watershed decision making remain challenging. Future model development should integrate multiple stressors and fine scale ecosystem and surface processes (e.g., vegetation dynamics, energy partitioning, and biogeochemical cycling), and balance model complexity, applicability, and access. Effective forest watershed DSS should have the ability to forecast short and long-term consequences of forest management decisions that often involve high risk and uncertainty under environmental change. In addition, DSS should integrate both physical and social aspects of watershed sciences that value indigenous culture and values.",

      "journal": "Hydrological Processes",
      "citations": 10,
      "abstract": "Prescribed fires are one of the most effective tools to reduce the risk of wildfires but this treatment may negatively affect the hydrological and erosive response of soil, with noticeable increases in surface runoff and soil erosion. Many studies have been published on this matter but there is no consensus in the literature on the magnitude and duration of these effects since the relevant hydrological conditions are site‐specific. Moreover, the relationship between post‐fire hydrology and its main environmental drivers has been little explored. This study has carried out a bibliographic review and a meta‐analysis of the changes resulting from prescribed fire applications (water infiltration, soil water repellency (SWR), surface runoff and soil erosion) using a database of 85 case studies from 41 academic papers that have been published over the last 23 years. The effects of annual precipitation, soil slope, burn severity, fire application season, post‐fire ground cover, and vegetation type on those changes have also been statistically explored. The bibliographic review has revealed that previous case studies have not been equally distributed across the globe but concentrated in only a few countries, mainly the United States and Spain. The meta‐analysis has revealed that (i) water infiltration generally decreases and SWR appears with noticeable increases in surface runoff and soil erosion immediately after the prescribed fire, while the pre‐fire values progressively recover over time; (ii) the window of disturbance in burned soils may last a few months (with some exceptions); (iii) annual precipitation and soil slope significantly influence water infiltration and surface runoff, but not soil erosion, in both the short‐term and medium‐term; (iv) moderate‐to‐high levels of soil burn severity severely enhance surface runoff and soil erosion, and noticeably reduce water infiltration in the short‐term; (v) the level of ground cover burning is important for reducing the runoff rates, but it plays a minor role in water infiltration and soil erosion rates;and (vi) the prescribed fire applied in spring results in lower increases in short‐term runoff and erosion, while fire applications in summer and in shrublands produce the highest increases in soil loss. The following practical recommendations arise from this study: (i) research should be better distributed across all environmental contexts on a global scale; (ii) post‐fire management actions should be immediately implemented after the prescribed fire application; (iii) prescribed fire should be carried out in spring and the soil burn severity should be kept low during burning; (iv) the monitoring studies should be prolonged at least for some years (more than two or three) after prescribed fire; (iv) the catchment‐scale investigations, although more difficult and expensive, should be encouraged (avoiding, however, areas to sparsely burnt in the context of the whole catchment); (v) the monitored variables should also include the most important physical, chemical and biological properties of soil, the cover and structure of regenerating vegetation, as well as the water quality parameters; (vi) the effects of repeated applications of prescribed fire should be experimentally assessed; and (vii) guidelines for standardized and appropriate measurements and analytical methods in experimental activities should be set up. These indications support the use of land managers in the monitoring of the hydrological impacts of the prescribed fire and in the choice of sites where post‐fire management actions must be implemented. The last recommendation of this study is the creation of an experimental database supporting the bibliographic review and the meta‐analysis, which ...",

      "abstract": "In the field of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), the deployment of sensitivity analysis has become a fundamental approach to testing the robustness and reliability of the results obtained. Its importance lies in its ability to gain additional insight into potential changes that affect the desirability of the decision variants being evaluated. Through different methodologies, it reveals the vulnerability of results to changes in the underlying data, thus offering valuable information to support decision making. This research paper highlights a compendium of 250 researches involving the application of sensitivity analysis in a multi-criteria context. Using a structured approach of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, this study provides a comprehensive review process. The main objectives are to identify and categorize common sensitivity analysis techniques explained in the literature and to describe a selected framework that facilitates the execution of these techniques. The research demonstrates the importance of sensitivity analysis to enhance the credibility of MCDA outcomes and contributes to the field of decision support.",

      "abstract": "Hydro-ecological models are important tools used to estimate streamflow from mountainous watersheds as driven by precipitation and snowmelt under the influence of different spatially variable hydro-ecological response variables. These models enable us to gain insight into hydrological and ecological processes occurring in the watershed. In the present study, a hydro-ecological model, Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys) was set up for a small representative watershed in Eastern Himalayan region of Arunachal Pradesh to investigate spatial variation in saturation deficit during snow depletion period. RHESSys model is capable of estimating variations in evaporation, transpiration, streamflow, overland flow, saturation deficit, etc. from the landscape. Studies related to hydrological and ecological sustainability of the Eastern Himalayan Rivers are limited, although a major part of the region is covered with evergreen forests, where ecological parameters may have a great impact on watershed hydrology. Nuranang watershed, which is located in Tawang district of Arunachal Pradesh, India, was selected as the study area. The hydro-meteorological data from 2004 to 2008 were collected from Central Water Commission (CWC). Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with 30 m spatial resolution was downloaded from NASA website. Calibration of the RHESSys model was performed for the depletion period of 2004 (13th April–21st August) and 2005 (17th April–4th September) and the model was validated for the years 2008 (17th April–20th September) and 2009 (13th April–23rd September) using observed streamflow at the watershed outlet. Comparison plot of the actual and log values of observed and simulated daily discharges showed that the model captured the variations in total observed discharge and subsurface flows reasonably well for both the calibration and validation years. Daily time-series outputs of various hydrological variables, i.e., subsurface flow, overland flow, streamflow, saturation deficit, and percentage saturated area, were obtained for both calibration and validation simulation. For simulation years, overland flow dominated stream discharge in all the months, and contributed around 60% of the total streamflow, whereas subsurface flow contributed around 40% in all the months. Comparatively, saturation deficit was more in the month of April due to less precipitation and it was reduced in the month of May because of pre-monsoon rainfall. It increased again in the month of June as the precipitation in the month was less compared to May. Then, it decreased again in the subsequent months of July and August due to high rainfall during the monsoon season and increased in the month of September. Average saturation deficit was estimated to be 389.69 mm and average percentage saturated area was estimated as 9.52%. The number of saturated pixels was found to be minimum in the month of April, while a maximum number of saturated pixels were observed in the month of August indicating the existence of inverse relationship between precipitation and saturation deficit for the study area.",

      "journal": "Hydrological Processes",
      "citations": 17,
      "abstract": "Water resources availability is one of the main concerns for policy makers around the world in present and future management plans. In the Mediterranean basin, this concern is increased given the extreme variability in climate and the intrinsic aridity conditions. Water resources in the Mediterranean region depend mainly on surface and subsurface supply from mountain areas. Because evapotranspiration comprises a substantial portion of the water budget, recent land cover changes due to cropland abandonment may change transpiration (TRANS) and water supply. Therefore, land management plans must account for these potential hydrologic changes to guarantee water availability in the upcoming decades. Short‐term changes to water yield have been shown to follow afforestation or natural revegetation, the main management strategies in abandoned cropland areas. Studies comparing long‐term trends of these management practices, however, are scarce due to the lack of long‐term hydrological data. In this study, we use the regional hydro‐ecological simulation system (RHESSys), to analyse long‐term changes and annual and seasonal trends in streamflow (STR) and transpiration following management of abandoned cropland areas. Annual mean values show significant differences between the three management scenarios for both streamflow and transpiration, while differences between climate scenarios are not significant. The Mann Kendall trend analysis shows significant changes to water yield compared to the situation before management. Depending on the total afforested area, afforestation could significantly decrease annual streamflow between 2.3%·decade −1 and 5.9%·decade −1 and increase annual transpiration between 1.1%·decade −1 and 3.5%·decade −1 . These trends are attributed to changes during the first 30 years after management, while during the fourth and fifth decade, changes to water yield tend to stabilize or decrease. These results are substantial to optimize land management plans, ensuring sustainable hydrological and ecological ecosystem services.",

      "abstract": "Grid-based spatially distributed hydrological modeling has become feasible with advances in watershed routing schemes, remote sensing technology, and computing resources. However, the need for long-running times on a substantial set of computational resources prevents a spatially detailed modeling program from being widely used, particularly in fine-resolution large-scale studies. Parallelizing computational tasks successfully mitigate this difficulty. We propose a novel way to improve the simulation efficiency of direct runoff transport processes by grouping watershed areas based on a time-area routing scheme. The proposed parallelization method was applied to simulating the runoff routing processes of two watersheds in different sizes and landscapes. The method substantially improved the computational efficiency of the time-area routing simulation with common computing resources. The efficiency of the parallelization was not limited by the hierarchical relationship between upstream and downstream catchments along the flow paths, which could be possible with the Lagrangian tracking of the time-area routing method.",

      "abstract": "The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission, expected to launch in 2022, will enable near global river discharge estimation from surface water extents and elevations. However, SWOT’s orbit specifications provide non-uniform space–time sampling. Previous studies have demonstrated that SWOT’s unique spatiotemporal sampling has a minimal impact on derived discharge frequency distributions, baseflow magnitudes, and annual discharge characteristics. In this study, we aim to extend the analysis of SWOT’s added value in the context of hydrologic model calibration. We calibrate a hydrologic model using previously derived synthetic SWOT discharges across 39 gauges in the Ohio River Basin. Three discharge timeseries are used for calibration: daily observations, SWOT temporally sampled, and SWOT temporally sampled including estimated uncertainty. Using 10,000 model iterations to explore predefined parameter ranges, each discharge timeseries results in similar optimal model parameters. We find that the annual mean and peak flow values at each gauge location from the optimal parameter sets derived from each discharge timeseries differ by less than 10% percent on average. Our findings suggest that hydrologic models calibrated using discharges derived from SWOT’s non-uniform space–time sampling are likely to achieve results similar to those based on calibrating with in situ daily observations.",

A modelling framework supported by field observations was applied to assess the probability of drying in headwaters at the regional scale ( P D ) under climate change. Empirical relationships between severity of low flows and observed proportions of no-flow states have been calibrated for 22 hydro-ecoregions under present conditions. These relationships were applied using daily discharge data on a large set of gauging stations simulated by the Modèle du Génie Rural à 6 paramètres Journalier (GR6J) hydrological model under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. The results suggest a more contrasting spatial pattern in the future than under current conditions. Noteworthy changes include increases in drying extent and duration, particularly in regions with historically high probabilities of drying and changes in seasonality in Alpine regions. Aquatic ecosystems will experience unprecedented hydrological conditions, which might lead to losses of ecosystem functions.",

We evaluated the frequency of precipitation in different classes, i.e. below 5, 5–10, 10–15, and above 15 mm/day. Our results indicate a decline in streamflow at 25 catchments, at a rate of −5.66 to −0.19 mm/year. The annual precipitation amount did not decrease significantly, while the frequency of light precipitation events (<5 mm/day) increased. About 60% of the upward trend was significant. Mean temperature increased at all studied catchments, at an average rate of 0.055°C/year. In short, our results indicate that increases in temperature and the frequency of light precipitation events are two leading factors in streamflow reduction across studied catchments.",

      "abstract": "Identifying the effect of climate variability and human activities on runoff changes is scientifically essential for understanding hydrological processes and sustainable water resources management. This study selected 64 catchments located in the mainland of China to quantify the effects of different driving forces on runoff changes. Results showed that annual runoff in the Haihe river basin, Liaohe river basin, and Yellow river basin exhibited significantly decreasing trends from 1965 to 2018 ( P < 0.05), whereas the Northwest river basin had positive trends in the annual runoff. Meanwhile, the Pettitt test method was applied to detect abrupt changes in annual runoff. Compared to the rivers in Southern China, the northern rivers had significant abrupt changes in annual runoff and mostly occurred in the 1990 s. The Choudhury-Yang equation based on the Budyko hypothesis was used to assess the sensitivity of runoff to precipitation (P), potential evapotranspiration (ET 0 ), and the land surface ( n ) changes. The results showed that runoff was more sensitive to P and n , compared to ET 0 . Attribution analysis revealed that P was the dominant factor in the Northwest river basin, Southwest river basin, Yangtze river basin, Southeast river basin, and Pearl river basin, whereas the changes in n were responsible for runoff changes in the Liaohe river basin, Haihe river basin, Yellow river Basin, Songhuajiang river basin, and Huaihe river basin. The land surface changes ( n ) were resulted from vegetation restoration, urbanization expansion, construction of reservoirs/check dams, and surface water withdrawals, leading to significant changes in river runoff in recent years. The findings can provide good insight for water resources management across China.",

      "abstract": "The present study analyzes trends of extreme flows for the Krishna river at the Prakasam barrage, Vijayawada of Andhra Pradesh state, India. Annual maximum and minimum flows are considered using available data from the CWC (Central Water Commission) portal from 1965–1966 to 2019–2020. The trend analysis of extreme flows is carried out using the Mann-Kendall trend test, Sen’s slope, and modified Mann-Kendall test, that is, bootstrapped Mann-Kendall trend test with optional bias-corrected pre-whitening. Also, R programming is applied for the trend analysis of extreme flows. Extreme annual flows are in decreasing trend. Annual maximum flow has significant decreasing trend with Sen’s slope of 105.52 cumecs per year. Annual minimum flow has insignificant decreasing trend at a magnitude of 0.0002 cumecs per year. Trend results of the present study are useful for the trend analysis of extreme river flows.",

      "journal": "Environmental Research Letters",
      "citations": 29,
      "abstract": "Non-perennial rivers and streams make up over half the global river network and are becoming more widespread. Transitions from perennial to non-perennial flow are a threshold-type change that can lead to alternative stable states in aquatic ecosystems, but it is unknown whether streamflow itself is stable in either wet (flowing) or dry (no-flow) conditions. Here, we investigated drivers and feedbacks associated with regime shifts between wet and dry conditions in an intermittent reach of the Arkansas River (USA) over the past 23 years. Multiple lines of evidence suggested that these regimes represent alternative stable states, including (a) significant jumps in discharge time series that were not accompanied by jumps in flow drivers such as precipitation and groundwater pumping;(b) a multi-modal state distribution with 92% of months experiencing no-flow conditions for 90% of days, despite unimodal distributions of precipitation and pumping; and (c) a hysteretic relationship between climate and flow state. Groundwater levels appear to be the primary control over the hydrological regime, as groundwater levels in the alluvial aquifer were higher than the stream stage during wet regimes and lower than the streambed during dry regimes. Groundwater level variation, in turn, was driven by processes occurring at both the regional scale (surface water inflows from upstream, groundwater pumping) and the reach scale (stream–aquifer exchange, diffuse recharge through the soil column). Historical regime shifts were associated with diverse pressures including network disconnection caused by upstream water use, increased flow stability potentially associated with reservoir operations, and anomalous wet and dry climate conditions. In sum, stabilizing feedbacks among upstream inflows, stream–aquifer interactions, climate, vegetation, and pumping appear to create alternative wet and dry stable states at this site. These stabilizing feedbacks suggest that widespread observed shifts from perennial to non-perennial flow will be difficult to reverse.",

We examined trends and break points in streamflow, precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and we estimated climate elasticity with Fu’s equation within the Budyko framework to further separate the contributions of climate and human changes to streamflow alterations. Results showed break points in streamflow in all catchments between 1981 and 1985, followed by decreases in average annual streamflow that varied between −28.1% and −53.4%. Most of the streamflow decline was found to be due to climate contribution: 63.1% in Argeș (the most anthropized catchment), 71.2% in Buzău, 79.2% in Ialomița and 80.2% in Vedea basin. Due to the environmental changes impacting water resources in Romania, estimating the contribution of the main drivers of streamflow change is highly important for their sustainable management.",

      "abstract": "Baseflow is an important water resource because it supplies streamflow between precipitation events and during dry seasons. We report the first continental assessment of baseflow in Africa by analyzing the baseflow index, baseflow seasonality, and monthly baseflow trends for three periods (1950–2018, 1950–1980, and 1981–2018). To explain changes in baseflow, we analyze precipitation trends. Results highlight that the baseflow season in west-central Africa occurs during August–November. In southern and northern Africa, the baseflow season is similar (January–May and January–April, respectively). Trend analysis detected monthly baseflow decreases in west-central Africa over the entire record and from 1950 to 1980, with increases after 1980. A clear pattern was absent in southern Africa for the whole record, but increases were detected earlier and decreases from 1981 to 2018. In northern Africa, decreasing baseflow trends were pronounced over the whole record, with no clear shift present. Precipitation trends were only consistent with baseflow changes in west-central Africa.",

      "citations": 14,
      "abstract": "Nonpoint source (NPS) pollution shows spatial scaling effects because it is affected by topography, river networks, and many other factors. Currently, the lack of an integrated methodology for quantifying the scaling effect has become a crucial barrier in evaluating NPS pollution. In this study, a new method was proposed for scaling NPS pollution by integrating hydrological model and hydrological alteration indicators. Nested catchments were delineated by eight-direction algorithm, and a semidistributed hydrological model was used to simulate the interannual process within the drainage area and to obtain data series of runoff, sediment, and total phosphorus (TP) at different spatial scales. In addition, the average, the extrema, the change rate and feature variables of each type of indicators were proposed to quantitatively describe the pattern of NPS pollution at different spatial scales. The results show the coefficients of variation (CVs) of most runoff and TP indicators are 0.6–0.8, while those of sediment vary greatly from 0.4 to 1.6 with the threshold of those indicators being 0.33. With the increase in drainage area, the NPS load-related indicators show an increasing trend, while load intensity indicators show a decreasing trend and their changing patterns are affected by the heterogeneity of topographic or hydrological information included. Based on logarithmic variance of the change rate, 825 km 2 was identified as the turning point for scaling transformation where the slope changes dramatically. The proposed methodology comprehensively describes features of the NPS scaling effect that could be utilized for targeted monitoring and control of NPS pollution in other watersheds.",

Here we analyze 3,885 streamgages across the conterminous United States and attribute the inter-annual variability in annual maximum discharge to precipitation and temperature. This is accomplished by first developing gamma regression models to describe the seasonal maximum discharge in terms of basin-averaged precipitation, temperature, and antecedent wetness (i.e., the basin-averaged precipitation for the season prior to the one of interest, and used as a proxy for antecedent soil moisture conditions). These seasonal models are then mixed through a Monte Carlo approach to obtain the annual maximum discharge distribution. Despite its simplicity, our results show that the developed statistical attribution approach can describe very well the inter-annual variability in annual maximum discharge across the conterminous United States.",

      "abstract": "Human activities and climate change pose a continuous threat to the ecological stability of natural rivers in many ways. Understanding and analyzing changes in flow regimes from a multidimensional perspective is essential for water resources management. In this research, a comprehensive evaluation framework was developed to quantitatively assess the hydrological condition of the basin in four aspects: river flow regime, ecological water demand, multiple time scales, and drivers. The health status of the Yuanjiang River was assessed using a combination of Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) and eco-flow metrics, and differences in different drivers at different time scales were quantified based on the Choudhury-Yang equation and the ABCD model. The results show that after the abrupt change of the Yuanjiang River in 2004, the runoff decreased by up to 72.97 mm, three of the five groups of IHA reached moderate alteration or above, and its ecological flow was in a tight state for a long time. In addition, the reduction of runoff by precipitation and potential evapotranspiration is not negligible (contribution 40.56%, 6.91%), and the drastic changes in land use and the construction and operation of cascade reservoirs highlight the human impact (contribution 52.53%). Anthropogenic contributions to runoff changes deepen in the order of spring, summer, fall, and winter (6%, 51%, 83%, 95%), and on a monthly scale, human activities were the dominant factor in runoff variability in nine months (61-98%), with climatic factors driving runoff increases of 0.24-6.07 mm only in March, June, September, November, and December.",

      "abstract": "The Hydrologic Reference Stations is a network of 467 high-quality streamflow gauging stations across Australia that is developed and maintained by the Bureau of Meteorology as part of an ongoing responsibility under the Water Act 2007. The main objectives of the service are to observe and detect climate-driven changes in observed streamflow and to provide a quality-controlled dataset for research. We investigate trends and step changes in streamflow across Australia in data from all 467 streamflow gauging stations. Data from 30 to 69 years in duration ending in February 2019 were examined. We analysed data in terms of water-year totals and for the four seasons. The commencement of the water year varies across the country - mainly from February-March in the south to September-October in the north. We summarized our findings for each of the 12 drainage divisions defined by Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (Geofabric) and for continental Australia as a whole. We used statistical tests to detect and analyse linear and step changes in seasonal and annual streamflow. Monotonic trends were detected using modified Mann-Kendall (MK) tests, including a variance correction approach (MK3), a block bootstrap approach (MK3bs) and a long-term persistence approach (MK4). A nonparametric Pettitt test was used for step-change detection and identification. The regional significance of these changes at the drainage division scale was analysed and synthesized using a Walker test. The Murray-Darling Basin, home to Australia's largest river system, showed statistically significant decreasing trends for the region with respect to the annual total and all four seasons. Drainage divisions in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania showed significant annual and seasonal decreasing trends. Similar results were found in south-western Western Australia, South Australia and north-eastern Queensland. There was no significant spatial pattern observed in central nor mid-west Western Australia, with one possible explanation for this being the sparse density of streamflow stations and/or the length of the datasets available. Only the Tanami-Timor Sea Coast drainage division in northern Australia showed increasing trends and step changes in annual and seasonal streamflow that were regionally significant. Most of the step changes occurred during 1970-1999. In the south-eastern part of Australia, the majority of the step changes occurred in the 1990s, before the onset of the “Millennium Drought”. Long-term monotonic trends in observed streamflow and its regional significance are consistent with observed changes in climate experienced across Australia. The findings of this study will assist water managers with long-term infrastructure planning and management of water resources under climate variability and change across Australia.",

Daily flow data from three Jing River outlets (SongZiKou (SZK), TaiPingKou (TPK), and OuChiKou (OCK)) spanning 1955–2019 were used. We employed innovative methods, such as IHA–RVA and annual distribution, to establish ecological flow thresholds. Surplus and deficit indicators were used to analyze annual and seasonal runoff dynamics. The PCA/RVA method identified relevant hydrological indicators and assessed hydrological changes influenced by the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). Key findings include suitable ecological flow thresholds for the flood season (SZK/TPK/OCK – 218.6/94.5, 51.7/96.0, and 60.9–4,494.5 m 3 /s, respectively). The TGR impacted the flow duration curve, causing deficits during the flood season (up to 0.99, OCK) and surpluses in non-flood seasons (up to 5.04, OCK). The study assessed the Jing River watershed's response to hydrological changes, notably due to the reservoir's water storage and flow interruption during the dry season, revealing declining low pulse count (SDG) and duration (MTS) and increasing high pulse duration (GJP). This research employs innovative methods and hydrological indicators, enhancing understanding of Jing River watershed ecological hydrology, and offering essential data for water resource management and ecosystem health.",

Analysis of the spatial variability of these maximum flows measured from 1930 to 2018 in 17 watersheds revealed that the magnitude of flows is approximately twice as low on the north shore as it is on the south shore south of 47° N. This difference is explained by three main factors: wetlands (negative correlation) and agricultural (positive correlation) surface area, and summer–fall total precipitation (positive correlation). As for the temporal variability of flows, the different Mann–Kendall statistical tests showed a significant increase in flows due to increased rainfall. The increase of flows was more widespread on the north shore than on the south because the storage capacity of wetlands and other water bodies does not change over time to store excess rainfall. On the south shore, the increase in flows over time is limited due to the significant reduction in agricultural areas since the modernization of agriculture. This reduction favored infiltration to the detriment of runoff.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Research",
      "citations": 78,
      "abstract": "Runoff prediction in ungauged catchments is a significant hydrological challenge. The common approach is to calibrate hydrological models against streamflow data from gauged catchments, and then regionalize or transfer parameter values from the gauged calibration to predict runoff in the ungauged catchments. This paper explores the potential for using parameter values from hydrological models calibrated solely against readily available remotely sensed evapotranspiration data to estimate runoff time series. The advantage of this approach is that it does not require observed streamflow data for model calibration and is therefore particularly useful for runoff prediction in poorly gauged or ungauged regions. The modeling experiments are carried out using data from 222 catchments across Australia. The results from the remotely sensed evapotranspiration runoff-free calibration are encouraging, particularly in simulating monthly runoff and mean annual runoff in the wetter catchments. However, results for daily runoff and in the drier regions are relatively poor, and further developments are needed to realize the benefit of direct model calibration against remotely sensed data to predict runoff in ungauged catchments.",

      "journal": "Remote Sensing",
      "citations": 54,
      "abstract": "Hydrological models are usually calibrated against observed streamflow (Q obs ), which is not applicable for ungauged river basins. A few studies have exploited remotely sensed evapotranspiration (ET RS ) for model calibration but their effectiveness on streamflow simulation remains uncertain. This paper investigates the use of ET RS in the hydrological calibration of a widely used land surface model coupled with a source–sink routing scheme and global optimization algorithm for 28 natural river basins. A baseline simulation is a setup based on the latest model developments and inputs. Sensitive parameters are determined for Q obs and ET RS -based model calibrations, respectively, through comprehensive sensitivity tests. The ET RS -based model calibration results in a mean Kling–Gupta Efficiency (KGE) value of 0.54 for streamflow simulation; 61% of the river basins have KGE > 0.5 in the validation period, which is consistent with the calibration period and provides a significant improvement over the baseline. Compared to Q obs , the ET RS calibration produces better or similar streamflow simulations in 29% of the basins, while further significant improvements are achieved when either better ET or precipitation observations are used. Furthermore, the model results show better or similar performance in 68% of the basins and outperform the baseline simulations in 90% of the river basins using model parameters from the best ET RS calibration runs. This study confirms that with reasonable precipitation input, the ET RS -based spatially distributed calibration can efficiently tune parameters for better ET and streamflow simulations. The application of ET RS for global scale hydrological model calibration promises even better streamflow accuracy as the satellite-based ET RS observations continue to improve.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 39,
      "abstract": "How urbanization-associated land use/land cover change (LULCC) affects the ecohydrological cycle through altering evapotranspiration (ET) processes is not clear for rice paddy dominated watersheds. The purpose of this study was to understand long-term (2000–2013) spatial and temporal variations of ET over the Qinhuai River Basin in a humid region, southern China. We revised the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) by incorporating new algorithms describing hydrological processes of rice paddies. Using the improved SWAT model driven by remote sensing-derived LULCC and local climatic data, we separated the effects of LULCC on ET from climate at the watershed scale. We showed that the modified SWAT model significantly improved monthly streamflow estimates. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency ( NSE ) was 0.86 and coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) was 0.88 for the calibration period (1990–1994) while the NSE was 0.65 and R 2 was 0.71 for the validation period (1995–1999). We also found good agreements between modelled daily ET and lysimeter-based measurements for an experimental rice paddy field ( R 2 = 0.75, p less than 0.01). For areas with little land cover change, ET rates increased over time due to the increase in potential ET (PET) during 2000–2013. However, the contribution from rice paddy to the watershed-level ET decreased over time coincident with a period of rapid urbanization and loss of rice paddy field. Dynamic attribution analysis indicated that the negative contribution of LULCC to change in ET increased from 53% in 2000 to 61% in 2013 while the positive contribution of climate variability decreased from 47% in 2000 to 39% in 2013. We concluded that factors affecting ET varied with spatial scale. Conversion of rice paddy field to urban use directly resulted in significant ET reduction at the watershed scale despite the rise in the air temperature and potential ET in the study region. The improved SWAT model provides a better integrated method for understanding ET processes and assessing the impacts of environmental change on ecosystem services in a rapidly urbanizing region.",

      "abstract": "Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important variable to explore coupled relationships in carbon and water cycles. In this study, we first compared the spatial variations of annual gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) using four GPP and ET products. Second, we selected the products closest to the flux towers data to estimate WUE. Finally, we quantitatively analyzed the impact of climate change and soil water content on WUE. The results showed that: (1) Four GPP and ET products provided good performance, with GOSIF-GPP and FLDAS-ET exhibiting a higher correlation and the smallest errors with the flux tower data. (2) The spatial pattern of WUE is consistent with that of GPP and ET, gradually decreasing from the northeast to the southwest. Higher WUE values appeared in the northeast forest ecosystem, and lower WUE values occurred in the western Gobi Desert, with a value of 0.28 gC m −2 mm −1 . The GPP and ET products showed an increasing trend, while WUE showed a decreasing trend (55.15%) from 2001 to 2020. (3) The spatial relationship between WUE and driving factors reveal the variations in WUE of Inner Mongolia are mainly affected by soil moisture between 0 and 10 cm (SM0–10cm), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and precipitation, respectively. (4) In arid regions, VPD and precipitation exhibit a major influence on WUE. An increase in VPD and precipitation has a negative and positive effect on WUE, with threshold values of approximately 0.36 kPa and 426 mm, respectively. (5) In humid regions, SM0–10cm, VPD, SM10–40cm, and SM40–100cm exert a significant impact on WUE, especially SM0–10cm, and weakens with increasing soil depths, these differences may be related to physiological structure and living characteristics of vegetation types in different climate regimes. Our results emphasize the importance of VPD and soil moisture in regional variability in WUE.",

      "citations": 80,
      "abstract": "Remote sensing–based flood inundation mapping and monitoring is very crucial input before, during, and after floods. Ganga–Ramganga doab is one of the prolonged flood-affected area in middle Ganga plain due to seasonal monsoon which leads to rise in water levels of Ganga and Ramganga rivers. The focus of the present study is to map severe flood condition captured through synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data during August–September 2018, and to explain the impact on Ramganga river morphology. SAR data is preferred for flood mapping and real-time monitoring in all weather conditions. In this study, dual-polarized (VV and VH) Sentinel-1 SAR images coupled with hydrological data (river water level) were used to produce flood inundation maps. Thresholding technique has been applied to determine the flood mapping through Sentinel-1 data. VH and VV polarisation methods have been applied for a comparison of their respective accuracies in delineating surface water. Results have been validated against a Sentinel-2 optical image, and both polarisations produced a total accuracy of more than 93%. VV polarisation has high accuracies than VH polarisation as similar results are observed in previous studies as well. The finding reveals that severe bank erosion took place in the Ramganga channel which significantly affected the channel morphology, mainly the massive mobilisation of channel sediments. The results show that the average channel width increased from 46 to 336 m. The proposed approach demonstrates that the microwave remote sensing data along with GIS can be used efficiently for flood inundation mapping, monitoring, and analysing its effect on channel morphology. Therefore, the results of this study will help to take the initiative to reduce the flood hazard impact in the doab area and increase the flexibility in the process of flood management.",

      "abstract": "Brahmaputra is one of the perennial rivers in India which causes floods every year in the north-east state of Assam causing hindrance to normal life and damage to crops. The availability of temporal Remote Sensing (RS) data helps to study the periodical changes caused by flood event and its eventual effect on natural environment. Integrating RS and GIS methods paved a way for effective flood mapping over a large spatial extent which helps to assess the damage accurately for mitigation. In the present study, multitemporal Sentinel-1A data is exploited to assess the 2017 flood situation of Brahmaputra River in Assam state. Five data sets that are taken during flood season and one reference data taken during the non-monsoon season are used to estimate the area inundated under floods for the quantification of damage assessment. A visual interpretation map is produced using colour segmentation method by estimating the thresholds from histogram analysis. A new method is developed to identify the optimum value for threshold from statistical distribution of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data that separates flooded water and non-flooded water. From this method, the range of backscatter values for normal water are identified as − 18 to − 30 dB and the range is identified as − 19 to − 24 dB for flooded water. The results showed that the method is able to separate the flooded and non-flooded region on the microwave data set, and the derived flood extent using this method shows the inundated area of 3873.14 Km2 on peak flood date for the chosen study area.",

In this study, we made an integrated use of GRACE data and meteorological data to characterize the TWS variations in the Yellow River basin (YRB) during 2003-2015 and investigated the relationships between terrestrial water storage change (TWSC) and human activities and climatic variability respectively. Additionally, a novel, simple but effective index was also proposed to quantify the contributions of different factors from climatic variability and human activities to TWSC in the YRB and its different subregions. The results indicated that there existed a significant TWS decrease at a rate of −4.6 ± 1.4 mm/yr (approximately 3.7 ± 1.1 Gt/yr) across the entire YRB during the past decade. The variables including precipitation, PET and NDVI had a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.76, −0.63 and −0.38 respectively with TWSC at annual scale. Apart from these, the correlations between reservoir operation and annual TWSC also have been estimated for the first time, which showed a better performance (r = 0.85) than that between TWSC and water withdrawals (r = 0.40). The results mainly indicated that TWSC was attributed to the climatic variability while the intense human activities especially reservoir operation also generated a significant effect on TWSC in the YRB.

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 62,
      "abstract": "Measurement of regional water resource variations is significant for understanding water cycle and water management. This is especially true for transboundary river basins. This study investigated the terrestrial water storage dynamics of the Lancang-Mekong River basin, which has a total area of 795,000 km2 and distributed between six countries in Southeast Asia, based on the terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) model. A spatial weighted centroid analysis concept from geographical information science was introduced to track the movement of terrestrial water storage centroid of the basin. And the response of terrestrial water storage dynamics to climate variations throughout the basin was examined by quantifying the correlations of TWSA with a multi-scalar drought index. Results show that during 2003 to 2016, the upstream basin (Lancang River basin) experienced slight decreasing trends (ranging from −2.45 to 0 km3/yr revealed by five different GRACE solutions), and the downstream basin (Mekong River basin) generally did not express statistically significant trends; five GRACE solutions are more consistent in the downstream basin than the upstream basin, and the mascons-based TWSA processed at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) produced quite different results with the other four solutions. Generally, there are good correlations between GRACE observations and GLDAS model. The TWSA is 1-2 month lagged correlated with precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff anomalies, because water from precipitation may take a long period to loss from evapotranspiration and infiltrate into the soil. In general, water storage dynamics are closely correlated with climatic dry and wet conditions at middle-long periods (6-12 months) in the basin, and the correlation coefficients in wet season are generally higher than those in dry season. However, a different pattern was found since 2010: in the 2010-2016 period, correlations between TWSA and the multi-scalar drought index in Lancang River basin reduced relative to the 2003-2009 period but became stronger in Mekong River basin after 2009. The results of this study highlight the differentiation of water storage dynamics’ response to the climate variation between upstream and downstream of Lancang-Mekong basin in the period 2010-2016 and the possibility of examining basin storage disturbed by human activities in the basin.",

      "abstract": "Under dual impacts from climate change and human activities, the Yellow River Basin (YRB) of China suffers from droughts and water scarcity. Understanding variations of terrestrial water storage (TWS) over the YRB is significant and beneficial to regional water resources management and sustainable development. This study investigates TWS variations in the YRB using data sets from two solutions (RL05 and RL06) of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites, as well as from global land surface models (the NOAH model and Catchment Land Surface Model [CLSM]) and hydrology and water resources model (PCR‐GLOBWB). Annual terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) variation patterns were tracked by introducing a weighed centroid analysis concept. Human water use was analyzed, and its importance to TWS changes was evaluated by using the random forest algorithm. Conclusions can be briefly summarized as follows: (1) The declining trend of TWS in the YRB from the RL06 solution is more negative than that from RL05; the TWS trend from the PCR‐GLOBWB model is more consistent with GRACE than with the NOAH model and CLSM at the basin level, and the three models all underestimate the declining trend of TWS in the midstream relative to the GRACE solutions. (2) Spatial weighed centroids of annual GRACE TWSA moved toward the headwater of the YRB during the 2003–2015 period, suggesting a wide gap of TWS between the upstream and downstream YRB; the TWSA time series well correlate with the long‐term accumulation of climatic water balance, but the connections became weak in the 2010–2015 period. (3) Groundwater withdrawals have been controlled according to the Water Resources Bulletin, but the stress may be partly shifted to surface water; the increasing trend of ecological and industrial surface water use is significant, following the agriculture water use. (4) For the entire YRB, groundwater use accounts for the majority of feature importance in modeling TWSA time series, and the contribution of climate factors is the least. Agricultural water use ranks first relative to other sectors for the YRB, followed by the ecological and industrial use. This study provides a first comparison of TWSA between the latest Center for Space Research (CSR) GRACE RL06 solution and the previous RL05 solution in the YRB. The results are expected to present a comprehensive picture of TWS variations in the YRB and the impacts from climate and human factors.",

Simulations with and without GRACE-DA and with and without groundwater pumping for irrigation are performed to study the isolated and combined effects of groundwater irrigation and GRACE-DA on water and energy fluxes over the High Plains Aquifer (HPA). The results reveal that the DA-only simulation may erroneously distribute increments across water storage components and affect the related fluxes through biased feedbacks, while the irrigation-only simulation may overestimate groundwater decline due to shortcomings in the irrigation and groundwater parameterizations. Assimilating GRACE when irrigation is simulated produces the best overall performance for water storage trends over the northern HPA. For the southern HPA, GRACE assimilation with irrigation performs similarly to irrigation-only simulation for water storage components and evapotranspiration. GRACE assimilation also improves results in nonirrigated regions and can potentially alleviate the overestimation of groundwater trends in regions with greater irrigation uncertainties. This study highlights the potential to advance hydrological data assimilation in the context of anthropogenic water consumption and land-atmosphere interactions.",

      "abstract": "Estimation of human-induced evapotranspiration (ET) changes (e.g., irrigation) is critical for understanding terrestrial water and energy cycle in the Anthropocene. A few studies have detected human influence on ET through comparing natural ET from reanalysis models and actual ET estimated by the water budget analysis with Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage data. However, whether models can reasonably reproduce natural hydrological processes is overlooked. Here we show that uncertainty in model-simulated natural ET can determine whether the human-induced ET change is detectable. The naturalized runoff provided by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission is used to calibrate the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to obtain a more reliable estimation of natural ET. The actual ET is estimated by either using the GRACE satellite retrievals with coal mining-induced gravity change removed, or 192 soil moisture station observations combined with surface and ground water resources bulletin data over the Yellow River basin. By comparing with natural ET from VIC simulations, human-induced annual ET changes are 41 ± 23 to 59 ± 31 mm/year during 2003–2010 for GRACE and soil moisture-based estimations respectively, contributing to 11%–16% increase in annual ET over the Yellow River basin. The estimation is comparable to the bulletin data of 47 mm/year. There is an obvious overestimation in natural ET from Global Land Data Assimilation System, prohibiting the detection of anthropogenic influence. This study highlights the importance of reasonably modeling natural hydrological processes as a baseline for detecting anthropogenic influence on the hydrological cycle.",

      "abstract": "The total water storage change (TWSC) over land is a major component of the global water cycle, with a large influence on the climate variability, sea level budget and water resource availability for human life. Its first estimates at a large scale were made available with GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) observations for the 2002-2016 period, followed since 2018 by the launch of the GRACE-FO (Follow-On) mission. In this paper, using an approach based on the water mass conservation rule, we propose to merge satellite-based observations of precipitation and evapotranspiration with in situ river discharge measurements to estimate TWSC over longer time periods (typically from 1980 to 2016), compatible with climate studies. We performed this task over five major Asian basins, subject to both large climate variability and strong anthropogenic pressure for water resources and for which long-term records of in situ discharge measurements are available. Our Satellite Water Cycle (SAWC) reconstruction provides TWSC estimates very coherent in terms of seasonal and interannual variations with independent sources of information such as (1) TWSC GRACE-derived observations (over the 2002-2015 period), (2) ISBA-CTRIP (Interactions between Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere CNRM - Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques - Total Runoff Integrating Pathways) model simulations (1980-2015) and (3) the multi-satellite inundation extent (1993-2007). This analysis shows the advantages of the use of multiple satellite-derived datasets along with in situ data to perform a hydrologically coherent reconstruction of a missing water component estimate. It provides a new critical source of information for the long-term monitoring of TWSC and to better understand its critical role in the global and terrestrial water cycle.",

The Noah 3.3 LSM simulated soil moistures in four soil layers and root-zone soil moistures defined as a depth-weighted average in the first three soil layers (ie, up to 1.0 m deep). The Noah LSM soil moisture products were then compared with a satellite-based soil moisture dataset (European Space Agency Climate Change Initiatives (ESA CCI) SM v04. 4) and reanalysis soil moisture datasets (ERA-interim). In addition, the five major basins (Yangtze, Mekong, Mississippi, Murray-Darling, Amazon) were selected for the assesment with the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)-based Total Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA) and TWS Change (TWSC). The results revealed that high anomaly correlations were found in most of the Asia-Pacific regions including East Asia, South Asia, Australia, and Noth and South America. While the anomaly correlations in the Murray-Darling basin were somewhat low, relatively higher anomaly correlations in the other basins were found. It is concluded that this study can be useful for the development of soil moisture based drought indices and subsequently can be helpful to reduce damages from drought by timely providing an efficacious strategy.",

      "abstract": "River runoff is estimated as a water budget residual using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage time series, ERA5 reanalysis data, and precipitation observations for January 2003 through December 2015 for the Obidos upstream drainage basin and for the entire Amazon basin. Estimated runoff based on the water budget agrees remarkably well with in situ gauge observations at Obidos, especially at seasonal time scales, with nearly perfect phase agreement but slightly larger seasonal amplitude. The discrepancy in the seasonal amplitude may be attributed to underestimation of river gauge runoff during the wet season when water overflows the riverbanks. The ERA5 model appears to overestimate long‐term mean evapotranspiration in the Amazon by ~2 cm/month based on comparisons with precipitation and runoff observations. Using precipitation data based on satellites and gauge observations relative to gauge observations alone improved agreement between water budget runoff estimates and in situ runoff observations. Seasonal variations in ERA5‐simulated runoff are about twice as large as those from in situ observations and show a large phase lag as well. Water budget‐based runoff for the entire Amazon (~7,200 km 3 averaged over the 13‐year period) is significantly larger than observed runoff (~5,700 km 3 ) at Obidos and notably larger than previous estimates for the entire Amazon. These differences may be partly related to submarine runoff from the Amazon basin that cannot be captured by surface gauges.",

      "abstract": "The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission and its follow-on mission (GRACE Follow-On) can accurately track the Earth’s mass variations, which have been successfully used in various geoscience researches related to global and regional hydrological process. In this study, satellite gravimetry (GRACE and GRACR Follow-On) and hydrological model (GLDAS) are used to estimate the TWS variations over LBB in 2003–2020. As the world’s largest freshwater lake by volume, the terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations in Lake Baikal basin (LBB) significantly affect the surrounding ecological environment. However, the spatial scale of LBB is relatively small when compared to approximately 300 km spatial resolution of GRACE and GRACE Follow-On mission. Therefore, the forward modeling method is used to alleviate the leakage errors during satellite gravimetry data processing. To assess the performance of forward modeling method, a close-loop simulation study is designed in noise-contaminated condition. The simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of forward modeling method in accurately estimating TWS variations over LBB. After appropriate leakage correction, the inter-annual TWS from satellite gravimetry agrees well with GLDAS. The TWS variations over LBB demonstrate that (1) there are drastic variations and periodic characteristics around 4–5 years, and the drought events are observed in 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015 as relatively smaller TWSs. (2) The soil moisture and groundwater are the major contributors to TWS variations (with the correlation coefficient of 0.88 and 0.89), and the surface water is the main contributor to the seasonal variations over LBB. (3) The TWS presents about 6 moths delay to precipitation variations, while the precipitation is still the major driver to affect the hydrological processes over this region.",

Study focus This paper investigates the spatiotemporal characteristics of groundwater storage (GWS) changes in the NCP during 2003–2020 using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements with a focus on the subperiods separated by the implementation (December 2014) of the South-to-North Water Diversion Middle Route Project (MRP). New hydrological insights for the region GRACE-derived results demonstrate that GWS depleted at rates of − 1.66 ± 0.17 cm/yr and − 2.76 ± 0.55 cm/yr for subperiods of 2003–2014 and 2015–2020, respectively, suggesting that GWS continued decreasing after the MRP. However, the spatial distribution of average monthly GWS shows an evident southwest-northeast band distribution, and the GWS depletion in the northwest has been alleviated compared with the southeast. The GNSS stations in the Beijing area show accelerated increasing rates of vertical displacements, while those in the plain areas of Hebei and Tianjin show continuous declining rates, implying that GWS in the Beijing area recovered faster after the MRP, while the GWS depletion in plain areas of Hebei and Tianjin continued. In addition, precipitation is the main driving factor to GWS variability during the whole study period, with grey correlation coefficients of 0.66–0.75. This strong correlation explains the significant reduction in GWS caused by the large precipitation deficit in 2019, which leads to a larger GWS depletion rate for the 2015–2020 period.",

      "abstract": "Study area Iran. Study focus Iran, once a pioneer of sustainable water management, is currently facing water bankruptcy. Aggressive exhaustion of non-renewable water has led to a suite of environmental and socio-economic problems across the country. Nevertheless, the understanding of Iran’s water loss is still incomplete due to a lack of conclusive data. In this study, we employ satellite gravimetry observations, in-situ and globally precipitation data, and gauged groundwater level to investigate the total water storage (TWS) loss in Iran over the last two decades. New hydrological insights for the region We quantify Iran’s water loss using a data-driven approach supported by a Monte-Carlo simulation. Our analysis indicates TWS loss of 211 ± 34 km 3 (> twice Iran’s annual water consumption) within the 2003–2019 period. The mean groundwater level has dropped significantly at a rate of − 28 ± 1.4 cm/yr. This tremendous water loss happened despite an overall increased relative precipitation rate of + 4.9 ± 0.02 km 3 /yr. Thus the TWS loss can only be explained by drastic overexploitation of non-renewable water resources. Two major extreme events occurred during the study period, namely the 2007 drought and early 2019 floods. The former resulted in a total 115 ± 0.6 km 3 water loss, one-third of the long-term annual precipitation. Approximately the same amount was brought back by a series of extreme precipitation events leading to floods in early 2019. Our results raise critical issues regarding unsustainable water management in Iran and highlight the crucial role of spaceborne measurements for understanding short-term and long-term water availability change in the absence of sufficient ground data.",

In this study, we attempt to detect the signal of changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS) induced by reservoir operation during WSRS based on GRACE data. Meanwhile, a modified index is proposed to further assess the contributions of human activities and climatic variability to annual changes in TWS. The results indicated that the impounding or releasing events in the XLD reservoir and the LYX reservoir during WSRS can be well detected by monthly GRACE CSR solutions with the DDK3 filter. In addition, there exists a significant correlation between annual changes in TWS and reservoir water storage changes within both the catchment area above the LYX reservoir ( r s = 0.88, p < 0.01) and the catchment area above the XLD reservoir ( r s = 0.86, p < 0.01). The modified index proposed in this study, which is an attribution index based on a variation analysis, showed that reservoir operation contributes significantly to changes in TWS especially for heavily reservoir-regulated regions.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 25,
      "abstract": "The Taihang Mountain Region (TMR) of China is an important headwater area that provides substantial water resources supporting the social and ecological stability of the North China Plain. Currently, groundwater resources in the TMR are rapidly declining, but the degree of groundwater storage (GWS) depletion and the driving mechanism of groundwater drought remain poorly understood. This study combined the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) datasets to thoroughly analyze GWS changes in the TMR and the dominant driving factors during 2003–2016. In addition, a new index—the groundwater drought potential index (GDPI)—was established to quantify the potential of groundwater drought. We found that GRACE-derived terrestrial water storage in the TMR experienced a significant reduction (-21.82 mm/yr, p < 0.01) during 2003–2016, with a similar reduction in GWS (-21.22 mm/yr, p < 0.01). Human-induced impacts exerted a decisive role in GWS decreases in this region, with a relative contribution rate of 96% compared to the climatic contribution (4%). Climatic impacts on GWS were primarily observed in the southeastern TMR, where climate change appeared to be unbeneficial to groundwater recovery and exacerbated local groundwater depletion. Specifically, the groundwater drought potential was entirely increasing, indicating a worsened climate condition that precipitation increasingly failed to fill the groundwater deficit. Actions should be taken urgently to address the local groundwater crisis and to maintain water security. Our proposed GDPI not only reflected the degree of groundwater depletion but also revealed the relationship between groundwater drought and precipitation, making the index capable of being applied in drought forecasting. This study delivers a new perspective to better understand the mechanisms of GWS change and groundwater drought, and the results are expected to provide a valuable reference for groundwater management and water sustainability goals.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the hydrologic performance of gridded precipitation datasets for streamflow simulation in Ethiopia. Four products are prominent in the literature, namely Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), Climate Hazards Group Infra-Red Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 Version 7 (3B42V7). The datasets from these products were compared statistically with the gauge observation dataset. Furthermore, the hydrologic performance of the products was evaluated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model in two watersheds of the Lake Ziway basin. Four statistical and three contingency indices were used to compare the precipitation products statistically, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percent bias (PBIAS) and the ratio of mean square error (RSR) were used to compare streamflow simulations. All the satellite-based precipitation products (CHIRPS, PERSIANN-CDR, and TRMM) performed well for monthly streamflow simulations for both watersheds. The reanalysis product CFSR performed the worst with high mean error (ME) and relative bias ratio (BIAS). The high ME and BIAS values of CFSR adversely affected the hydrologic performance and resulted in unsatisfactory streamflow simulation. Performance of the CHIRPS precipitation product in capturing daily and monthly streamflows showed that it can provide valuable precipitation estimates for use as input in hydrologic models in data-\nsparse regions of developing countries such as Ethiopia.",

      "abstract": "The accurate representation of spatio-temporal patterns of precipitation is an essential input for numerous environmental applications. However, the estimation of precipitation patterns derived solely from rain gauges is subject to large uncertainties. We present the Random Forest based MErging Procedure (RF-MEP), which combines information from ground-based measurements, state-of-the-art precipitation products, and topography-related features to improve the representation of the spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation, especially in data-scarce regions. RF-MEP is applied over Chile for 2000—2016, using daily measurements from 258 rain gauges for model training and 111 stations for validation. Two merged datasets were computed: RF-MEP 3 P (based on PERSIANN-CDR, ERA-Interim, and CHIRPSv2) and RF-MEP 5 P (which additionally includes CMORPHv1 and TRMM 3B42v7). The performances of the two merged products and those used in their computation were compared against MSWEPv2.2, which is a state-of-the-art global merged product. A validation using ground-based measurements was applied at different temporal scales using both continuous and categorical indices of performance. RF-MEP 3 P and RF-MEP 5 P outperformed all the precipitation datasets used in their computation, the products derived using other merging techniques, and generally outperformed MSWEPv2.2. The merged P products showed improvements in the linear correlation, bias, and variability of precipitation at different temporal scales, as well as in the probability of detection, the false alarm ratio, the frequency bias, and the critical success index for different precipitation intensities. RF-MEP performed well even when the training dataset was reduced to 10% of the available rain gauges. Our results suggest that RF-MEP could be successfully applied to any other region and to correct other climatological variables, assuming that ground-based data are available. An R package to implement RF-MEP is freely available online at https://github.com/hzambran/RFmerge.",

      "abstract": "Gridded precipitation datasets are becoming a convenient substitute for gauge measurements in hydrological modeling; however, these data have not been fully evaluated across a range of conditions. We compared four gridded datasets (Daily Surface Weather and Climatological Summaries [DAYMET], North American Land Data Assimilation System [NLDAS], Global Land Data Assimilation System [GLDAS], and Parameter‐elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model [PRISM]) as precipitation data sources and evaluated how they affected hydrologic model performance when compared with a gauged dataset, Global Historical Climatology Network‐Daily (GHCN‐D). Analyses were performed for the Delaware Watershed at Perry Lake in eastern Kansas. Precipitation indices for DAYMET and PRISM precipitation closely matched GHCN‐D, whereas NLDAS and GLDAS showed weaker correlations. We also used these precipitation data as input to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model that confirmed similar trends in streamflow simulation. For stations with complete data, GHCN‐D based SWAT‐simulated streamflow variability better than gridded precipitation data. During low flow periods we found PRISM performed better, whereas both DAYMET and NLDAS performed better in high flow years. Our results demonstrate that combining gridded precipitation sources with gauge‐based measurements can improve hydrologic model performance, especially for extreme events.",

      "citations": 180,
      "abstract": "Hydrological model calibration combining Earth observations and in situ measurements is a promising solution to overcome the limitations of the traditional streamflow‐only calibration. However, combining multiple data sources in model calibration requires a meaningful integration of the data sets, which should harness their most reliable contents to avoid accumulation of their uncertainties and mislead the parameter estimation procedure. This study analyzes the improvement of model parameter selection by using only the spatial patterns of satellite remote sensing data, thereby ignoring their absolute values. Although satellite products are characterized by uncertainties, their most reliable key feature is the representation of spatial patterns, which is a unique and relevant source of information for distributed hydrological models. We propose a novel multivariate calibration framework exploiting spatial patterns and simultaneously incorporating streamflow and three satellite products (i.e., Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model [GLEAM] evaporation, European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative [ESA CCI] soil moisture, and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment [GRACE] terrestrial water storage). The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature data set is used for model evaluation. A bias‐insensitive and multicomponent spatial pattern matching metric is developed to formulate a multiobjective function. The proposed multivariate calibration framework is tested with the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM) and applied to the poorly gauged Volta River basin located in a predominantly semiarid climate in West Africa. Results of the multivariate calibration show that the decrease in performance for streamflow (−7%) and terrestrial water storage (−6%) is counterbalanced with an increase in performance for soil moisture (+105%) and evaporation (+26%). These results demonstrate that there are benefits in using satellite data sets, when suitably integrated in a robust model parametrization scheme.",

      "abstract": "Since several datasets are available with marked differences, the assessment of precipitation data is a key aspect to support the choice of the most adequate precipitation product for a certain research or operational application. In the present study, we evaluated the use of the daily rainfall dataset from CHIRPS with spatial resolution of 0.05° for different purposes in the states of the Brazilian Legal Amazon. We compared monthly rainfall, annual rainfall indices and their trends calculated using CHIRPS data and rain gauge observations with a point-to-pixel analysis. The use of daily CHIRPS data provided mean monthly rainfall similar to that obtained using data from the rain gauge stations, but CHIRPS data tend to underestimate the values for the rainiest months. The correlation was usually lower in the western Amazon, especially during its rainy season. The same underestimation was observed for extreme rainfall indices. CHIRPS product produces more similar results to rain gauge data for the indices PRCPTOT, nP, and R95pad, while strong underestimate the most extreme rainfall indices (R50mm, Rx1day, Rx5days). For the 45 stations and 15 rainfall indices analysed, 63 significant trends were detected using rain gauge data, of which only 13 were detected using CHIRPS product. Therefore, the use of CHIRPS data does not well represent the trends in rainfall indices.",

      "abstract": "This study evaluates the univariate and bivariate characteristics of five gridded products with respect to the Adjusted and Homogenized Canadian Climate Data for 1980–2010. Spatial variations of temperature and precipitation biases including the ones corresponding to the magnitude and frequency of extremes are assessed over Canada. The dependence structure between the two variables is analysed across each dataset using a goodness of fit test based on copulas. The propagation of univariate and bivariate biases into streamflow simulations is then investigated by driving a semi-distributed hydrological model for three watersheds with distinct characteristics in western Canada. The input data include original (unadjusted) and bias-corrected climate data based on the univariate quantile delta mapping and multivariate bias correction approaches. The univariate analyses show that all datasets have relatively significant cold and wet biases to the west of the Rocky Mountains and hot and dry biases over the Prairies. Bivariate evaluations using copulas show that all products fail to capture the dependence structure between temperature and precipitation at the majority of the locations, which can undermine their suitability for compound event assessments. The differences between univariate and multivariate bias correction approaches are highlighted by the significant differences in the interrelationships between precipitation and temperature. Hydrological modelling results show major improvements in the detection of extremes after correcting the bivariate biases of the input datasets.",

      "abstract": "Accuracy assessment of precipitation retrievals is a pre-requisite for many hydrological studies as it helps to understand the source and the magnitude of the uncertainty in hydrological response variables, particularly over regions with complex topography. This study evaluates GPM IMERGv05, TMPA 3B42V7, ERA-Interim, and ERA5 precipitation products using 256 ground-based gauge stations between 2014 and 2018 over Turkey known to have complex topography and varying climate. Error statistics, categorical performance indices, and intensity-frequency distribution of the precipitation products are investigated over varying wetness and terrain slope classes. Results show that while the monthly correlation coefficient averaged over all the products is 0.79 for regions having slopes between 5 and 10%, this value drops to 0.74 when the slope is above 15%. IMERG, TMPA and ERA-Interim products underestimate the observed precipitation over relatively wetter regions, while they overestimate over relatively drier regions and relatively higher slopes. ERA5 consistently overestimates the observed precipitation over all the wetness and slope classes. Overall, TMPA shows the smallest wet bias (0.1 mm/day), while ERA5 has the largest wet bias (0.5 mm/day). IMERG has the highest monthly correlation (i.e., 0.82 when averaged for all 256 stations) and ERA-Interim has the lowest correlation (0.77) against the ground-based observations. The successors (IMERG and ERA5) show smaller ErrSD and higher CC compared to their predecessors (TMPA and ERA-Interim) at both daily and monthly time scales. The results also show that the studied satellite-based products perform better in matching the frequency of daily precipitation intensities, whereas the studied model-based products perform better in terms of categorical performance indices for lighter precipitation events.",

      "abstract": "Precipitation estimation at a global scale is essential for global water cycle simulation and water resources management. The precipitation estimation from gauge‐based, satellite retrieval, and reanalysis data sets has heterogeneous uncertainties for different areas at global land. Here, the 13 monthly precipitation data sets and the 11 daily precipitation data sets are analyzed to examine the relative uncertainty of individual data based on the developed generalized three‐cornered hat (TCH) method. The generalized TCH method can be used to evaluate the uncertainty of multiple (>3) precipitation products in an iterative optimization process. A weighting scheme is designed to merge the individual precipitation data sets to generate a new weighted precipitation using the inverse error variance‐covariance matrix of TCH estimated uncertainty. The weighted precipitation is then validated using gauged data with the minimal uncertainty among all the individual products. The merged results indicate the superiority of the weighted precipitation with substantially reduced random errors over individual data sets and a state‐of‐the‐art multisatellite merged product, namely, the Integrated Multi‐Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement at validated areas. The weighted data set can largely reproduce the interannual and seasonal variations of regional precipitation. The TCH‐based merging results outperform two other mean‐based merging methods at both monthly and daily scales. Overall, the merging scheme based on the generalized TCH method is effective to produce a new precipitation data set integrating information from multiple products for hydrometeorological applications.",

      "citations": 16,
      "abstract": "Over the past two decades, various satellite‐based precipitation products have been released to provide uninterrupted time‐series precipitation with quasi‐global coverage. The latest Chinese merged satellite–gauge (CMS) rainfall product developed by the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) may reduce the errors in near real time by combining the Climate Prediction Centre's (CPC) morphing algorithm (CMORPH) rainfall estimates with over 30,000 weather station measurements, which therefore offer a potential alternative or supplement to ground‐based rainfall estimates for hydrometeorological applications in sparsely gauged or ungauged basins. In the present study, the characteristics of the CMS precipitation product were comprehensively evaluated for the period 2008–2012 over Danjiangkou basin, central China, and used to drive the Liuxihe (LXH)‐distributed hydrological model for detailed streamflow simulations. The results show that most of the small–median rainfall with an intensity < 25 mm·day –1 can be well captured by the CMS, and the simulated streamflow had relatively better agreement with observations for peak flow in the lower part of the basin. However, the total water amount was 15.7% less than the streamflow driven by rain gauges, on average. In addition, the depths of surface flow and groundwater forced by the CMS rainfall were 22.05% and 21.10% less than rain gauge, respectively. Overall, the study provides new insight into and experience of the hydrological applicability of the high spatiotemporal‐resolution satellite–gauge rainfall product for driving a distributed hydrological model at a daily resolution. This product has the potential to be an alternative data source for data‐sparse or ungauged basins for water resource management and hydrological simulation/prediction purposes.",

      "abstract": "Satellite-based precipitation data can be a valuable source for performing hydro-climatological analyses: such as drought and water balance estimations with long and temporally consistent data. In this study, the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) precipitation estimations were compared with station-based precipitation measurements at daily, dekadal, and monthly time scales using statistical and categorical validation measures. The assessment study includes 77 ground-based meteorological stations distributed throughout Turkey, and the study period corresponds to years 2008 through 2018. Overall evaluation indicates that CHIRPS estimates exhibit high correlation on dekadal and monthly time scales; however correlation decreases for daily estimates. A positive bias is found over Turkey, and a particular overestimation was detected between the precipitation amounts of 0–25 mm/dekad and 0–80 mm/month. CHIRPS tends to underestimate high precipitation amounts of 25–80 mm/dekad and 150–300 mm/month. CHIRPS estimations show the best performance in winter when Turkey’s precipitation regime is dominated by cyclones and the lowest performance in the spring season. The study area was delineated into six regions according to their precipitation climatology and hydrological basins borders. The best performance for monthly CHIRPS estimates was in western Anatolia ( r = 0.88). For all regions, precipitation detection capability is significantly high not only for monthly but also for dekadal CHIRPS estimates. Probability of detection was found between 0.83 and 0.98, and the false alarm rate changes between 0.30 and 0.13 for the thresholds of 50 mm/month and 5 mm/month, respectively. In rainfall categories of 30, 40, and 50 mm / month the capacity to determine rain and no rain was significantly high. CHIRPS estimations for 54 meteorological stations were reasonably biased (between ± 20%) with ground-based observations. Results show that CHIRPS estimations over Western Anatolia, Southern Anatolia, and Marmara regions are more consistent than the mountainous eastern and northeastern parts of the country. CHIRPS estimates can be used for hydro-climatological studies such as drought and water balance modeling over Turkey considering the error characteristics presented in this study.",

      "citations": 18,
      "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the hydrologic applicability of an error correction method – SREM2D (two-dimensional stochastic satellite rainfall error model) to three satellite precipitation products in streamflow simulations. Three satellite precipitation products, including the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multiple-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) real-time 3B42 product (3B42RT), the Climate Prediction Centre (CPC) morphing technique (CMORPH) gauge merged product (CMORPH BLD), and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Network – Climate Data Record (PERSIANN CDR), are corrected using SREM2D. Over the upper Huaihe river basin, streamflow ensemble simulations are derived by forcing the distributed Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model with the SREM2D-based rainfall ensemble. After applying SREM2D to satellite precipitation products, the streamflow simulations forced by TMPA 3B42RT and PERSIANN CDR rainfall ensembles are capable to capture flood peaks. However, the streamflow simulations forced by CMORPH BLD rainfall ensemble show poor performance for the extreme events, but exhibit good accuracy in non-flood flow simulation. The calibration of the model over the headwater subbasin betters the streamflow simulation, especially for reproducing extreme events during the main flood cases. Overall, SREM2D provides great potential to facilitate the application of satellite precipitation products in water management and decision making over Chinese river basins.",

      "abstract": "Quality satellite-derived precipitation products (SPPs) are needed for water resources inventories and management, particularly in poorly gauged regions around the world. The latest version of five SPPs were assessed against SILO (Scientific Information for Land Owners) gauge-based gridded precipitation dataset in Australia over a 5-year period from October 2014 to September 2019. The evaluation was carried out using a 0.50° grid at daily, seasonal, and annual temporal scales. The assessed SPPs were the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) (IMERG), TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), Climate Prediction Centre (CPC) MORPHing technique (CMORPH), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), and PERSIANN-CDR (Climate Data Record). PERSIANN does not include any ground-based observations for bias-correction, while the other four products are bias-corrected against gauge-based data. Bias ratio and correlation coefficient for the five SPPs showed that the overall performance of IMERG and TMPA was better than that of CMORPH, PERSIANN, and PERSIANN-CDR for Australia. Seasonal analysis showed that IMERG had the better skill in winter. Overall, IMERG appeared to be the best SPP for Australia. However, TMPA also performed reasonably well, considering the climatological calibration implemented recently in the precipitation processing algorithm. The Structural Similarity Index (SSI), a map comparison technique using a moving window-based approach, was used to compare similarities between a pair of gridded precipitation maps in terms of local mean, variance, and covariance. All the SPPs showed discrepancies in the spatial structure of the mean annual precipitation, predominantly over some high precipitation areas in Australia. These local scale differences were not detectable in conventional cell by cell comparison or simply by visual inspection. Therefore, SSI could be an effective method to evaluate satellite precipitation estimation algorithm.",

      "abstract": "A new precipitation dataset is provided since 2014 by the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite constellation measurements combined in the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) algorithm. This recent GPM-IMERG dataset provides potentially useful precipitation data for regions with a low density of rain gauges. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of the near real-time product (IMERG-E) compared to observed rainfall and its suitability for hydrological modeling over a mountainous watershed in Morocco, the Ghdat located upstream the city of Marrakech. Several statistical indices have been computed and a hydrological model has been driven with IMERG-E rainfall to estimate its suitability to simulate floods during the period from 2011 to 2018. The following results were obtained: (1) Compared to the rain gauge data, satellite precipitation data overestimates rainfall amounts with a relative bias of +35.61% (2) In terms of the precipitation detection capability, the IMERG-E performs better at reproducing the different precipitation statistics at the catchment scale, rather than at the pixel scale (3) The flood events can be simulated with the hydrological model using both the observed and the IMERG-E satellite precipitation data with a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0.58 and 0.71, respectively. The results of this study indicate that the GPM-IMERG-E precipitation estimates can be used for flood modeling in semi-arid regions such as Morocco and provide a valuable alternative to ground-based precipitation measurements.",

      "abstract": "Reanalysis precipitation products are important datasets for precipitation estimates over ungauged areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the newly released fifth-generation reanalysis product of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), i.e., ERA5, for precipitation estimates over Chinese Mainland during 2003–2015. In this study, we evaluated the ERA5 reanalysis data using gridded gauge precipitation. Both categorical and continuous verification scores were calculated. The results show that the detection capacity of ERA5 varies across the four sub-regions of Chinese Mainland. ERA5 tends to misdetect daily precipitation events in the south of the northwestern arid climate (NAC) and north of plateau climate (PC) zones. In addition, it is more difficult for ERA5 to accurately detect moderate or higher daily precipitation events (above 10 mm/day). Error analysis show that ERA5 product has higher root mean-square error (RMSE) values in the tropical and subtropical climate zone (TSC) with a relatively wet climate. Compared to satellite-based precipitation product, ERA5 has larger relative biases in precipitation estimates over Chinese Mainland and it tends to over- and underestimate light precipitation events and moderate and heavy precipitation events, respectively. Based on the analysis of the accuracy of ERA5 during typhoon-induced extreme precipitation, ERA5 can identify the precipitation distribution and center, but underestimates extreme precipitation. Overall, the results of this study provide references for the use of ERA5 in hydrological applications over Chinese Mainland.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Research",
      "citations": 7,
      "abstract": "Enforcing terrestrial water budget closure is critical for obtaining consistent data sets of budget components to understand the changes and availability of water resources over time. However, most existing budget closure correction methods (BCCs) are significantly affected by errors in the budget‐component products. Moreover, these existing BCCs do not fully account for the preselection of high‐precision input data sets before enforcing the water budget closure, resulting in uncertainties in the budget‐corrected data sets. In this study, a two‐step method was proposed to enforce the water budget closure of satellite‐based hydrological products. First, high‐precision budget‐component data sets were selected and second, the water budget closure of the selected high‐precision data sets was then enforced by proposing an improved BCC strategy, that is, the Minimized Series Deviation method (MSD). The performance of the proposed two‐step method was verified in 24 global basins by comparing it to three existing BCCs of varying complexity, that is, Proportional Redistribution (PR), Constrained Kalman Filter (CKF), and Multiple Collocation (MCL). The results showed that compared to the existing BCCs, the proposed two‐step method significantly improved the accuracy of budget‐corrected data sets in the range of 2%–19% (statistical analysis was based root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) with estimated observation (EO) as a reference). This study also summarized the main factors influencing the performance of the existing BCCs and their further development prospects based on the results. This provides insight into the expansion of theories and methods related to closing the terrestrial water budget.",

      "citations": 15,
      "abstract": "A long-term database with information on precipitation, discharge and sediment yield dynamics was analyzed to characterize the temporal structure response of a catchment in a humid mountain badland area. Due to the non-linearity and non-stationary nature of the data, a combination of frequency analysis and wavelet reconstruction techniques were initially used to determine the dominant time scales of the precipitation, discharge and sediment yield. Within the full spectrum of time scales, the spectral frequency analysis could distinguish the dominant ones governing the overall trend of the time-series. Furthermore, the temporal multiresolution wavelet technique enabled accurate de-noising of the hydrometric and sediment time-series, by filtering out the high frequency intermittent processes superimposed on the main signal. Geomorphological metrics were subsequently applied to the filtered data and link to the temporal structure of the catchment response. The combined frequency-geomorphological analysis provides a physical explanation of the complete temporal structure of the catchment response to precipitation. This analysis features components from intra-annual, annual and multi-year scales. Intra-annual and annual time scales are led by climatological characteristics of the catchment site (seasonal rainfall patterns of a mountain Pyrenean catchment). The multi-year response related to the sediment yield reveals the importance of the sediment storage/depletion cycle in the catchment: although the main driver of the sediment yield is the discharge, weathering processes and sediment storage are also major control factors. Therefore, correct management of the catchment requires the combined multi-temporal response of water and sediment fluxes to be controlled. The temporal spectral analysis herein outlined provides a detailed analysis of the long-term temporal structure of databases and can be accepted as an adequate tool for catchment management in terms of flood forecasting or reservoir operation.",

      "abstract": "Measured records of suspended sediment concentrations are vital information to support water management activities. However, these measured time series are often incomplete and, as such, are not suitable for some analyses. This paper sets out the options for modelling suspended sediment concentrations to determine them in periods when measurements were not performed. The Danube River profile in Bratislava was selected as the case study. Regression using least absolute selection and shrinkage operator, support vector regression and deep learning neural network are compared in the paper to solve this task using various data sources. The results obtained show a significant increase in the precision of modelling suspended sediment concentrations over the standard method, which is a rating curve. Several variables were used to establish the suspended sediment concentration, because the same data as in this study may not be available everywhere. In particular, the use of climatic (precipitation and temperature) and hydrological inputs (flows) is assessed in order to promote the more general benefit of work. In the article, the authors propose an original method of modification of input climate data, which significantly increases the accuracy of modelling. The authors demonstrate that when using proposed methodology, the use of climate data, which are usually better available than hydrological data, resulted in a comparable degree of precision to standard modelling based on river flow data.",

      "journal": "International Soil and Water Conservation Research",
      "citations": 18,
      "abstract": "Soil erosion is one of the most serious environmental issues, especially in vulnerable areas such as the Pisha sandstone regions located in the Loess Plateau (China). In these types of reliefs, long-term studies monitoring runoff and soil loss are scarce, and even more considering the efficiency of different soil management techniques applied to reduce land degradation. In this study, seven years (2014-2020) of in-situ measurements of surface runoff and soil loss for different land uses (forestland, shrubland, grassland, farmland, and bare land) in a Pisha Sandstone environment at the Loess Plateau were conducted. We applied the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model combining the large database with the precipitation regimes. Our results showed that runoff volume coming from observed and simulated data exhibited significant differences among them depending on the different vegetation types. Runoff and soil loss were different among diverse land use types as follows: farmland > grassland > shrubland > forestland. After conducting a calibration, we found satisfactorily simulated surface runoff and sediment yield based on precipitation regimes and land uses at sandstone reliefs. Simulation performance of surface runoff was better than sediment yield. The range of standard error of the model simulation for event and annual values of runoff were 4.71 mm and 12.19 mm, respectively. The standard error for event and annual values of soil loss were 4.19 t/hm2 and 21.86 t/hm2. In the calibration group, R2 of runoff and soil loss were 0.92 and 0.86 respectively, while Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (E) reached 0.90 and 0.85, respectively. In the validation group, the R2 for both runoff and soil loss were 0.82 and 0.56, respectively. Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (E) were 0.77 and 0.54 for the runoff and sediment yield. We concluded that using a detailed monitoring dataset, the WEPP model could accurately simulate and predict water erosion in the hillslopes of Pisha sandstone area.",

      "abstract": "As a major contributor of land degradation, water borne soil erosion poses a threat to environmental and socioeconomic sustainability worldwide. Recently, various anthropogenic factors have aggravated soil erosion related problems in most of the humid and semi arid parts of the developing countries like India. Therefore, accurate quantification of the spatially distributed soil erosion along with the identification of erosion hot spots is of paramount significance for designing extensive management strategies to combat erosion hazard. The present study aimed to estimate mean annual soil loss in a tropical river basin such as Kumari river basin (KRB, area: 195125 ha) in the Chotanagpur plateau region in India. In addition, the study also quantified mean sediment yield and identified the main sediment sources within the basin. For these purposes, the present study introduced a raster based spatially distributed approach that integrated RUSLE and sediment delivery ratio (SDR) models with remote sensing (RS) and GIS. The results depicted that annual soil loss within the basin varied from 0 to 208.34 t ha - 1 yr - 1 with an average of 1.92 t ha - 1 yr - 1. The computed annual soil loss was about 364.05 × 103 tonnes, of these, 209.46 × 103 (∼58 %) were lost from only 8.93 % of the total basin area at intolerable rate. Similarly, the estimated sediment yield within the basin ranged from 0 to 64.53 t ha - 1 yr - 1 with a mean of 1.15 t ha - 1 yr - 1 and followed a similar distribution pattern of soil erosion. Being characterized by steep topography, the forest patches in the upstream part of the basin showed the most critical erosion risk. The methodology adopted in the current research displayed acceptable correctness and enabled spotting of most vulnerable areas of water erosion and critical sediment sources, initiating a comprehensive anticipating aid for the implementation of proper land management and soil conservation plans. This perspective is surmised to be helpful for extensive study of water erosion in other tropical river basins.",

The result shows that the STEP model functions satisfactorily at monthly and annual time window in the calibration and validation periods. In both periods, the STEP model is able to produce fruitful annual sediment transport rates with R2 values of 0.71 and 0.9 in the calibration and validation period respectively. Moreover, the STEP model exhibits more equitable spatial variability than that of the widely known USLE model. Correspondingly, it can be surmised that the STEP model is capable of simulating spatial and temporal variability of sediment transport from a watershed at monthly and annual time scales.",

      "abstract": "The precise prediction of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) is of great importance for river reservoir construction planning, water resource management, and ecological environment restoration. This research aims to improve SSC prediction accuracy by constructing a comprehensive and integrated deep learning model Wavelet-MGGP-CNN-LSTM (ICNN-LSTM), combining wavelet transformation (WT), multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) simultaneously. In ICNN-LSTM, the WT decomposes the signal and extracts time and frequency domain information, while the MGGP filters out redundant information. Then, the CNN and LSTM are integrated in a parallel and loosely coupled manner to form an initial combined model CNN-LSTM (CNN combined with LSTM) to process filtered information by WT and MGGP. Furthermore, this study compares the performance of ICNN-LSTM with CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM, ICNN (CNN embedded with WT and MGGP), ILSTM (LSTM embedded with WT and MGGP), artificial neural network (ANN), and the traditional sediment rating curve (SRC). The evaluation of prediction accuracy for all models was conducted using root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSC), coefficient of determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE) as performance indicators. The daily discharge and suspended sediment concentration series data from Tangnaihai Hydrological Station in the upper reaches of the Yellow River spanning from 1977 to 1987 were selected to train and test the models. Results show that, first, deep learning networks such as CNN and LSTM outperform the shallow neural network ANN, with LSTM providing higher accuracy than CNN. Second, the CNN-LSTM hybrid outperforms both CNN and LSTM models, exhibiting a nearly 89% improvement in NSC value compared to SRC in the test phase. Third, deep learning models such as ICNN, ILSTM, and ICNN-LSTM show significantly higher NSC values than CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM models in the test phase, with improvements of 13.8%, 5.7%, and 12.1%, respectively. Moreover, compared to SRC, the proposed ICNN-LSTM model improves NSC value by nearly 140% in the test phase. The proposed ICNN-LSTM model, integrating the advantages of WT, deep learning, and ensemble learning, provides accurate and reliable predictions and serves as a reference for time series prediction modeling.",

In this work, we present a systematic framework to construct and validate highly accurate meta-models to perform an efficient GSA of complex WWTP models such as the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 2 (BSM2).

      "abstract": "Dynamical environmental systems models are highly parameterized, having large numbers of parameters whose values are uncertain. For spatially distributed continental‐scale applications, such models must be run for very large numbers of grid locations. To calibrate such models, it is useful to be able to perform parameter screening, via sensitivity analysis, to identify the most important parameters. However, since this typically requires the models to be run for a large number of sampled parameter combinations, the computational burden can be huge. To make such an investigation computationally feasible, we propose a novel approach to combining spatial sampling with parameter sampling and test it for the Noah‐MP land surface model applied across the continental United States, focusing on gross primary production and flux of latent heat simulations for two vegetation types. Our approach uses (a) progressive Latin hypercube sampling to sample at four grid levels and four parameter levels, (b) a recently developed grouping‐based sensitivity analysis approach that ranks parameters by importance group rather than individually, and (c) a measure of robustness to grid and parameter sampling variability. The results show that a relatively small grid sample size (i.e., 5% of the total grids) and small parameter sample size (i.e., 5 times the number of parameters) are sufficient to identify the most important parameters, with very high robustness to grid sampling variability and a medium level of robustness to parameter sampling variability. The results ensure a dramatic reduction in computational costs for such studies.",

      "abstract": "The search for new and more efficient global sensitivity analysis methods has led to the development of the PAWN distribution-based method. This method has been proven to overcome one of the main limitation of variance-based methods – the moment independent property. In this regard, the distribution-based method has outperformed the variance-based method for some highly-skewed or multi-modal distributions. However, despite its increasing popularity, there is a lack of understanding about the performance and properties of the distribution-based method. The benchmark presented in this paper is an attempt to remedy this. We compare the distribution-based method against the variance-based method for a set of well-known test functions. We show that, whereas the distribution-based method can be used as a complementary approach to variance-based methods, which is especially useful when dealing with highly-skewed or multi-modal distributions, it fails to rank different inputs that have different orders of magnitude in their contribution of the response.",

      "abstract": "Based on the theoretical framework for sensitivity analysis called “Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces” (VARS), developed in the companion paper, we develop and implement a practical “star-based” sampling strategy (called STAR-VARS), for the application of VARS to real-world problems. We also develop a bootstrap approach to provide confidence level estimates for the VARS sensitivity metrics and to evaluate the reliability of inferred factor rankings. The effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of STAR-VARS are demonstrated via two real-data hydrological case studies (a 5-parameter conceptual rainfall-runoff model and a 45-parameter land surface scheme hydrology model), and a comparison with the “derivative-based” Morris and “variance-based” Sobol approaches are provided. Our results show that STAR-VARS provides reliable and stable assessments of “global” sensitivity across the full range of scales in the factor space, while being 1-2 orders of magnitude more efficient than the Morris or Sobol approaches.",

      "abstract": "Parametric sensitivity analysis (SA) is an essential tool in optical data analysis aiming to quantify the relative importance of optical model parameters and identify those with a low influence which should remain fixed during analysis in order to simplify a model. Typically, such sensitivity studies are performed using a local sensitivity analysis, also referred to as “one-at-a-time” analysis, which estimates parameter sensitivity by evaluating the changes in model output while perturbing one parameter at a time and holding all other parameters fixed. All the pitfalls of the local sensitivity approach are quite obvious and well known; however, local SA is still prevailing in the area of data analysis for spectroscopic ellipsometry. In this study, we discuss applications of a global qualitative analysis introduced by Morris in 1991 which determines an overall significance for each model parameter and describes its nonlinear effect on model’s output and/or interactions with other parameters. The Morris method allows effective separation of the model parameters into different groups such as parameters with negligible effects, parameters with large linear effects without interactions, and parameters with large nonlinear and/or interaction effects. Here, we carried out the Morris sensitivity analysis to reveal the model parameter significance ranking in a test case of the B-spline model for titanium nitride (TiN). Such a screening approach can be considered as a practical tool for the initial global SA strategy prior to true “all-at-a-time” global sensitivity analysis.",

      "citations": 15,
      "abstract": "For many engineering problems, it is important to know which random input variables have significant influence on relevant outputs, since, for example, these inputs are of special interest in optimisation tasks or their uncertainty can significantly influence the structural reliability. For the identification of influential inputs, sensitivity analyses can be used. Sobol’ indices are an accurate sensitivity measure for non-linear problems. However, for most structural engineering problems with high computing times per model evaluation, standard calculation procedures of Sobol’ indices using random sampling (e.g. Monte Carlo) are conditionally suitable. That is why stochastic expansion methods for the computation of Sobol’ indices have been developed recently. Especially for low-dimensional problems, these methods have the ability to significantly reduce the number of function evaluations compared to standard sampling approaches. In this work, a two-step approach consisting of a meta-model-based dimensional reduction and a subsequent calculation of Sobol’ indices using stochastic collocation is proposed to extend this ability to medium-dimensional engineering problems with arbitrary input distributions. The efficiency of the proposed approach is verified using several analytical examples. More complex applications from the field of wind energy engineering are used to demonstrate the practical relevance and the benefits in, for example, structural reliability engineering.",

      "abstract": "Monte Carlo (MC) methods have been widely used in uncertainty analysis and parameter identification for hydrological models. The main challenge with these approaches is, however, the prohibitive number of model runs required to get an adequate sample size which may take from days to months especially when the simulations are run in distributed mode. In the past, emulators have been used to minimize the computational burden of the MC simulation through direct estimation of the residual based response surfaces. Here, we apply emulators of MC simulation in parameter identification for a distributed conceptual hydrological model using two likelihood measures, i.e. the absolute bias of model predictions (Score) and another based on the time relaxed limits of acceptability concept (pLoA). Three machine learning models (MLMs) were built using model parameter sets and response surfaces with limited number of model realizations (4000). The developed MLMs were applied to predict pLoA and Score for a large set of model parameters (95 000). The behavioural parameter sets were identified using a time relaxed limits of acceptability approach based on the predicted pLoA values; and applied to estimate the quantile streamflow predictions weighted by their respective Score. The three MLMs were able to adequately mimic the response surfaces directly estimated from MC simulations; and the models identified using the coupled ML emulators and the limits of acceptability approach have performed very well in reproducing the median streamflow prediction both during the calibration and validation periods.",

This method is evaluated on two mathematical test functions (Ishigami and Sobol’ G) and two hydrologic models (HBV-SASK and SAC-SMA). Our results show the SPC method needs about a sample size of 30 to 70 times the number of dimensions of the parameter space to evaluate the interaction effects of hydrologic models.

      "abstract": "In this study, we evaluate uncertainties propagated through different climate data sets in seasonal and annual hydrological simulations over 10 subarctic watersheds of northern Manitoba, Canada, using the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model. Further, we perform a comprehensive sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the VIC model using a robust and state‐of‐the‐art approach. The VIC model simulations utilize the recently developed variogram analysis of response surfaces (VARS) technique that requires in this application more than 6,000 model simulations for a 30‐year (1981–2010) study period. The method seeks parameter sensitivity, identifies influential parameters, and showcases streamflow sensitivity to parameter uncertainty at seasonal and annual timescales. Results suggest that the Ensemble VIC simulations match observed streamflow closest, whereas global reanalysis products yield high flows (0.5–3.0 mm day −1 ) against observations and an overestimation (10–60%) in seasonal and annual water balance terms. VIC parameters exhibit seasonal importance in VARS, and the choice of input data and performance metrics substantially affect sensitivity analysis. Uncertainty propagation due to input forcing selection in each water balance term (i.e., total runoff, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration) is examined separately to show both time and space dimensionality in available forcing data at seasonal and annual timescales. Reliable input forcing, the most influential model parameters, and the uncertainty envelope in streamflow prediction are presented for the VIC model. These results, along with some specific recommendations, are expected to assist the broader VIC modelling community and other users of VARS and land surface schemes, to enhance their modelling applications.",

      "abstract": "Abstracts Environmental models have a key role to play in understanding complex environmental phenomena in space and time. Although their inherent uncertainty and non-identifiability are being increasingly recognized with the development and application of various methods, a more holistic analysis of all sources of model uncertainty is warranted. This paper addresses sources of uncertainty from various types of input datasets and model parameters, including those related to model structure assumptions, using a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) application for the Minjiang River watershed, China. The holistic uncertainty sources in the SWAT application are summarized, and a sensitivity analysis (SA) is applied to examine the relative importance of the uncertainty sources influencing average streamflow and the load of nitrate. The analysis reveals that uncertainties related to the stream network precision and certain SWAT parameters are the most critical factors. Furthermore, building upon our SA framework to consider uncertainty sources more holistically would provide a good starting point for subsequent SA of spatially distributed environmental models in general.",

      "citations": 24,
      "abstract": "The complex terrain, seasonality, and cold region hydrology of the Nelson Churchill River Basin (NCRB) presents a formidable challenge for hydrological modeling, which complicates the calibration of model parameters. Seasonality leads to different hydrological processes dominating at different times of the year, which translates to time variant sensitivity in model parameters. In this study, Hydrological Predictions for the Environment model (HYPE) is set up in the NCRB to analyze the time variant sensitivity analysis (TVSA) of model parameters using a Global Sensitivity Analysis technique known as Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces (VARS). TVSA can identify parameters that are highly influential in a short period but relatively uninfluential over the whole simulation period. TVSA is generally effective in identifying model’s sensitivity to event-based parameters related to cold region processes such as snowmelt and frozen soil. This can guide event-based calibration, useful for operational flood forecasting. In contrast to residual based metrics, flow signatures, specifically the slope of the mid-segment of the flow duration curve, allows VARS to detect the influential parameters throughout the timescale of analysis. The results are beneficial for the calibration process in complex and multi-dimensional models by targeting the informative parameters, which are associated with the cold region hydrological processes.",

      "abstract": "Process-based hydrologic models allow to identify the behavior of a basin providing a mathematical description of the hydrologic processes underlying the runoff mechanisms that govern the streamflow generation. This study focuses on a macroscale application of the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model over 31 headwater subwatersheds belonging to the Duero River Basin, located in the Iberian Peninsula, through a three-part approach: (1) the calibration and evaluation of the VIC model performance for all the subwatersheds; (2) an integrated sensitivity analysis concerning the soil parameters chosen for the calibration, and (3) an assessment of equifinality and the efficiency of the calibration algorithm. The temporal evaluation of the model was done for the calibration and the subsequent validation periods, and showed good results for most of the subwatersheds that largely improved the benchmark performance. The spatial performance reflected a high transferability for most parameter combinations, and the least transferable were related to subwatersheds located in the northern mountains. An additional evaluation of the simulated actual evapotranspiration produced satisfactory adjustments to two selected data products. The sensitivity measures were obtained with the Standardized Regression Coefficients method through a post-process of the outputs of a Monte Carlo simulation carried out for 10,000 parameter samples for each subwatershed. This allowed to quantify the sensitivity of the water balance components to the selected parameters for the calibration and understanding the strong dependencies between them. The final assessment of the equifinality hypothesis manifested that there are many parameter samples with performances as good as the optimum, calculated using the Shuffled-Complex-Evolution Algorithm. For almost all the analyzed subwatersheds the calibration algorithm resulted efficient, reaching the optimal fit. Both the Monte Carlo simulation and the use of a calibration algorithm will be of interest for other feasible applications of the VIC model in other river basins.",

As an example of its application, an analysis of hydrological model results in daily, monthly, and annual time windows is carried out. The results show that the model allows the time sensitivity of a model with respect to its parameters to be detected, making it a suitable tool for the assessment of temporal variability of processes in models that include time series analysis. In addition, it is observed that the size of the moving window can influence the estimated sensitivity; therefore, analysis of different time windows is recommended.",

      "citations": 35,
      "abstract": "Rainfall–runoff phenomena are among the main processes within the hydrological cycle. In urban zones, the increases in imperviousness cause increased runoff, originating floods. It is fundamental to know the sensitivity of parameters in the modeling of an urban basin, which makes the calibration process more efficient by allowing one to focus only on the parameters for which the modeling results are sensitive. This research presents a formal sensitivity analysis of hydrological and hydraulic parameters—absolute–relative, relative–absolute, relative–relative sensitivity and R 2 —applied to an urban basin. The urban basin of Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas, in Mexico is an area prone to flooding caused by extreme precipitation events. The basin has little information in which the records (with the same time resolution) of precipitation and hydrometry match. The basin model representing an area of 355.07 km 2 was characterized in the Stormwater Management Model (SWMM). The sensitivity analysis was performed for eight hydrological parameters and one hydraulic for two precipitation events and their impact on the depths of the Sabinal River. Based on the analysis, the parameters derived from the analysis that stand out as sensitive are the Manning coefficient of impervious surface and the minimum infiltration speed with R 2 > 0.60. The results obtained demonstrate the importance of knowing the sensitivity of the parameters and their selection to perform an adequate calibration.",

      "abstract": "Runoff and sediment yield predictions using rainfall-runoff modeling systems play a significant role in developing sustainable rangeland and water resource management strategies. To characterize the behavior and predictive uncertainty of the KINEROS2 physically-based distributed hydrologic model, we assessed model parameters importance at the event-scale for small nested semi-arid subwatersheds in southeastern Arizona using the Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces (VARS) methodology. A two-pronged approach using time-aggregate and time-variant parameter importance analysis was adopted to improve understanding of the control and behavior of models. The time-aggregate analysis looks at several signature responses, including runoff volume, sediment yield, peak runoff, runoff duration, time to peak, lag time, and recession duration, to investigate the influence of parameter and input on the model predictions. The time-variant analysis looks at the dynamical influence of parameters on the simulation of flow and sediment rates at every simulation time step using the different forcing inputs. This investigation was able to address Simpson’s paradox-type issues where the analysis across the different objective functions and full data set vs. its subsets (i.e., different events and/or time steps) could yield inconsistent and potentially misleading results. The results indicated the uncertainties in the flow responses are primarily due to the saturated hydraulic conductivity, the Manning’s coefficient, the soil capillary coefficient, and the cohesion in sediment and flow-related responses. The level of influence of K2 parameters depends on the type of the model response surface, the rainfall, and the watershed size.",

      "abstract": "Variance‐based analysis has emerged as method of choice for quantifying the sensitivity of the output, y , of a scalar‐valued square‐integrable function, f ∈ L 2 (), to its d ≥ 1 input variables, x = { x 1 , ..., x d }, with support . The prototype of this approach, Sobol's method is a generalization of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) to d > 2 independent input variables and decomposes y , as sum of elementary functions of zeroth‐, first‐, second‐, up to d th‐order. This independence assumption is mathematically convenient but may not be borne out of the causal or correlational relationships between the x 's. This paper is concerned with variance‐based sensitivity analysis (SA) for correlated input variables, for example, multivariate dependencies in a posterior parameter distribution. We use high‐dimensional model representation (HDMR) of Li et al. (2010, https://doi.org/10.1021/jp9096919), Li and Rabitz (2012, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10910-011-9898-0) and replace Sobol's elementary functions with so‐called component functions with unknown expansion coefficients to disentangle the structural, correlative and total contribution of input factors. We contrast the default HDMR methodology with cubic B‐splines and sequential coefficient estimation against its successor, HDMR ext of Li and Rabitz (2012, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10910-011-9898-0), which uses polynomial component functions with an extended orthonormalized basis. Benchmark experiments confirm that HDMR and HDMR ext parse out the structural and correlative contributions of input factors to the model output and infer an optimal experimental design with parameter correlation. Our last study applies HDMR ext to probabilistic SA of a watershed model. The multivariate posterior parameter distribution supports model emulation and yields sensitivity indices that pertain to measured discharge data.",

      "abstract": "Snow in mountainous regions is a key water resource from local to continental scales. However, the link between increasingly frequent snow droughts and socio-hydrologic impacts from headwaters to lowlands is not fully understood. To untangle this relationship, here we combine snow and climate reanalyses with a range of data of terrestrial water storage, streamflow, and emergency water-use restrictions for the archetypal 2022 snow drought in the Po basin (Italy). We find that a persistent high-pressure ridge during winter 2021-2022 translated into a −88% anomaly in peak snow water equivalent, intraseasonal snowmelt, and earlier melt-out dates. Compounded by reduced summer precipitation and importantly increased temperatures, this snow deficit led to the lowest terrestrial water storage on record in summer 2022. Emergency water-use restrictions were concurrent with the peak in snowmelt deficit in early summer, rather than the peak in precipitation deficit in mid-winter. This study highlights the contribution of snowmelt deficit in driving the 2022 socio-hydrologic drought in the Po Basin.",

      "abstract": "Seasonal snow-derived water is a critical component of the water supply in the mountains and downstream regions, and the accurate characterization of available water in the form of snow-water-equivalent (SWE), peak SWE, and snowmelt onset are essential inputs for water management efforts. Arising from recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), we introduce a large-scale ML SWE model leveraging publicly available data sources and open-source software. The model demonstrates the application of a limited feature space in a relatively simple ML architecture without the need for process-based formulations to effectively estimate spatially continuous SWE at a daily temporal resolution. Beginning with in situ SWE measurements (i.e., SNOTEL), lidar-derived terrain features, and temporal variables, we employ localized feature engineering and optimization via gradient-boosting decision trees to identify regionally unique drivers of snowpack dynamics and use the optimal features to train regionally independent artificial neural networks to estimate regional SWE at a 1 km spatial resolution. The model results yield respectable skill in reconstructed 1 km gridded SWE magnitudes in a hindcast simulation of the 2019 water year that is independent of the training and testing data. Comparing model estimates to over 6200 observations, the model demonstrates a weighted RMSE of 15.4 cm, Kling-Gupta Efficiency metric of 0.86, and a percent bias of 0.71% across 23 snow-influenced regions in the western U.S. The model simulation produces peak SWE estimates within 10 cm for twenty of the twenty-three regions, demonstrating capability in effectively capturing regional snow accumulation processes. The demonstration of low-error ML workflows capable of providing near-real-time, spatially continuous SWE estimates at a high spatial resolution provides proof-of-concept and a foundation to effectively update snow state variables that drive water supply forecasts in snow-dominated regions.",

Focusing on the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model as a case study, data preparation steps are sequenced using rules within iRODS. VIC and iRODS are applied to study hydrologic conditions in the Carolinas, USA during the period 1998–2007 to better understand impacts of drought within the region. The application demonstrates how iRODS can support hydrologic modelers to create more reproducible and extensible model-based analyses.",

To enhance computational efficiency, we developed two parallel versions of the model, one using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and the other using NVIDIA's CUDA code on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Evaluation of the speed-up and efficiency of the MPI version shows that the effect of input/output (IO) operations on the parallel model performance increases as the number of processor cores increases. As a result, although the computation kernel scales well with the number of cores, the efficiency of the parallel code as a whole degrades. The performance improves when the number of IO operations is reduced by reading/writing larger data arrays. The CUDA GPU implementation was done without major refactoring of the original UEB code, and tests demonstrated that satisfactory performance could be obtained without a major re-work of the existing UEB code.",

      "abstract": "Quantifying bacteria fluxes and contaminants from the point and nonpoint sources in a watershed are important for the management of water quality and safeguard public health. Therefore, the appropriate characterization of bacteria from different sources is necessary for understanding of fate and transport of bacteria in watersheds. However, it is challenging to simulate the effects of pH on bacteria, such as Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) in the original version of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). This study aimed to augment SWAT-bacteria module to evaluate the potential effect of pH on E. coli concentrations. We modified SWAT-bacteria module to incorporate pH factor and to check E. coli observations from four sites of Athabasca River Basin. The modified SWAT-bacteria model demonstrated a linear relationship between observed and simulated daily E. coli data with R 2 values found between 0.70 and 0.80; NSE: 0.59 and 0.68; PBIAS: 7.94% and 17.85% during calibration for all monitoring sites (2010–2012). While during the validation (2013–2014) the performance statistics found to be: R 2 : 0.59–0.72; NSE: 0.55–0.66; PBIAS: 10–22%. The results of the sensitivity analysis confirmed that pH is one of the most significant fate factors of E. coli . The modified SWAT-bacteria module provides an improved estimate of E. coli concentration from the river basin. This study contributes new insight to E. coli modelling. Therefore, the modified SWAT-bacteria model could be a powerful tool for the future regional to global scale model of E. coli concentrations thus significantly contribute for the application of effective river basin management.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a MATLAB framework for forecasting optimal flow releases in a multi-storage system for flood control. This framework combines four widely-used models intended for (1) performing hydrologic analysis for a watershed and for level-pool routing in the storage systems, (2) simulating river inundation, (3) solving the optimization problem of determining hourly optimal flow releases in a multi-storage system, and (4) data management and plotting. The integration of all software is performed in MATLAB, which is a state-of-the-art and an easy-to-use environment for integrating computation, visualization, and programming. This paper focuses on (1) presenting the MATLAB scripts for interfacing the aforementioned four software, (2) describing the rationale for the objective function of the optimization, and (3) demonstrating the practical use of the MATLAB framework by applying it to the operation of a hypothetical eight-pond system in the Cypress Creek watershed in Houston, Texas. The results of the aforementioned application show that this framework could help in mitigating flooding.",

Tools that automate and speed up input processing facilitate the application of these models. In this study, we developed a set of web-based data services called HydroDS to provide hydrologic data processing ‘software as a service.’ HydroDS provides functions for processing watershed, terrain, canopy, climate, and soil data. The services are accessed through a Python client library that facilitates developing simple but effective data processing workflows with Python. Evaluations of HydroDS by setting up the Utah Energy Balance and TOPNET models for multiple headwater watersheds in the Colorado River basin show that HydroDS reduces the input preparation time compared to manual processing. It also removes the requirements for software installation and maintenance by the user, and the Python workflows enhance reproducibility of hydrologic data processing and tracking of provenance.",

To overcome these limitations, we developed the EO Time Series Viewer, a free and open source QGIS plugin for user-friendly visualization, interpretation and labeling of multi-sensor TS data. The EO Time Series Viewer (i) combines advantages of spatial, spectral and temporal data visualization concepts that are so far not available in a single tool, (ii) provides maximum flexibility in terms of supported data formats, (iii) minimizes the user-interactions required to load and visualize multi-sensor TS data and (iv) speeds-up labeling of TS data based on enhanced GIS vector tools and formats.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 68,
      "abstract": "Evaluation of water resources systems and implementation of appropriate management strategies requires accurate and well classified information describing supply, demand, and consumption. The WA+ water accounting framework is a relevant tool in this regard. Earlier applications of the WA+ framework draw heavily from remote sensing (RS) data; however, applying RS data limits the application of the framework to past and current situations. Such analyses are needed for future assessments due to new management and climate scenarios. Therefore, the objective of this research is to link WA+ with the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to enhance it and to evaluate water management strategies through an integrated framework. The resulting system, SWAT-FARS (customized version of SWAT model for Fars region) is capable of supporting macro and micro water planning through a systematic presentation of the past trends, current and future status in water supply and demand. To explore this methodology, the system was applied to the Tashk-Bakhtegan basin (Iran). The trends in supply and consumption within the basin and some of the water saving policies that are mandated by the country’s 6th development plan were evaluated. Application of SWAT-FARS to the Task-Bakhtegan basin showed decrease in “Manageable water” of about 23% and a simultaneous increase of “Incremental irrigation” of about 53%; this lack of accessible water and imbalance of manageable water and water usage has almost omitted the basin’s “Outflows”. To alleviate pressures on the basin’s water resources, a suggested elimination of rice cultivation and improving pressurized irrigation showed the first policy could reduce water consumption by 0.08 BCM/yr and the second one can even increase water consumption by 0.25 BCM/yr over current conditions. The methodology used to develop SWAT-FARS is strongly recommended for other regions suffering water scarcity.",

      "journal": "Environmental Modelling & Software",
      "citations": 37,
      "abstract": "Computational models for natural hazards usually require a large number of input parameters that affect the model outcome in a complex manner. The sensitivity of the input parameters to the output variables can be quantified using sensitivity analysis, which provides insight into the key factors driving the model and can guide modeling optimization. However, performing a sensitivity analysis typically requires a large number of simulations, which can be prohibitively time-consuming on workstations or local servers. To address this issue, this study proposes a Cloud-based framework that takes advantage of scalable Cloud resources. The efficacy of the framework is demonstrated by the scalability achieved while running large-scale wildfire simulations. Moreover, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the input parameters used in these models is presented. The ability to efficiently perform sensitivity analysis using the framework could allow such analysis to be performed as an on-demand service for operational disaster management.",

A GUI is generally user-friendly for novice users but opens sources of irreproducible research. We illustrate that none of the 10 Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models over the Upper Blue Nile can easily be reproduced. Scripted workflows provide the ability to reproduce model set-ups, but they may be less user-friendly especially to novice users. We present a software (SWAT + AW) that promotes reproducible SWAT + model studies while remaining user-friendly for both novice and expert users. SWAT + AW uses a configuration file to create models that are compatible with GUI. We applied the workflow to the Blue Nile catchment and show that it yields the same results the SWAT + GUI. We conclude that such user-friendly scripted workflows enhance reproducibility, transparency and reusability of hydrological models.

      "abstract": "As the world becomes more urbanized and heavy precipitation events increase in frequency and intensity, urban (pluvial) flooding is an emerging concern. Recent advances in hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, high-resolution quantitative precipitation forecasting, and ensemble forecasting have improved the ability to evaluate flash flooding potential in urban areas. The Probabilistic Urban Flash Flood Information Nexis (PUFFIN) app integrates these components into a tool to evaluate the probability of an urban flash flood event and to identify specific infrastructure components at risk. PUFFIN uses a combination of deterministic and probabilistic precipitation forecasts to provide analyses over a range of spatial and temporal resolutions. A case study for the City of Roanoke, Virginia in the United States demonstrates how PUFFIN can be used to assess the risk of urban flooding.

      "abstract": "Recent technological advances in collecting data on emission sources, meteorological conditions and concentration of air pollutants in urban areas, offer invaluable opportunities for the better understanding of air quality problems. However, processing large sets of data to extract statistically valid evidence poses many challenges from both the conceptual and technical viewpoints. Air quality data acquisition, cleaning and authentication are necessary and crucial preliminary phases to support descriptive, predictive and prescriptive models and to ensure that aggregated and high-quality information is delivered to the central and local governments, decision makers and citizens. Automated software tools can facilitate drawing conclusions based on the information contained in the data, limiting subjective judgment and providing repeatability. However, the costly state-of-the-art software applications developed by major vendors are inaccessible to many cities and townships in the developing world. Moreover, their usage creates dependency on proprietary solutions, which can hinder the possibility of evolving the data processing and analysis protocols. We present an open-source web application for air quality data analysis and visualization, called aiRe, based on the R statistical framework and Shiny web package. aiRe has been developed in collaboration with the Colombian environmental authorities, and implements best practices validated by experts in air quality. We believe that the process of developing aiRe was extremely valuable with the ultimate purpose of supporting cities in air quality management, while strengthening local capabilities to improve urban air pollution. This open-access tool simplifies and makes air quality data analysis and visualization accessible, with the desirable effect of removing ownership costs, fostering appropriation by non-expert users and ultimately promoting informed decision-making for the general public and the local government authorities. We present the performance of this tool over a series of examples of open data collected by the air quality monitoring network of Bogotá, Colombia.",

Signatures are widely used for catchment characterisation, hydrologic model evaluation, and assessment of instream habitat, but standardisation across applications and advice on signature selection is lacking. The toolbox provides accessible, standardised signature calculations, with clear information on methodological decisions and recommended parameter values. The toolbox implements three categories of signatures: basic signatures that describe the five components of a natural streamflow regime, signatures from benchmark papers, and an extended set of process-based signatures. The toolbox is designed for ease of use, including documentation, workflow scripts and example data to demonstrate implementation procedures, and visualisation options. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the signature calculations by applying reproducible workflows to large streamflow datasets. The modular design of the toolbox allows for flexibility and easy future expansion. The toolbox is available from https://github.com/TOSSHtoolbox/TOSSH (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4313275).",

      "abstract": "Although water availability and water quality are equally important for an effective water resources management, to date, a combined representation of soil water balance components and water quality components in Python is not available. The new RoGeR toolbox contains models that can be used for the quantification of hydrological processes, fluxes and stores, but also solute transport processes based on StorAge selection. This study presents the code structure and functionalities of RoGeR developed as a scientific model toolbox following defined open-source software guidelines. RoGeR uses five different computational back ends covering just-in-time compilation, parallelism and graphical-processing units that might be used for optimizing computational performance. We show that graphical-processing unit computing have the greatest potential to improve computation time and energy usage especially for large modelling experiments. A simple modelling experiment highlights the capabilities of the new RoGeR model toolbox. We simulated the soil water balance, stable water isotope ( 18 O) transport and corresponding travel time distributions through the soil of a grassland plot for a three-year period. Further development of RoGeR as a scientific software is possible and also needed due to the current limitations for a variety of process components and easily possible due to the open software architecture.",

This paper presents the Synthetic Unit Hydrograph Tool (SUnHyT), which provides nine different UH models from the four main approaches used in UH applications. SUnHyT is an open-source application that can be used intuitively through a graphical user interface. We tested the model in a case study that highlights the need for alternative approaches of UH when the traditional approach does not perform well.

The objective of these products is to use a multi-index approach to fully capture the long- and short-term consequences of drought as an information service for the public. Since drought is a complex phenomenon relying on multiple variables such as rainfall evaporative demand, and antecedent soil moisture conditions, monitoring drought using a single index or indicator is not always appropriate.The Drought Monitor was developed using a normalized linear combination with weighting determined by PCA. It was evaluated against observed wheat yield as well as total pasture growth simulated by the AussieGRASS model. The results indicate that there was a significant positive correlation with both. The Drought Monitor was also well-received by survey respondents and has the potential to become a valuable drought monitoring tool for identifying drought impacts and related risks.",

      "journal": "Journal of Mountain Science",
      "citations": 5,
      "abstract": "Soil erosion and the subsequent sedimentation are serious environmental problems. Improper land management coupled with intense rainfall has complicated the problem in the Ethiopian highlands. Consequently, soil loss costs a profound amount of the national GDP and deters land productivity. Quantifying soil loss and prioritizing areas for conservation is imperative for proper planning and resource management. Therefore, this study aimed at estimating the mean annual soil loss rate of Gilgel Abay watershed which has critical implications on Lake Tana and Abbay River (Upper Blue Nile River), using RUSLE and morphometric analysis methods. Datasets including rainfall, soil, Digital Elevation Model and land use/land cover were used to generate important parameters required for the soil loss estimation. Data collected through field observation, consultation with experts and document analysis were used for validation purposes. The results of the study reveal that the watershed experienced an average soil loss rate of 39.8 t ha −1 yr −1 . Subsequently, nearly 25% (37,038 ha) of the watershed is threatened by moderate to very severe soil loss. Among the four sub watersheds, sub watershed 3 (S3) and sub watershed 4 (S4), which consist of about 65% (105,000 ha) of the total area of the study watershed, experienced an annual soil loss rate of over 30 t ha −1 yr −1 . The amount of soil loss that the study watershed has experienced is above the soil loss tolerance level of Ethiopia (2–18 t ha −1 yr −1 ) and the tropical region (10 t ha −1 yr −1 ). Similarly, the results of morphometric analysis showed that the studied watershed has S-shaped hypsometric curve, an indication for maturity stage of landscape development. The studied watershed is also characterized by a non-circular shaped drainage with rugged and dissected topography that contributes to high flash flood, peak discharge and incidence of soil loss. The result of both models signified that S3 and S4 are highly susceptible to soil erosion. Therefore, these two sub watersheds need priority for soil and water conservation (SWC) measures. Furthermore, the study demonstrated the importance of the integration of different models in the identification of soil erosion prone areas and prioritization for the proper implementation of SWC measures.",

      "journal": "Earth Surface Processes and Landforms",
      "citations": 1,
      "abstract": "Intense hydroelectric exploitation requires information on sediment flux to prevent the potential siltation of cascade reservoirs. As the main sediment source for the Yangtze River, the lower Jinsha River Basin (LJRB) lacks data on its sediment budget, which urges a thorough investigation to provide reliable estimates. This paper proposed a modelling framework to study soil erosion, sediment delivery, and sediment yield in this critical area with an emphasis on analyzing the underlying controls. Over the past 50 years, basin average erosion rates decreased from 26.5 to 23.7 t ha −1 a −1 , with erosion hotspots (>50 t ha −1 a −1 ) comprising only 21.1% of the basin area but contributing 69.5% of the gross erosion. Local steepness and sparse landcover conditions were found to be directly responsible for high erosions, rather than precipitation or soils. With a dimensionality reduction strategy to remove redundant factors, the optimal variables for modelling sediment delivery ratio ( SDR ) were identified as Specific Catchment Area, Maximum Elevation, and Drainage Area. These three variables all had a positive correlation with SDR , and the established model can explain 86% of the SDR variation. Further modelling revealed regionalised SDR s ranging from 0.07 to 0.38 for 39 subbasins, about 30% of which were no less than 0.35. Regionalised specific sediment yield ( SSY ) ranged from 1.3 to 16.9 t ha −1 a −1 with 38% of the high SSY s (above 8 t ha −1 a −1 ) concentrating in the reservoir area from Wudongde to Xiluodu that poses siltation risks. This study addressed the scarcity of sediment budget knowledge in the LJRB, and the coupled model of erosion and sediment delivery has been validated with satisfactory predictions. Therefore, the modelling framework proposed may be adopted to diverse river basins for its low parameter requirements and solid modelling performance.",

      "abstract": "Soil moisture is an important variable in hydrological studies, but has been little used for model evaluation due to its high sensitivity to local conditions. We explore the possibility to derive hydrological signatures from soil moisture data that could overcome this limitation and be helpful for model evaluation. A set of eight hydrological signatures was built, encompassing long‐term to short‐term time scales. These signatures were tested according to robustness, representativeness and discriminatory power, using in situ data sets from New Zealand, including national network and experimental watershed data. Field capacity, type of soil moisture distribution, and starting dates of seasonal transitions typically meet the criteria, subject to uniform sensor depths and homogeneous land uses. Durations of seasonal transitions and event‐based signatures showed higher variability and lower discriminatory power. In general, long‐term signatures are more robust, more representative of large areas, and have a high discriminatory power, thus showing a good potential for use in diagnostic evaluation of regional models.",

      "abstract": "Accurate knowledge of the spatiotemporal behavior of soil moisture (SM) can greatly improve hydrological forecasting capability. While ground-based SM measurements exhibit greater accuracy, they tend to be sparse in space and available for limited periods. To overcome this, a viable alternative is space-borne microwave remote sensing because of the near real-time observational capability at the global scale. However, its direct applications have been limited because of the uncertainty associated and the coarse spatial resolution the products are available at. Considering its usefulness and limitations, this paper is intended to provide an extensive review of satellite-derived SM and its applications for assessing flood risk in sparsely gauged or ungauged catchments worldwide. Therefore, we aim to identify and discuss research gaps, and finally propose future research directions for improvement and hydrological applications of these SM products. The paper starts with a brief introduction to satellite-derived SM products and consists of three interdependent focal areas: evaluation, improvement, and application of the satellite SM for flood risk alleviation.",

      "journal": "Science of the Total Environment",
      "citations": 46,
      "abstract": "Hydroclimatic time series analysis focuses on a few feature types (e.g., autocorrelations, trends, extremes), which describe a small portion of the entire information content of the observations. Aiming to exploit a larger part of the available information and, thus, to deliver more reliable results (e.g., in hydroclimatic time series clustering contexts), here we approach hydroclimatic time series analysis differently, i.e., by performing massive feature extraction. In this respect, we develop a big data framework for hydroclimatic variable behaviour characterization. This framework relies on approximately 60 diverse features and is completely automatic (in the sense that it does not depend on the hydroclimatic process at hand). We apply the new framework to characterize mean monthly temperature, total monthly precipitation and mean monthly river flow. The applications are conducted at the global scale by exploiting 40-year-long time series originating from over 13 000 stations. We extract interpretable knowledge on seasonality, trends, autocorrelation, long-range dependence and entropy, and on feature types that are met less frequently. We further compare the examined hydroclimatic variable types in terms of this knowledge and, identify patterns related to the spatial variability of the features. For this latter purpose, we also propose and exploit a hydroclimatic time series clustering methodology. This new methodology is based on Breiman's random forests. The descriptive and exploratory insights gained by the global-scale applications prove the usefulness of the adopted feature compilation in hydroclimatic contexts. Moreover, the spatially coherent patterns characterizing the clusters delivered by the new methodology build confidence in its future exploitation. Given this spatial coherence and the scale-independent nature of the delivered feature values (which makes them particularly useful in forecasting and simulation contexts), we believe that this methodology could also be beneficial within regionalization frameworks, in which knowledge on hydrological similarity is exploited in technical and operative terms.",

      "abstract": "The time of concentration is one of the most widely used parameters in hydrological design, as well as one of the most uncertain hydrological concepts. This uncertainty derives from the simultaneous use of different definitions for this parameter and the subsequent development of a plethora of different estimation methods. Commonly used methods rely on parameter estimation to describe various catchment characteristics or hydrometeorological conditions, as well as rainfall–runoff events separation; both of these processes are highly uncertain. This study uses a methodology initially developed for timeseries analysis in economics and adapted for use in hydrology. It is a newly proposed framework which estimates the average time of concentration directly from rainfall and streamflow timeseries, bypassing the need for event selection and any parameter estimation. This approach is applied to 549 catchments across the UK and, by taking advantage of these more reliable estimations of the time of concentration, this research tries to identify the most important catchment characteristics in describing time of concentration. To this end, it uses machine learning approaches to find and interpret the connection between the estimated time of concentration and the catchment attributes derived from the CAMELS-GB database. It then attempts to develop a predictive framework which could estimate the catchment response time using these most influential characteristics. This framework could be employed in ungauged catchments with limited rainfall and streamflow records, making use of information learnt from catchments with a similar hydrological regime.",

      "citations": 32,
      "abstract": "Drought and flood are investigated in the Pearl River basin (PRB) using long-term terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) data from the mascon (mass concentration) solutions based on Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite measurements (2002–19) and reanalysis data (1980–2019). The GRACE mascon solutions capture two major drought periods (2003–06 and 2009–12) with similar onsets and endings over the last two decades, but show considerable differences in quantifying total drought severity. The reanalysis data significantly overestimate drought duration and severity during 1980–2000 owing to overestimated negative TWSA forced by underestimated precipitation. The GRACE mascon solutions identify four major flood events in August 2002, June 2008, and July in 2006 and 2019. The flood potential is influenced by the precipitation in both the current and antecedent months. The flood potential index of the most recent flood in 2008 showed a similar spatial pattern compared to precipitation at monthly and subbasin scales. The precipitation and TWSA in the PRB are mainly influenced by El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). TWSA exhibits a lag of 1–3 months responding to ENSO during 1980–2019. This study emphasizes the significance of removing water storage changes in new large reservoirs before long-term drought and flood characterization. The inclusion of reservoir water storage would expand (shrink) the drought duration and overestimate (underestimate) drought severity for the period before (after) reservoir impoundment and overestimate flood potential for the period after reservoir impoundment. This study highlights the intensifying drought conditions in the PRB over the last four decades under the circumstances of more frequent human activities (reservoir construction and regulation) and the complex changing climate system.",

      "citations": 60,
      "abstract": "Estimating precipitation at high spatial-temporal resolution is vital in manifold hydrological, meteorological and water management applications, especially over areas with un-gauged networks and regions where water resources are on the wane. This study aims to evaluate five downscaling methods to determine the accuracy and efficiency of which on generating high-resolution precipitation data at annual and monthly scales. To establish precipitation-Land surface characteristics relationship, environmental factors, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM), were considered as proxies in the spatial downscaling procedure. The downscaling algorithms, namely support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), geographically weighted regression (GWR), multiple linear regression (MLR) and exponential regression (ER), were implemented to downscale the version 7 of TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) precipitation (3B43 V7 product) over Lake Urmia Basin (LUB) from 0.25° to 1 km spatial resolution. The downscaled precipitation data was validated against observations from meteorological stations. Monthly fractions derived from TRMM 3B43 were used to disaggregate 1 km annual precipitation to 1 km monthly precipitation. Furthermore, the best method was selected for calibration based on Geographical Difference Analysis (GDA) to assess the effectiveness of the calibration as a viable option. The results indicate that SVM not only outperforms the other methods, but also has good agreements with in-situ measurements compared to the original TRMM. The results confirm that inclusion of LST and geographic information along with NDVI can improve the downscaling performance. Downscaling and GDA calibration significantly improve the accuracy of TRMM 3B43 product at both spatial and temporal resolution and should be considered as an essential step in calibration of TRMM precipitation. Calibration at monthly scale yields slightly better results than calibration at annual scale and then disaggregating into monthly maps in terms of accuracy assessment.",

      "abstract": "Ensemble-tree machine learning (ML) regression models can be prone to systematic bias: small values are overestimated and large values are underestimated. Additional bias can be introduced if the dependent variable is a transform of the original data. Six methods were evaluated for their ability to correct systematic and introduced bias. Method performance was evaluated using four case studies of groundwater quality: the units of the dependent variable were pH in two and log-concentration in the others. When performance metrics (bias and RMSE for both points and the CDF) were computed using the same units as those in the ML model, empirical distribution matching (EDM) provided the best results. When the metrics were computed using retransformed concentration, EDM and a method incorporating Duan's smearing estimate were both effective. A method based on the Z-score transform approximates EDM if the correlation coefficient between rank-ordered ML estimates and rank-ordered observations approaches one.",

      "citations": 25,
      "abstract": "Downscaling of local daily precipitation from large-scale climatic variables is required for assessing the impact of climate change on hydrology and water resources. This study proposes wavelet transform (WT)-based Feed-Forward Neural Network (FF-NN) and Nonlinear Auto Regressive with exogenous inputs Network (NARX-NN) models for downscaling daily precipitation. The models are applied to a large river basin, the Krishna River basin, in the Indian subcontinent. Several climatic variables, including geo-potential heights, wind direction, vorticity, humidity, air temperature, mean sea level pressure, meridional velocity at surface, and 500hpa and 850hpa levels, are considered based on their statistical correlations. The results are evaluated using different performance measures and the ability of the models to capture the extreme events at five selected grid points (in different locations) having varying climatic characteristics is assessed. The performance of the proposed wavelet-based models is also compared with that of four different traditional and recent downscaling methods: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM), Genetic Programming (GP), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The results reveal that the wavelet-based neural network models (WT-FF-NN and WT-NARX-NN) are robust compared to the other methods in terms of their ability to capture the regional precipitation patterns and the extreme events. The improvement in the wavelet-based models can be attributed to their ability to unravel the hidden relationship between the predictors and precipitation. It is also observed that there is considerable increase in the correlation between precipitation and the decomposed climatic variables. All these results suggest that wavelets aid in unravelling the relationship between local precipitation and large-scale climatic variables and improving the overall performance of the downscaling models.",

      "abstract": "Continuous streamflow prediction is crucial in many applications of water resources planning and management. However, streamflow prediction is challenging, particularly in data-scarce regions. This paper demonstrates an approach to regionalize the flow duration curve for predicting daily streamflow in the data-scare region of the central Himalayas. We developed a regression-based model to estimate streamflow at various segments of a flow duration curve by incorporating basin characteristics and climate variables. This study analyzes the sensitivities of proximity and characteristics between the donor (gauged) and receptor (ungauged) basins for time-series streamflow prediction. Our results show that regionalization techniques perform better in low to medium flows over high flows. Our findings are significant in the central Himalayan regional context to inform operational and management decisions in water sector projects like hydropower plants, which generally rely on low-to-medium streamflow information. Although the quantitative results are region-specific, the approach and insights are generalizable to the Himalayan region.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Research",
      "citations": 23,
      "abstract": "Periodic fluctuations in natural streamflow are a major driver of river ecosystem dynamics and water resource management. However, most U.S. rivers are impacted both by long‐term hydroclimatic trends and dams that alter flow variability. Despite these impacts, it remains largely unexplored how dams affect the dominant frequencies of natural streamflow over a highly regulated river network. We investigated the entire Colorado River Basin (CRB) to understand how the annual (10–14 months) and multi‐annual (24–60 months) frequencies in natural flow regimes have been progressively altered by dams. Given the significant alteration over the CRB, we captured changes in streamflow frequencies between naturalized and observed monthly flows via wavelet analysis. Based on the similarity of changes in streamflow frequencies (annual and multi‐annual) over the last 30 years, sections of the riverine network were classified into four groups. The annual frequency was relatively well preserved downstream of Hoover Dam, while showing a systematic trend of alteration downstream of Glen Canyon Dam until Hoover Dam. Meanwhile, the multi‐annual frequency component was highly altered for the entire Lower Colorado main stem (i.e., downstream of Glen Canyon). We also identified dams with significant impacts on streamflow frequency by comparing wavelet coherence estimates. This study advances the notion that dams fundamentally alter river flow regimes across multiple frequencies and with varying amplitudes over time and space, with alteration propagating – or being dampened – by both hydroclimatic fluctuations and water resource management.",

      "abstract": "Anthropogenic climate change has impacted almost all phases of the global water cycle. Growing consensus asserts that extreme precipitation events will only rise in the years to come. However, an increase in extreme precipitation events does not necessarily correspond to higher flood risk. Much onus lies on the antecedent conditions before the storm events. Despite the importance of Soil Moisture (SM) – Precipitation (P) dependence in runoff generation, relatively few studies have unraveled the SM – P dependence. Previous studies were constrained by the direct trivial relationship existing between SM and P, and hence there is a need to understand direction and dynamical interdependency. We employed Event Coincidence Analysis (ECA) to identify and quantify the preconditioning of P extremes by soil moisture (SM) anomalies. High precursor coincidence rate (greater than45%) was obtained for traditional flash flood-prone areas over India - Ganga river basin, West-flowing rivers of Kutch and Saurashtra including Luni, inland drainage of Rajasthan and Narmada river basin, indicating the robustness of the approach. The trigger coincidence rate reveals strong SM-P coupling over central India. Our results indicate the applicability of ECA in characterizing the spatiotemporal patterns of SM-P dependence over India.",

      "citations": 13,
      "abstract": "A continent-wide classification study of Australian catchments was undertaken to group drainage basins with comparable flow characteristics based on forty metrics from the themes of climate, topography, surface condition and hydrogeology. A principal component analysis reduced the multi-collinear indices to nine principal components (PCs). A fuzzy c-means cluster analysis on the PCs resulted in the delineation of eight subcatchment clusters with similar physiography, and 82.5% of subcatchments displaying a membership coefficient greater than 0.7. Subcatchments with poor cluster membership levels may be significant in highlighting complexity in the interaction between climatic controls and local geomorphological and land use variability. The clusters are distinguished by different attributes in several key subcatchment variables and each group is described in terms of its flow and flood profile. These interpretations are supported by separately derived streamflow signatures from gauged catchments. Cluster and PC distribution mapping revealed distinct spatial and drainage relationships between the subcatchments relevant to the assessment of flood behaviour. The spatial pattern of the river basin regionalisation via physical catchment similarity closely resembles the modified Köppen climate classification, with differences highlighting the importance of non-climate characteristics on streamflow behaviour in Australia. The catchment classification is an Australia-wide regionalisation scheme, incorporating datasets with disparate spatial distribution and ungauged subcatchments. This study therefore provides the framework for more detailed streamflow analysis by applying consistent methods across all catchments in Australia, and has implications for flood risk prediction, mitigation and planning.",

The present study focuses on the river basins located within the HKH region in Pakistan. The modified Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT+) was used to split the research region into 13 sub-basins. The Mann–Kendall, Sen's slope, innovative polygon trend analysis (IPTA), and innovative trend analysis (ITA) methods were used for the monthly precipitation time series. The Shyok sub-basin (central Karakoram) experienced rising trends for all seasons, while the southwestern Karakoram (Hunza) showed a rising trend only for the winter. The Hindukush Mountain Range feeds five sub-basins (Gilgit, Chitral, Swat, Kabul, and Kurram). The Gilgit and Kurram sub-basins observed an upward trend for all seasons. A falling trend in spring and transition from spring (falling) to summer (rising) was observed for the Swat and Kabul sub-basins. The Chitral sub-basin received rising precipitation in spring, summer, and autumn, whereas no trend was observed during winter. In the southern Himalayas (Kanshi and Jhelum), no trend was observed in winter and autumn and a falling trend in spring and summer. The Kunhar sub-basin (southern Himalaya) showed rising trends in winter, spring, and autumn. In contrast, the Soan sub-basin (eastern Himalaya) has no trend in spring, and other seasons show rising trends. The sub-basin Upper Indus experienced a rising trend for autumn, winter, and summer, while a downward trend was observed in spring. The IPTA and ITA approaches are much more sensitive than the Mann–Kendall method in detecting trends. Although the innovative methods are mostly compatible with each other (90%), the IPTA presents additional information about trend transitions between successive parts of the time series. The results presented in this study are an advancement in the investigations made so far in this region and will help to understand the climate and hydrology of this region.",

      "abstract": "Climate change coupled with increased anthropogenic activities intensifies the potency and frequency of extreme weather events. While multihazard assessments of these extreme weather events enhance the estimation of hazard susceptibility, it must be coupled with identifying institutional barriers of managing the land-river interface. Thus, this study has carried out a multihazard susceptibility assessment based on landslide and flood susceptibility in the Sutlej-Beas River basin and prepared flood and landslide susceptibility maps using eleven causative parameters through a bivariate statistical frequency ratio (FR) model. This statistical evaluation of hazard susceptibility from multiple factors is supplemented by identifying the key barriers of managing the land-river interface, producing a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges of mitigating extreme weather-related hazards in a river basin. Nearly 51% of the study area was identified as susceptible to landslide while 43% was under flood and 48% area was observed under multihazard susceptibility. Landslides, floods, and multihazard followed a similar pattern of spatial distribution where elevation, population, drainage density, stream power index (SPI), and rainfall were identified as the contributing parameters. Changing attitudes of people toward rivers, lack of coordination among different stakeholders, and deficit funds were identified as prominent barriers in the case of land-river management. Susceptibility maps generated in this study will help in identifying the areas under hazard susceptibility while the identified institutional barriers may guide towards contextual sustainable planning of the basin and attainment of sustainable development goals.",

      "citations": 4,
      "abstract": "Climate extremes have grown increasingly severe and frequent, posing significant threats to both economies and ecosystems. Prior research largely focused on individual hazard occurrences, often overlooking the compounded effects of multiple extreme events. With the escalating anthropogenic activities and increasing temperatures in Asia, there is an imperative need to investigate the occurrence of compound dry hazards (CDHs). This study aims to conduct a comprehensive assessment of CDHs in Asia, with a specific focus on examining the co-occurrence of heatwaves, droughts, fire dangers, and extreme winds over a 42-year period from 1980 to 2021. To be specific, our research focuses on evaluating interannual variability, identifying geographical hotspots, analyzing temporal shifts in cascading compound events, and exploring the dependence structure within CDHs. Our results indicate a significant increase in the spatial extent of CDHs in recent decades, with varying patterns in annual average frequencies across Asian regions. Particularly significant is the concentration of CDH hotspots within developing countries situated in East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Moreover, our analysis highlights substantial increases in both the frequency and duration of cascading events (CEs), particularly in densely populated areas across North, Central, East, and West Asia. Conversely, South Asia experiences conspicuous declines in CEs. Lastly, our investigation into the dependence structure among CDHs illustrates varying degrees of interdependence among dry hazards and diverse spatial relationships across different Asian regions. We believe that these findings are highly valuable for enhancing natural risk management, improving climate model accuracy, and fortifying strategies to address the evolving risks associated with compound climate extremes under climate change.",

      "journal": "Hydrology and Earth System Sciences",
      "citations": 639,
      "abstract": "To assess global water availability and use at a subannual timescale, an integrated global water resources model was developed consisting of six modules: land surface hydrology, river routing, crop growth, reservoir operation, environmental flow requirement estimation, and anthropogenic water withdrawal. The model simulates both natural and anthropogenic water flow globally (excluding Antarctica) on a daily basis at a spatial resolution of 1°×1° (longitude and latitude). This first part of the two-feature report describes the six modules and the input meteorological forcing. The input meteorological forcing was provided by the second Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP2), an international land surface modeling project. Several reported shortcomings of the forcing component were improved. The land surface hydrology module was developed based on a bucket type model that simulates energy and water balance on land surfaces. The crop growth module is a relatively simple model based on concepts of heat unit theory, potential biomass, and a harvest index. In the reservoir operation module, 452 major reservoirs with >1 km 3 each of storage capacity store and release water according to their own rules of operation. Operating rules were determined for each reservoir by an algorithm that used currently available global data such as reservoir storage capacity, intended purposes, simulated inflow, and water demand in the lower reaches. The environmental flow requirement module was newly developed based on case studies from around the world. Simulated runoff was compared and validated with observation-based global runoff data sets and observed streamflow records at 32 major river gauging stations around the world. Mean annual runoff agreed well with earlier studies at global and continental scales, and in individual basins, the mean bias was less than ±20% in 14 of the 32 river basins and less than ±50% in 24 basins. The error in the peak was less than ±1 mo in 19 of the 27 basins and less than ±2 mo in 25 basins. The performance was similar to the best available precedent studies with closure of energy and water. The input meteorological forcing component and the integrated model provide a framework with which to assess global water resources, with the potential application to investigate the subannual variability in water resources.",

      "citations": 12,
      "abstract": "A grid-based distributed hydrological model, PDTank model, is used to simulate hydrological processes in the upper Tone River catchment. The Tone River catchment often suffers from heavy rainfall events during the typhoon seasons. The reservoirs located in the catchment play an important role in flood regulation. Through the coupling of the PDTank model and a reservoir module that combines the storage function and operation function, the PDTank model is used for flood forecasting in this study. By comparing the hydrographs simulated using gauging and radar rainfall data, it is found that the spatial variability of rainfall is an important factor for flood simulation and the accuracy of the hydrographs simulated using radar rainfall data is slightly improved. The simulation of the typhoon flood event numbered No. 9 shows that the reservoirs in the catchment attenuate the peak flood discharge by 423·3 m3/s and validates the potential applicability of the distributed hydrological model on the assessment of function of reservoirs for flood control during typhoon seasons.",

      "abstract": "Hydrological simulation in regions with a large number of water storages is difficult due to inaccurate water storage data. To address this issue, this paper presents an improved version of SWAT2005 (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, version 2005) using Landsat, a satellite-based dataset, an empirical storage classification method and some empirical relationships to estimate water storage and release from the various sizes of flow detention and regulation facilities. The SWAT2005 is enhanced by three features: (1) a realistic representation of the relationships between the surface area and volume of each type of water storages, ranging from small-sized flow detention ponds to medium- and large-sized reservoirs with the various flow regulation functions; (2) water balance and transport through a network combining both sequential and parallel streams and storage links; and (3) calibrations for both physical and human interference parameters. Through a real-world watershed case study, it is found that the improved SWAT2005 more accurately models small- and medium-sized storages than the original model in reproducing streamflows in the watershed. The improved SWAT2005 can be an effective tool to assess the impact of water storage on hydrologic processes, which has not been well addressed in the current modelling exercises.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Research",
      "citations": 151,
      "abstract": "A catastrophic flood event which caused massive economic losses occurred in Thailand, in 2011. Several studies have already been conducted to analyze the Thai floods, but none of them have assessed the impacts of reservoir operation on flood inundation. This study addresses this gap by combining physically based hydrological models to explicitly simulate the impacts of reservoir operation on flooding in the Chao Phraya River Basin, Thailand. H08, an integrated water resources model with a reservoir operation module, was combined with CaMa‐Flood, a river routing model with representation of flood dynamics. The combined H08‐CaMa model was applied to simulate and assess the historical and alternative reservoir operation rules in the two largest reservoirs in the basin. The combined H08‐CaMa model effectively simulated the 2011 flood: regulated flows at a major gauging station have high daily NSE‐coefficient of 92% as compared with observed discharge; spatiotemporal extent of simulated flood inundation match well with those of satellite observations. Simulation results show that through the operation of reservoirs in 2011, flood volume was reduced by 8.6 billion m 3 and both depth and area of flooding were reduced by 40% on the average. Nonetheless, simple modifications in reservoir operation proved to further reduce the flood volume by 2.4 million m 3 and the depth and area of flooding by 20% on the average. By modeling reservoir operation with a hydrodynamic model, a more realistic simulation of the 2011 Thai flood was made possible, and the potential of reducing flood inundation through improved reservoir management was quantified.",

      "abstract": "Human activities are known to increase interference with runoff. Conversely, human activities related to utilizing and managing water resources are primarily determined by annual runoff processes dominated by precipitation distribution. With this view, the soil and water assessment tool was used to quantify human-induced annual runoff changes at different periods and under different patterns of precipitation in seven catchments in Northeast China. The conclusions are as follows. First, although human activities have distinct regional characteristics, an increase in reduced runoff is found for the catchments under investigation; human-induced runoff changes are more significant in the catchment where water resources are limited. Second, the interannual runoff distribution is significantly disturbed in the catchment with large reservoirs. Third, human-induced runoff changes are similar under all patterns of precipitation in the catchment where annual precipitation is less than 500 mm and intense human activities play a dominant role in runoff. Fourth, in general catchments, runoff changes more significantly during relatively drier years or years with uneven precipitation distribution. Finally, human-induced runoff change is related to both annual precipitation characteristics and operations of the reservoirs for catchments in which reservoirs played a significant role.",

      "abstract": "Floodplains are regions of great interest for environmental assessment as they constitute important ecological reserves and contribute efficiently to natural flood attenuation. However, the implementation of a model describing the basic hydrological behaviour of floodplains is not an easy task due to the complexity of the processes included. Although several attempts have been made to simulate floodplain effects in global rainfall-runoff models, no satisfactory routines have been developed yet. In this study, an adapted version of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (2009) reservoir model is proposed and applied to the Zambezi Basin at daily time step with the intention of adequately modelling floodplain behaviour. The model separates the outflow of the reservoir simulating the floodplain into main channel flow and flow over the floodplain area. The improved solution was compared with the original model regarding its potential to simulate observed discharges in terms of volume ratio, the Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient and hydrograph plots. These evaluation criteria attest, for both calibration and validation periods, that the modified model is superior to the original one for simulating the discharge downstream of large floodplains. A sensitivity analysis is carried out at two geographical levels: at the outlet of a floodplain and at the outlet of the entire basin. The results show that upper flow parameters are more sensitive than base flow parameters.",

      "abstract": "Regarding emerging large-scale reservoir operation models, reports of reservoir operation feedback for hydrologic modeling are rare, and little attention has been paid to flood control. An operation scheme considering multilevel flood control (MLFC) was first proposed in this study, but more reservoir information was needed. Thus, an alternative scheme was proposed that consisted of a modified version of the reservoir operation scheme in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool Model (MSWAT scheme). These schemes were coupled to a land surface and hydrologic model system with feedback, i.e., a system in which reservoir operation can affect the subsequent simulation, and were investigated in the Huai River Basin. The results show reservoir storage and peak flow were generally overestimated by the original SWAT reservoir scheme (SWAT scheme). Compared with the SWAT scheme, the MSWAT scheme successfully reduced the simulated storage and peak flow at the reservoir stations. For the downstream stations, the streamflow simulations were improved at a significance level of 5%. The performances of the MSWAT and MLFC schemes at the reservoir stations were nearly equivalent. Importantly, reservoir operation feedback to hydrologic modeling was necessary because the reservoir operation effects could not be transferred downstream without it. The streamflow simulation of a reservoir station located on a flat plain was less sensitive to feedback than that of a mountain reservoir station.",

      "abstract": "During the past several decades, numerous reservoirs have been built across the world for a variety of purposes such as flood control, irrigation, municipal/industrial water supplies, and hydropower generation. Consequently, the timing and magnitude of natural streamflow have been altered significantly by reservoir operations. In addition, the hydrological cycle is also modified by land-use/land-cover change and by climate change. To understand the fine-scale feedback between hydrological processes and water management decisions, a distributed hydrological model embedded with a reservoir component is desired. In this study, a multi-purpose reservoir module with predefined complex operational rules was integrated into the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM). Conditional operating rules, which are designed to reduce flood risk and enhance water supply reliability, were adopted in this module. The performance of the integrated model was tested over the upper Brazos River Basin in Texas, where two U.S. Army Corps of Engineers managed reservoirs, Lake Whitney and Aquilla Lake, are located. The integrated model was calibrated and validated using observed reservoir inflow, outflow, and storage data. The error statistics were summarized for both reservoirs on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Using the weekly reservoir storage for Lake Whitney as an example, the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) was 0.85 and the Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) was 0.75. These results suggest that this reservoir module holds promise for use in sub-monthly hydrological simulations. With the new reservoir component, the DHSVM provides a platform to support adaptive water resources management under the impacts of evolving anthropogenic activities and substantial environmental changes.",

      "abstract": "Flooding is the most prevalent and costly natural disaster in the world and building reservoirs is one of the major structural measures for flood control and management. In this paper, a framework was proposed to evaluate functions of reservoirs′ locations and magnitudes on daily peak flow attenuation for a large basin of China, namely Ganjiang River Basin. In this study, the Xinanjiang model was adopted to simulate inflows of the reservoirs and flood hydrographs of all sub-catchments of the basin, and simple reservoir operation rules were established for calculating outflows of the reservoirs. Four reservoirs scenarios were established to analyze reservoirs′ locations on daily peak flow attenuation. The results showed that: 1) reservoirs attenuated the peak discharges for all simulated floods, when the flood storage capacities increase as new reservoirs were built, the peak discharge attenuation by reservoirs showed an increasing tendency both in absolute and relative measures; 2) reservoirs attenuated more peak discharge relatively for small floods than for large ones; 3) reservoirs reduced the peak discharge more efficiently for the floods with single peak or multi peaks with main peak occurred first; and 4) effect of upstream reservoirs on peak attenuation decreased from upper reaches to lower reaches; upstream and midstream reservoirs played important roles in decreasing peak discharge both at middle and lower reaches, and downstream reservoirs had less effect on large peak discharge attenuation at outlet of the basin. The proposed framework of evaluating functions of multiple reservoirs′ storage capacities and locations on peak attenuation is valuable for flood control planning and management at basin scale.",

      "citations": 138,
      "abstract": "Lakes and reservoirs affect the timing and magnitude of streamflow, and are therefore essential hydrological model components, especially in the context of global flood forecasting. However, the parameterization of lake and reservoir routines on a global scale is subject to considerable uncertainty due to lack of information on lake hydrographic characteristics and reservoir operating rules. In this study we estimated the effect of lakes and reservoirs on global daily streamflow simulations of a spatially-distributed LISFLOOD hydrological model. We applied state-of-the-art global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses for selected catchments to examine the effect of uncertain lake and reservoir parameterization on model performance. Streamflow observations from 390 catchments around the globe and multiple performance measures were used to assess model performance. Results indicate a considerable geographical variability in the lake and reservoir effects on the streamflow simulation. Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) metrics improved for 65% and 38% of catchments respectively, with median skill score values of 0.16 and 0.2 while scores deteriorated for 28% and 52% of the catchments, with median values −0.09 and −0.16, respectively. The effect of reservoirs on extreme high flows was substantial and widespread in the global domain, while the effect of lakes was spatially limited to a few catchments. As indicated by global sensitivity analysis, parameter uncertainty substantially affected uncertainty of model performance. Reservoir parameters often contributed to this uncertainty, although the effect varied widely among catchments. The effect of reservoir parameters on model performance diminished with distance downstream of reservoirs in favor of other parameters, notably groundwater-related parameters and channel Manning’s roughness coefficient. This study underscores the importance of accounting for lakes and, especially, reservoirs and using appropriate parameterization in large-scale hydrological simulations.",

      "abstract": "Manmade reservoirs are important components of the terrestrial water balance. Thus, considering the hydro-climatic effects of reservoirs is important in water cycle studies at a river basin to global scales; yet, reservoirs are represented poorly in large-scale hydrological and climate models. Here we present a high-resolution (5 km) continental-scale reservoir storage dynamics and release scheme by enhancing existing schemes and adding critical novel parameterizations to improve reservoir storage and release simulations. The new scheme simulates river-floodplain-reservoir storages in an integrated manner considering their spatial and temporal variations. A new calibration scheme is also incorporated to better simulate reservoir dynamics considering cascade-reservoir effects. Further, since no reservoir bathymetry data are available over large domains, we use a state-of-the-art digital elevation model and reservoir extent data to derive reservoir bed elevation. The new scheme is integrated within the river-floodplain routing scheme of a continental hydrological model LEAF-Hydro-Flood. Results from the simulation of ~1,900 reservoirs within the contiguous United States suggest that the model well captures the observed reservoir storage-release dynamics. Comparison of our results with those from the existing schemes suggest a significant improvement; importantly, the new scheme reduces the excessive and frequent reservoir overfilling and underfilling. Comparison of results with satellite-based surface water data shows that the model accurately reproduces the large-scale patterns of reservoir-floodplain inundation extents. It is expected that the results of this study will inform the incorporation of reservoirs in hyper-resolution models to improve simulations of terrestrial water storage and flow and examine reservoir-atmosphere interactions over large domains.",

      "journal": "Hydrology and Earth System Sciences",
      "citations": 130,
      "abstract": "Reservoirs significantly affect flow regimes in watershed systems by changing the magnitude and timing of streamflows. Failure to represent these effects limits the performance of hydrological and land-surface models (H-LSMs) in the many highly regulated basins across the globe and limits the applicability of such models to investigate the futures of watershed systems through scenario analysis (e.g., scenarios of climate, land use, or reservoir regulation changes). An adequate representation of reservoirs and their operation in an H-LSM is therefore essential for a realistic representation of the downstream flow regime. In this paper, we present a general parametric reservoir operation model based on piecewise-linear relationships between reservoir storage, inflow, and release to approximate actual reservoir operations. For the identification of the model parameters, we propose two strategies: (a) a “generalized” parameterization that requires a relatively limited amount of data and (b) direct calibration via multi-objective optimization when more data on historical storage and release are available. We use data from 37 reservoir case studies located in several regions across the globe for developing and testing the model. We further build this reservoir operation model into the MESH (Modélisation Environmentale-Surface et Hydrologie) modeling system, which is a large-scale H-LSM. Our results across the case studies show that the proposed reservoir model with both parameter-identification strategies leads to improved simulation accuracy compared with the other widely used approaches for reservoir operation simulation. We further show the significance of enabling MESH with this reservoir model and discuss the interdependent effects of the simulation accuracy of natural processes and that of reservoir operations on the overall model performance. The reservoir operation model is generic and can be integrated into any H-LSM.",

      "citations": 25,
      "abstract": "Damming is one of the major methods that human being secure reliable freshwater. It can change flow magnitude and regime along a river, particularly for Transboundary Rivers shared by multiple jurisdictions. This study develops a coupled framework to assess both the current and future cumulative impacts of damming on downstream water availability for data-sparse regions like the Tibetan Plateau. The framework is applied to the Brahmaputra River Basin (BRB), where dam developments on the Tibetan Plateau are highly concerned. The results show that, despite being part of the ‘Asian water tower’, the Yarlung Tsangpo River (YTR) contributes just 15-16% to Brahmaputra streamflow, for 48% of its contributing area. We found that the maximum impact due to five recently constructed dams in YTR suggests about 8-11% reduction of mean annual streamflow at outlet of Brahmaputra River. The impacts of damming would be largely offset by runoff increases under the climate scenarios projected by 28 CMIP5 model outputs from RCP4.5 median-level emission scenarios and 29 CMIP5 model outputs from RCP8.5 high-level emission scenarios for the period of 2049 to 2075, compared to the historical period of 1979 to 2005. Our results suggest that it is necessary to use our framework or a similar one to comprehensively evaluate the maximum possible damming impact across the Transboundary Rivers.",

The operation of such a reservoir network can serve as a significant source of variability in the local hydrological regime and should be included in research to better understand the interaction between multiple hydrological processes and watershed management. In this study, a reservoir network module that included reservoirs of multiple sizes was developed and fully integrated into the coupled land surface and distributed hydrologic model system (CLHMS), for a detailed description of the hydrological impact of a reservoir network. A generalized release scheme was employed to determine the outflow of both large and small reservoirs. The integrated model was then evaluated against observations and reanalysis data, which indicate that the model can reasonably reconstruct the reservoir operation, streamflow, and other hydrological variables. Results quantitatively demonstrate that a reservoir network can result in an increased streamflow in dry seasons, a decreased streamflow in wet seasons, a generally larger groundwater discharge, higher groundwater level, a slightly damper soil condition, and a larger amount of evapotranspiration at the basin level. With the integrated model, it is feasible to achieve more sustainable watershed planning and management.",

      "citations": 45,
      "abstract": "Large-scale hydrologic–hydrodynamic models are powerful tools for integrated water resources evaluation at the basin scale, especially in the context of flood hazard assessment. However, recent model developments have paid little attention to simulate reservoirs’ hydrodynamics within river networks. This study presents an adaptation of the MGB model to simulate reservoirs as an internal boundary condition, enabling the explicit simulation of hydrodynamic processes along reservoirs and their interaction with upstream and downstream floodplains in large basins. A case study is carried out in the Itajaí-Açu River Basin in Brazil, which has periodic flood-related disasters and three flood control dams. The model was calibrated for the 1950–2016 period forced with daily observed precipitation. The adjustment was satisfactory, with Nash–Sutcliffe metrics between 0.54 and 0.84 for the 11 gauges analyzed and with flood frequency curves also well represented. Simulation scenarios with and without floodplains and reservoirs were performed to evaluate the relative role of these factors on flood control basin-wide through evaluation of simulated discharges, water levels and flood extent. Itajaí do Oeste tributary and Itajaí-Açu mainstem present major floodplain attenuation, while in Itajaí do Sul and Itajaí do Norte tributaries the main flood control occurs due to reservoir attenuation. Downstream from the dams, results indicated that the reservoirs reach their maximum discharge reduction capacity for 5- to 10-year floods, decreasing it for larger floods. The developed model may be very useful for operational uses as flood forecasting and coordinated reservoir operation studies, as well as to enhance the comprehension of flood dynamics at basin scale.",

      "abstract": "The Mekong River Basin, one of the largest river basins in Asia, is facing a great challenge to meet escalating water, food, and energy demands due to rapid development. Meanwhile, climate change and dam development intensify the security issues of these water-related resources. These changes have resulted in flow regime variations that may affect local hydroecological conditions (HEC) further influencing the ecosystem and have resulted in potential economic losses (especially agricultural losses caused by natural hazards). This study explores the impacts of dam development and climate change on baseline local HEC and natural hazard risk (NHR) using a coupled agent-based model that simulates interactions between autonomous agents in the whole basin. A cross-system analysis between the impact on baseline HEC and NHR is conducted to inform future policy in this transboundary basin. The impact on baseline HEC is evaluated from the flow regime variation perspective based on the Range of Variability Approach and the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration. The impact on NHR depends on variations in the risk of lowest flow and peak flow. The results primarily show that HEC and NHR in the upstream region are more sensitive to precipitation change. The negative impact on baseline HEC by joint dam development and climate change is more significant in the upstream region as well. Under the “hot and dry” climate condition, dam development can potentially mitigate both ecological and economic “loss” in the middle and downstream regions: Central and Southern Laos, the Kratie area, and Mekong Delta, if additional storage can be used in a flexible manner.",

      "abstract": "Study region Guadiana international catchment, located in the Iberian Peninsula. Study focus The Guadiana River catchment has registered an intense and speed up modification of its natural regime over the last few decades to cope with water scarcity. Such modifications pose a serious challenge to the development of improved management tools as information on available water resources is often not detailed enough. This study aimed to simulate the flow regime of the Guadiana River using the MOHID-Land model during a 30 years period. Two scenarios were defined by considering (or not) inputs from reservoirs. Model performance was assessed by comparing simulated and measured monthly streamflow at 24 hydrometric stations influenced (9 stations) or not (15 stations) by reservoir management. New hydrological insights for the region Streamflow simulations produced quite acceptable estimates for most of the hydrometric stations not influenced by reservoirs. However, results also showed the importance of non-simulated processes ( e.g ., groundwater abstractions) to the accurate prediction of the Guadiana flow regime. For the stations influenced by reservoir management, model simulations generally overestimated streamflow measurements. Information related to reservoir management needs thus to be made clearer for achieving better results, which can only be accomplished when national water agencies improve their cooperation protocols. Further model limitations were also addressed as well as the necessary developments for improving streamflow estimates in future modeling applications.",

      "abstract": "Challenges to manage and secure a sustainable water supply are expected to become more acute in Egypt as the lowermost riparian country of the Nile basin with the construction of new transboundary water infrastructures in Ethiopia and Sudan. To understand the impact of such transboundary water projects on Egypt, it is first necessary to develop a modeling tool that can simulate potential flow and reservoir scenarios inside Egypt without requiring in situ hydrologic or transboundary dam data that are typically unavailable. This study presents the water management value of a modeling framework to predict the current and future reservoir operating rules in the lower Nile basin using satellite Earth observations and hydrologic models. The platform comprises the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model driven by high spatial and temporal resolution of satellite observations. Reservoir storage change is estimated using altimeter and visible imagery of lake area for Lake Nasser and then applied to infer reservoir operation for High Aswan Dam (HAD). The modeling framework based on satellite observations yielded a simulated streamflow at the outlet for Blue Nile basin (BNB) with a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.68 with a correlation and RMSE of 0.94 and 1095 m 3 s −1 , respectively. Storage and outflow discharge of HAD were estimated for the period of 1998–2002 within 1.4% accuracy (0.076 km 3 month −1 ) when compared with published reports. Because BNB controls the lion’s share of the variability to HAD inflow inside Egypt, the proposed modeling framework is appropriate for policy-makers to understand the implications of transboundary projects on the future water security of Egypt.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Management",
      "citations": 38,
      "abstract": "Climate change leads to great impact on hydrological cycle and consequently affects water resources management. Historical strategies are no longer applicable under a changing environment. Therefore, adaptive management, especially adaptive operation rules for reservoirs, has been developed to mitigate the potential adverse impacts of climate change. However, previous studies generally provide a similar framework for adaptation strategies of individual reservoir without consideration of cascade reservoirs in the future scenario. This study derives adapting operation rules for cascade reservoir system based on future projections (2021-2100) of two global climate change models (GCMs). By using Pareto archived dynamically dimensioned search (PA-DDS) algorithm with maximization of water supply and power generation, the performance of the adaptive operation rule curves is compared with the designed operation rule. The results demonstrate that Pareto solutions of the PA-DDS algorithm provide a wider, more optimal range of annual power generation and water supply, and the projection pursuit method can select the best. The adaptive operation rules focusing on power generation can significantly increase the cascade reservoir annual power generation (by 3.7% in GCM-BCC or 4.8% in GCM-BNU), which shows that the proposed method can adapt future climate change.",

      "abstract": "Large-scale reservoirs play an essential role in water resources management for agriculture irrigation, water supply and flood controls. However, we need robust reservoir operation systems under both normal flow and extreme flow conditions. In this study, we applied recurrent neural networks (RNN) to simulate the operation of three multi-purpose reservoirs located in the upper Chao Phraya River basin. Two reservoirs have the function of multiannual flow regulation and one has the function of incomplete annual regulation. The goal of this study is to explore the applicability of RNN models for operation of reservoirs with multiannual flow regulation under different flow regimes, especially under extreme floods and droughts. We used three RNNs, namely nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous input (NARX), long short-term memory (LSTM) and genetic algorithm based NAXR (GA-NAXR) for reservoir operation based on historical data. For real-time water resources management, an accurate inflow forecast is required to provide a real-time reservoir outflow, and thus we also carried out a real-time reservoir operation using the RNN and the inflow forecast by a distributed hydrological model. Results show that (1) GA-NARX has the highest accuracy among three RNNs and is more stable than the original NARX by optimizing the initial conditions, although it takes longer training time than NARX and LSTM; (2) GA-NARX-based operation model is effective under extreme floods and droughts; and (3) the real-time operation system combining the GA-NARX and the distributed hydrological model has reasonable accuracy in both wet season and dry season. RNN-based operation model developed in this study has potential applicability in practical water management, and the model combining the hydrological prediction is specially useful for real-time reservoir operation.",

      "abstract": "Water management activities affect the terrestrial water cycle by increasing water supply and redistributing the water and energy budgets over irrigated agricultural land. However, the dynamics of how water management activities interact with the terrestrial water and energy budgets have not been sufficiently studied over Indian subcontinental Basins. In this study, we applied a well‐evaluated water management model, coupled with a large‐scale land surface hydrological model with irrigation and reservoir operation schemes to examine the impacts of irrigation and reservoir operations on terrestrial water and energy budgets over the Indian subcontinental basins. We conducted two simulations: NATURAL (i.e., no irrigation and no reservoirs) and water management scenario (i.e., with irrigation and with reservoir regulations, referred to as MANAGED) over 18 basins from 1951 to 2012. The water management impacts were evaluated by comparing a number of key water and energy budget terms such as evapotranspiration (ET), total runoff, land surface temperature (LST), latent heat flux (LHF), sensible heat flux (SHF), reservoir storage, and discharge. Our results show that water management activities have significant ( p value <0.05) impacts on ET, LHF, and LST in most of the river basins during the pre‐monsoon season (February–May). Comparing to the NATURAL scenario, ET and LHF under the MANAGED scenario are significantly increased in most basins during pre‐monsoon and post‐monsoon seasons, especially in semiarid regions. Therefore, the influence of irrigation on water and energy budget can be an overestimation in comparison to the constrained irrigation, which is a more realistic scenario.",

      "abstract": "Irrigation modulates the terrestrial water budget in intensively irrigated regions. However, the influence of irrigation on water budget and land surface temperature (LST) has not been quantified in Indian subcontinental river basins. Here, using the in situ and satellite‐based observations and the Variable Infiltration Capacity model with irrigation scheme, we show that the presence of irrigation substantially alters water budget (especially evapotranspiration, ET) and LST in the subcontinental river basins. While irrigation results in increased ET in all the 18 subcontinental basins, mean annual ET of Indus and Ganges basins increases by 47% and 12%, respectively, due to irrigation. Total runoff has increased in the most basins due to irrigation. Irrigation has a remarkable influence on LST with cooling of 0.2–0.65 °C. Compared to other basins, irrigation water demand is high in Indus and Ganges basins during the postmonsoon season (October–January). Our results show that between 1951 and 2012, irrigation demand has decreased in 13 out of the 18 basins during the premonsoon season (February–May). However, irrigation water demand increased in 12 out of the 18 basins in the postmonsoon season. Changes in irrigation demands are largely driven by changes in soil moisture due to weakening/strengthening of the summer monsoon precipitation. Our findings have implications for water budget estimation over intensively irrigated basins where ET might be substantially underestimated in the previous studies that do not consider the role of irrigation.",

      "journal": "Hydrology and Earth System Sciences",
      "citations": 19,
      "abstract": "Major multi-reservoir cascades represent a primary mechanism for dealing with hydrologic variability and extremes within institutionally complex river basins worldwide. These coordinated management processes fundamentally reshape water balance dynamics. Yet, multi-reservoir coordination processes have been largely ignored in the increasingly sophisticated representations of reservoir operations within large-scale hydrological models. The aim of this paper is twofold, namely (i) to provide evidence that the common modeling practice of parameterizing each reservoir in a cascade independently from the others is a significant approximation and (ii) to demonstrate potential unintended consequences of this independence approximation when simulating the dynamics of hydrological extremes in complex reservoir cascades. We explore these questions using the Water Balance Model, which features detailed representations of the human infrastructure coupled to the natural processes that shape water balance dynamics. It is applied to the Upper Snake River basin in the western US and its heavily regulated multi-reservoir cascade. We employ a time-varying sensitivity analysis that utilizes the method of Morris factor screening to explicitly track how the dominant release rule parameters evolve both along the cascade and in time according to seasonal high- and low-flow events. This enables us to address aim (i) by demonstrating how the progressive and cumulative dominance of upstream releases significantly dampens the ability of downstream reservoir rules' parameters to influence flow conditions. We address aim (ii) by comparing simulation results with observed reservoir operations during critical low-flow and high-flow events in the basin. Our time-varying parameter sensitivity analysis with the method of Morris clarifies how independent single-reservoir parameterizations and their tacit assumption of independence leads to reservoir release behaviors that generate artificial water shortages and flooding, whereas the observed coordinated cascade operations avoided these outcomes for the same events. To further explore the role of (non-)coordination in the large deviations from the observed operations, we use an offline multi-reservoir water balance model in which adding basic coordination mechanisms drawn from the observed emergency operations is sufficient to correct the deficiencies of the independently parameterized reservoir rules from the hydrological model. These results demonstrate the importance of understanding the state-space context in which reservoir releases occur and where operational coordination plays a crucial role in avoiding or mitigating water-related extremes. Understanding how major infrastructure is coordinated and controlled in major river basins is essential for properly assessing future flood and drought hazards in a changing world.",

      "abstract": "Multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs generally need to adjust operational functions for different storage levels; most existing reservoir schemes lack the pertinence to model the complex behaviors of such reservoirs. This paper proposes an improved operation-based reservoir scheme to simulate the storage and outflow variations for multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs at a daily time step. In this improved reservoir scheme, the new parametric functions to represent the weights of the outflow through considering various operation purposes (e.g., hydropower generation, flood control, and water supply) are introduced. Then, the improved reservoir scheme is integrated into a macroscale hydrological model, i.e., Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. In this study, the performance of the proposed reservoir scheme is evaluated with the observed storage and outflow of a multiyear and multipurpose reservoir (Xinfengjiang Reservoir) in South China and compared to two other reservoir schemes (i.e., a multilinear regression reservoir scheme and an operation-based reservoir scheme). In addition, through uncertainty analysis, this study shows that the time-varying operation-based parameters can reflect the changes of reservoir storage but not reservoir outflow, indicating that the parameters for establishing functional relationships need further exploration. Results reveal that the proposed reservoir scheme has a wide applicability for reservoir storage and outflow simulation, especially for the reservoirs with limited reservoir management data.",

In recent years, in order to enhance the potential of SWAT code maintenance and future development, a completely reconstructed version of SWAT, dubbed SWAT+, has been just released. In addition to the new model structure in SWAT+, reservoir operation functions have been added to improve the performance of model simulations. Before conducting watershed-scale model simulations, reservoir functions of SWAT+ were further coupled with the automatic calibration tool, IPEAT, to better consider the interactions among reservoir parameters and the corresponding hydrologic processes. In this study, a total of 123 reservoirs were simulated at daily scale across the contiguous United States (CONUS). A series of reference values of reservoir parameters (total 15) were categorized based on different classifications: (i) reservoir capacity; (ii) reservoir release; (iii) climate conditions; and, (iv) reservoir storage and release. Overall results showed that the performance of reservoir simulations at daily scales is satisfactory by commonly adopted statistical measures. In different scenarios, SfNFD (seasonal flood control drawdown days during non-flood season) (from 5 to 126 days), EfFLD (exclusive flood control drawdown days) (from 0.1 to 2.1 days) and EfFLC (exclusive flood control constant flow) (from 4.8 to 6.5 ha-m) are sensitive parameters and the converged parameter ranges were close to each other but not for other parameters. The recommended parameter ranges may be embedded by varying sources of uncertainty. However, the proposed calibration guidelines provide fast and accessible reference for future SWAT+ studies especially in subjects related to reservoir operations.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 81,
      "abstract": "Climate change, which impacts the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources, has a significant influence on the future hydropower generation. Studying the future evolution pattern of hydropower generation under climate change is of great significance for the medium- and long-term hydropower prediction. The objective of this paper is to predict the future hydropower generation of large-scale reservoir groups under climate change. The innovation of this paper is that the macro-scale distributed hydrological model combined with the optimal operation model of large-scale reservoirs was proposed for hydropower generation prediction. The established model considers the specific operation processes of large-scale reservoir groups, including 62 reservoirs in the case study. First, the Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) was built, and the evolution trend of future rainfall and temperature was predicted. Second, the macro-scale distributed Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model was built to predict the future runoff. Finally, the optimal operation generation model of large-scale reservoir groups was established to predict the trends of hydropower generation under climate change. Results demonstrate that under RCP2.6 scenario, there is no significant increase or decrease trend of hydropower generation in the future. But under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, the hydropower generation shows a growing trend, and the increase trend under RCP8.5 scenario is more obvious than that under RCP4.5 scenario. Thus, the development of hydropower generation is sensitive to climate change. This study can provide a reference for the long-term prediction of hydropower generation capacity in the upper Yangtze River Basin.",

      "citations": 131,
      "abstract": "During the past decades, the increased impact of anthropogenic interventions on river basins has prompted hydrologists to develop various approaches for representing human–water interactions in large-scale hydrological and land surface models. The simulation of water reservoir storage and operations has received particular attention, owing to the ubiquitous presence of dams. Yet, little is known about (1) the effect of the representation of water reservoirs on the parameterization of hydrological models, and, therefore, (2) the risks associated with potential flaws in the calibration process. To fill in this gap, we contribute a computational framework based on the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, which we use to calibrate VIC's parameters. An important feature of our framework is a novel variant of VIC's routing model that allows us to simulate the storage dynamics of water reservoirs. Using the upper Mekong river basin as a case study, we calibrate two instances of VIC – with and without reservoirs. We show that both model instances have the same accuracy in reproducing daily discharges (over the period 1996–2005), a result attained by the model without reservoirs by adopting a parameterization that compensates for the absence of these infrastructures. The first implication of this flawed parameter estimation stands in a poor representation of key hydrological processes, such as surface runoff, infiltration, and baseflow. To further demonstrate the risks associated with the use of such a model, we carry out a climate change impact assessment (for the period 2050–2060), for which we use precipitation and temperature data retrieved from five global circulation models (GCMs) and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5). Results show that the two model instances (with and without reservoirs) provide different projections of the minimum, maximum, and average monthly discharges. These results are consistent across both RCPs. Overall, our study reinforces the message about the correct representation of human–water interactions in large-scale hydrological models.",

      "abstract": "Questions related to historical and future water resources and scarcity have been addressed by several macroscale hydrological models. One of these models is the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. However, further model developments were needed to holistically assess anthropogenic impacts on global water resources using VIC.Our study developed VIC-WUR, which extends the VIC model using (1) integrated routing, (2) surface and groundwater use for various sectors (irrigation, domestic, industrial, energy, and livestock), (3) environmental flow requirements for both surface and groundwater systems, and (4) dam operation. Global gridded datasets on sectoral demands were developed separately and used as an input for the VIC-WUR model.Simulated national water withdrawals were in line with reported Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) national annual withdrawals (adjusted R2 > 0.8), both per sector and per source. However, trends in time for domestic and industrial water withdrawal were mixed compared with previous studies. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies were well represented (global mean root-mean-squared error, RMSE, values of 1.9 and 3.5 mm for annual and interannual anomalies respectively), whereas groundwater depletion trends were overestimated. The implemented anthropogenic impact modules increased simulated streamflow performance for 370 of the 462 anthropogenically impacted Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) monitoring stations, mostly due to the effects of reservoir operation. An assessment of environmental flow requirements indicates that global water withdrawals have to be severely limited (by 39 %) to protect aquatic ecosystems, especially with respect to groundwater withdrawals.VIC-WUR has potential for studying the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic developments on current and future water resources and sector-specific water scarcity. The additions presented here make the VIC model more suited for fully integrated worldwide water resource assessments.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 35,
      "abstract": "Reservoirs have been continuously built in the Poyang Lake Basin (PLB) for the local economy. With pending removal and reconstruction of aging reservoirs and planning of new reservoirs in this area, it is advisable to evaluate the likely impact of the existing and alternative reservoir network layouts on the hydrologic regime for more effective water resources planning and management. In this study, reservoirs of multiple sizes in the PLB were integrated into a coupled land surface-hydrologic model (CLHMS) fully coupled with a reservoir scheme. The extended model was then validated and applied to investigate the impact of existing reservoirs. Seven hypothetical scenarios were additionally set up by removing all the reservoirs, replacing smaller reservoirs with few larger ones, replacing larger reservoirs with many smaller ones, moving all reservoirs downstream or upstream, increasing or decreasing the mean inflow of reservoirs, respectively. In all, eight simulations were conducted and analyzed using the Indictors of Hydrologic Alterations (IHA) for the period of 1981–1999. Results indicate that the existing reservoirs in the PLB are able to effectively displace the excessive streamflow in the wet season to the dry season and mitigate the hydrological extremes. By increasing the mean inflow of reservoirs, the effectiveness of reservoirs in downstream flow regulation can be further enhanced. Similarly, replacing many small reservoirs with a few large ones with a same total capacity can lead to more resiliency against the downstream flow variability and extremes, only if the total mean inflow of the new large reservoirs is not considerably lower than that of the small ones. Relocating reservoirs to a different place with similar mean inflow, however, has a relatively minor and probably case-dependent impact on the hydrologic regime. On the other hand, the ecological analysis on the IHA parameters indicates that the layout preferable for the effective flow regulation may not necessarily be ecologically preferable. In general, this study comprehensively evaluates the hydrological impact of reservoir network layouts, and can provide implications for stakeholders to reach a trade-off between reservoir capacity distribution, locations and mean inflow not only in the PLB but also in different regions worldwide.",

      "abstract": "The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model is one of the most extensively used watershed-scale models across the world. In recent years, in order to enhance the potential of SWAT code maintenance and future development, a completely reconstructed version of SWAT, dubbed SWAT+, has been just released. In addition to the new model structure in SWAT+, reservoir operation functions have been added to improve the performance of model simulations. Before conducting watershed-scale model simulations, reservoir functions of SWAT+ were further coupled with the automatic calibration tool, IPEAT, to better consider the interactions among reservoir parameters and the corresponding hydrologic processes. In this study, a total of 123 reservoirs were simulated at daily scale across the contiguous United States (CONUS). A series of reference values of reservoir parameters (total 15) were categorized based on different classifications: (i) reservoir capacity; (ii) reservoir release; (iii) climate conditions; and, (iv) reservoir storage and release. Overall results showed that the performance of reservoir simulations at daily scales is satisfactory by commonly adopted statistical measures. In different scenarios, SfNFD (seasonal flood control drawdown days during non-flood season) (from 5 to 126 days), EfFLD (exclusive flood control drawdown days) (from 0.1 to 2.1 days) and EfFLC (exclusive flood control constant flow) (from 4.8 to 6.5 ha-m) are sensitive parameters and the converged parameter ranges were close to each other but not for other parameters. The recommended parameter ranges may be embedded by varying sources of uncertainty. However, the proposed calibration guidelines provide fast and accessible reference for future SWAT+ studies especially in subjects related to reservoir operations.",

      "citations": 85,
      "abstract": "Numerous studies have examined the changes in streamflow in the Mekong River Basin (MRB) using observations and hydrological modeling; however, there is a lack of integrated modeling studies that explicitly simulate the natural and human‐induced changes in flood dynamics over the entire basin. Here we simulate the river‐floodplain‐reservoir inundation dynamics over the MRB for 1979–2016 period using a newly integrated, high‐resolution (~5 km) river hydrodynamics‐reservoir operation model. The framework is based on the river‐floodplain hydrodynamic model CaMa‐Flood in which a new reservoir operation scheme is incorporated by including 86 existing MRB dams. The simulated flood extent is downscaled to a higher resolution (~90 m) to investigate fine‐scale inundation dynamics, and results are validated with ground‐ and satellite‐based observations. It is found that the historical variations in surface water storage have been governed primarily by climate variability; the impacts of dams on river‐floodplain hydrodynamics were marginal until 2009. However, results indicate that the dam impacts increased noticeably in 2010 when the basin‐wide storage capacity doubled due to the construction of new mega dams. Further, results suggest that the future flood dynamics in the MRB would be considerably different than in the past even without climate change and additional dams. However, it is also found that the impacts of dams can largely vary depending on reservoir operation strategies. This study is expected to provide the basis for high‐resolution river‐floodplain‐reservoir modeling for a holistic assessment of the impacts of dams and climate change on the floodpulse‐dependent hydro‐ecological systems in the MRB and other global regions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Present study assesses the effect of finer land-use classification in simulating the rainfall-runoff response of Kangsabati reservoir catchment (3,627 km 2 ) and command (7,112 km 2 ) by considering cropland heterogeneity in variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model. High resolution LISS-IV satellite imageries were used for the land-use classification. Global sensitivity analysis was performed using VIC-ASSIST to identify the most and least influential parameters based on the sensitivity index of elementary effects. A fully distributed calibration approach was employed using 16 (detailed) and 8 (lumped) vegetation classes. Low flows during lean periods were over-estimated and peak flows were under-estimated by both the model setups at Kangsabati reservoir site. Detailed land-use classification resulted in the reduction in streamflow over-estimation (Percent Bias (PBIAS) from −20.99 to −14.41 during calibration and from –22.83 to –7.17 during validation) at daily time step. It further demonstrates the improvement in simulating the peak flows; hence, highlighting the importance of detailed land-use classification for vegetation parameterization in VIC model setup. River discharge regulation at Kangsabati reservoir resulted in poor model performance at Mohanpur, downstream site of Kangsabati reservoir. Therefore, calibration for Mohanpur was performed after updating the VIC simulated streamflow with routed reservoir spillage using Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model. Streamflow updation employing HEC-RAS at Mohanpur improved the modelling efficiency (Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) from 0.50 to 0.65 during calibration and from 0.55 to 0.67 during validation) and reduced bias (PBIAS from 6.25 to –2.23 during calibration and from 15.06 to 7.40 during validation) considerably for daily flows. Model performance with reasonable accuracy was achieved at both the calibration locations which demonstrates the potential applicability of VIC model to predict streamflow in the monsoon dominated Kangsabati reservoir catchment and command. Highlights LISS-IV satellite imageries were classified using ground truth survey data obtained for different crop types in the study area Crop specific vegetation parameterization was used in setting up VIC modeling framework Modeling efficacy was assessed for two vegetation parameterization schemes using single crop type and multiple crops Global sensitivity analysis and fully distributed automatic calibration was performed using VIC-ASSIST software package Utility of HEC-RAS was shown in routing reservoir spillage to the downstream gauging point in VIC modeling framework in the absence of integrated reservoir module",

This regulation routine is integrated into the Hydrological Predictions for the Environment (HYPE) hydrologic model, used for continental-scale applications. Applying this daily timestep regulation routine at 19 reservoirs in the Arctic Ocean watershed, performance is shown to improve upon the reservoir regulation currently available in the HYPE model when testing outflow and storage Nash Sutcliffe Efficiencies (NSEs). Improvements stem from intra-annually variable storage rule curves and a variety of stage-dependent outflow functions, improving simulation skill (median NSE increases of 0.18 over 21 reservoir outflow records and 0.49 over 19 reservoir storage records). This new, reservoir regulation routine is suitable for continental-scale modelling by deriving varying, rather than fixed, threshold water surface levels and associated outflow rules in a programmatic way for multiple reservoirs.",

      "abstract": "Developing an ensemble hydrological prediction system is essential for reservoir operations and flood early warning. However, efforts to build hydrological ensemble prediction systems considering the influence of reservoirs have been lacking in India. We examine the potential of the Extended Range Forecast System (ERFS, 16 ensemble members) and Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS, 21 ensemble members) forecast for streamflow prediction in India using the Narmada River Basin as a test bed. We use the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) with reservoir operations (VIC-Res) scheme to simulate the daily river flow at four locations in the Narmada Basin. Streamflow prediction skills of the ERFS forecast were examined for the period 2003-2018 at 1-32 d lead. We compared the streamflow forecast skills of raw meteorological forecasts from ERFS and GEFS at a 1-10 d lead for the summer monsoon (June-September) 2019-2020. The ERFS forecast underestimates extreme precipitation against the observations compared to the GEFS forecast during the summer monsoon of 2019-2020. However, both forecast products show better skills for minimum and maximum temperatures than precipitation. Ensemble streamflow forecast from the GEFS performs better than the ERFS during 2019-2020. The performance of GEFS-based ensemble streamflow forecast declines after 5 days lead. Overall, the GEFS ensemble streamflow forecast can provide reliable skills at a 1-5 d lead, which can be utilized in streamflow prediction. Our findings provide directions for developing a flood early warning system based on ensemble streamflow prediction considering the influence of reservoirs in India.",

      "abstract": "Dams and reservoirs predictably alter the discharge of a river often confounding large-scale flow simulations. The Routing Application for Parallel computatIon of Discharge (RAPID) model has been widely used operationally. Until recently, RAPID could only represent reservoir outflow by directly specifying discharges from dams. Herein, we develop a non-data driven reservoir routing approach within RAPID. Results are comprehensively evaluated across the entire Mississippi River Basin (MRB). The reservoir routing resulted in considerable improvement in the Lower Mississippi and Arkansas-White-Red regions. Further, the accuracy of estimated reservoir releases also benefits when the inflow estimation improves. Simulation of the reservoir release with observed reservoir inflow resulted in highest Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) among all experiments. Inclusion of reservoir routing in RAPID will enhance the utility of this model in basins where dams exist and more importantly, improves streamflow predictions by providing better hydrological information for decision makers.",

      "abstract": "The calibration of macroscale hydrological models is often challenged by the lack of adequate observations of river discharge and infrastructure operations. This modeling backdrop creates a number of potential pitfalls for model calibration, potentially affecting the reliability of hydrological models. Here, we introduce a novel numerical framework conceived to explore and overcome these pitfalls. Our framework consists of VIC-Res (a macroscale model setup for the Upper Mekong Basin), which is a novel variant of the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model that includes a module for representing reservoir operations, and a hydraulic model used to infer discharge time series from satellite data. Using these two models and global sensitivity analysis, we show the existence of a strong relationship between the parameterization of the hydraulic model and the performance of VIC-Res – a codependence that emerges for a variety of performance metrics that we considered. Using the results provided by the sensitivity analysis, we propose an approach for breaking this codependence and informing the hydrological model calibration, which we finally carry out with the aid of a multi-objective optimization algorithm. The approach used in this study could integrate multiple remotely sensed observations and is transferable to other poorly gauged and heavily regulated river basins.",

      "journal": "Water Resources Research",
      "citations": 21,
      "abstract": "Assessments of water and energy security over historical and future periods require hydrologic models that can accurately simulate reservoir operations. However, scare reservoir operation data limits the accuracy of current reservoir representations in simulating reservoir behaviors. Furthermore, the reliability of these representations under changing inflow regimes remains unclear, which makes their application for long future planning horizons questionable. To this end, we propose a synergistic framework to predict the release, storage, and hydropower production of ungauged reservoirs (i.e., reservoirs without in‐situ inflow, release, storage, and operating rules) by combining remotely sensed reservoir operating patterns and model‐simulated reservoir inflow with conceptual reservoir operation schemes within a land surface‐hydrologic model. A previously developed reservoir operation scheme is extended with a storage anomaly based calibration approach to accommodate the relatively short time series and large time intervals of remotely sensed data. By setting up controlled experiments in the Yalong River Basin in China, we show that remote sensing can improve the parameter estimation and simulations of ungauged reservoirs for all selected reservoir operation schemes, thereby improving the downstream flood and streamflow simulations. However, most of these schemes show degraded accuracies of reservoir operation simulations under a changing inflow regime, which could lead to unreliable assessments of future water resources and hydropower production. In comparison, our newly extended reservoir operation scheme can be more adaptable to flow regime variations. Our study provides a practical framework for reservoir impact assessments and predictions with the ongoing satellite altimetry projects such as Surface Water and Ocean Topography.",

      "abstract": "Utilizing simulated daily flow values for 61 948 stream nodes from the National Water Model (NWM) v.2.1 retrospective data set, which covers the period 1979–2020, streamflow peaks (SFP) were determined using an objective threshold method based on the Fisher‐Jenks breakpoint algorithm. This approach provides estimates of low probability, high in‐channel water level conditions. Strong spatial relations in temporal streamflow peak distribution were observed, with four main spatial clusters covering: (1) the central parts of Mississippi to South Carolina; (2) the south and north parts of Mississippi to South Carolina; (3) Florida, the Gulf Coast, and parts of North Carolina and Virginia; and (4) the Atlantic Coast and parts of the Gulf Coast. The first area is characterized by high multiannual SFP occurrence with long total durations, high contribution to total discharge, and occurrence throughout the year with peaks in February and March. Increasing annual peak trends are present locally. The second area is characterized by similar parameters with increased flash flooding potential. In the third area, lower occurrence and share in total discharge are observed, with two peaks of occurrence in the September–October and March periods. In the fourth region, the lowest occurrences and shortest durations are present, along with strong seasonality manifested in September–October occurrences that constitute over 80% of all SFP volumes. Decreasing trends in maximal monthly flows for the June–October period are also observed here. The results provide valuable regionalized information about historical high flow characteristics across the southeast United States, which can be used as a basis for improved long‐term flood prediction based on seasonality models and constitute a baseline for defining regional changes in high flow frequency and distribution.",

      "abstract": "This study introduced a clustered polynomial chaos expansion (CPCE) model to reveal random propagation and dynamic sensitivity of uncertainty parameters in hydrologic prediction. In the CPCE model, the random characteristics of the streamflow simulations resulting from parameter uncertainties are characterized through the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) model based on the probabilistic collocation method. At the same time, a multivariate discrete non-functional relationship between PCE coefficients and hydrological model inputs is established based on stepwise cluster analysis. Therefore, compared with traditional PCE method, the developed CPCE model cannot only reflect uncertainty propagation in stochastic hydrological simulation, but also have the capability of random forecasting. Moreover, the dynamic sensitivities of model parameters are investigated through the multilevel factorial analyses. The developed approach was applied for streamflow forecasting for the Ruihe watershed, China. Results showed that with effective quantification for the random characteristics of hydrological processes, the CPCE model can directly predict runoff series and generate the associated probability distributions at different time periods. The dynamic sensitivity analysis indicates that the maximum soil moisture capacity within the catchment plays a key role in the accuracy of the low-flow forecasting, while the degree of spatial variability in soil moisture capacities has a remarkable impact on the accuracy of the high-flow forecasting in the studied watershed.",

      "abstract": "Flooding in the Amazon basin is frequently attributed to modes of large-scale climate variability, but little attention is paid to how these modes influence the timing and duration of floods despite their importance to early warning systems and the significant impacts that these flood characteristics can have on communities. In this study, river discharge data from the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS 2.1) and observed data at 58 gauging stations are used to examine whether positive or negative phases of several Pacific and Atlantic indices significantly alter the characteristics of river flows throughout the Amazon basin (1979–2015). Results show significant changes in both flood magnitude and duration, particularly in the north-eastern Amazon for negative El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases when the sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly is positioned in the central tropical Pacific. This response is not identified for the eastern Pacific index, highlighting how the response can differ between ENSO types. Although flood magnitude and duration were found to be highly correlated, the impacts of large-scale climate variability on these characteristics are non-linear; some increases in annual flood maxima coincide with decreases in flood duration. The impact of flood timing, however, does not follow any notable pattern for all indices analysed. Finally, observed and simulated changes are found to be much more highly correlated for negative ENSO phases compared to the positive phase, meaning that GloFAS struggles to accurately simulate the differences in flood characteristics between El Niño and neutral years. These results have important implications for both the social and physical sectors working towards the improvement of early warning action systems for floods.",

      "abstract": "Study region Sixty-four river gauging stations distributed over Sweden. Study focus To investigate the influence of climate teleconnection patterns (TP) on streamflow in Sweden. Streamflow data is regionalized and the average hydrographs of each homogeneous region is divided into hydrological seasons. Thereafter the impact of different TPs on the streamflow, per homogeneous region and per hydrological season is analyzed. New hydrological insights for the region Five homogeneous regions are identified; three located in the north, where snow dominates the hydrological processes, and two located in the south, where rain dominates hydrological processes. The northern hydrographs are separated into three hydrological periods: low streamflow when snow is accumulated, high streamflow during the melting of the snowpack and a transition period in between. The southern hydrographs are characterized by streamflow above the yearly average during the winter and below during the summer. Hydrological periods in different homogeneous regions are influenced by diverse combinations of TPs. Arctic Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation and Scandinavian Pattern influence the streamflow in most of the regions during most hydrological periods. The further south and east the region is located, the more TPs influence the streamflow. The resulting streamflow variability is related to the interplay between different TPs both before and during each hydrological period. This interplay may enhance or decrease the individual influence of each TP on streamflow.",

      "abstract": "The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) teleconnection is often cited as the leading mode of climate variability in Great Britain. The NAO has been found to produce significant rainfall deviations that vary in space and time. This study sought to analyse the effect of the NAO at the catchment scale across a large number of catchments in Great Britain across a long study period (1900–2015). We first quantify the effect of the NAO on rainfall and streamflow at a monthly scale, revealing distinctive spatio-temporal patterns under positive and negative phases of the NAO. Through a comparison of correlation analyses we also explore whether catchment characteristics moderate the propagation of NAO–rainfall deviations to streamflow, and classify catchments based on their resilience and susceptibility to NAO–rainfall deviations. In summary, our analyses combined contribute to an improved understanding of the hydrometeorological impact of the NAO in British catchments.",

      "abstract": "This study describes a comprehensive investigation of the contiguous United States precipitation patterns in relation to the warm and cold phases of El Niño/southern Oscillation (ENSO) using a set of empirical and statistical analyses, such as harmonic analysis, annual cycle composites, and cross-correlation analysis. Monthly precipitation composites for the first harmonic, covering 24-month ENSO events, are formed for all climate divisions over the United States spanning up to 29 ENSO episodes. From the harmonic vectorial maps plotted on the study area, each vector reveals both intensity and temporal phase of the ENSO-related precipitation teleconnection, and the corresponding candidate and core regions are determined using a machine learning technique of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based on magnitude and temporal phase of climate signal, and Köppen climate classification. As a result of vectorial mapping, five core regions were designated as North-West region (NW), South-West region (SW), Middle-Inland region (MI), South-East region (SE), and North-East region (NE). During fall (0) to spring (+) seasons, the results of this analysis show below (above) normal precipitation response to the El Niño events at the NW region (SW, MI, SE, and NE regions), while the opposite patterns are detected for the cold phase of ENSO. The temporal consistency values were 0.72 to 0.86 (0.77 to 0.82), and spatial coherence values ranged from 0.96 to 0.99 (0.94 to 0.99) for the warm (cold) events. Comparative analyses of precipitation responses to both El Niño and La Niña events reveal the high significance level of the ENSO-related precipitation signals with an opposite tendency in monthly precipitation anomalies. Positive precipitation anomalies during the El Niño thermal forcing are more significant than negative precipitation departures during the La Niña events. Consequently, middle latitude precipitation responses to the El Niño/La Niña phenomena are detectable over the contiguous United States.",

      "journal": "Earth's Future",
      "citations": 14,
      "abstract": "Summer heatwaves over Europe, which can cause many deaths and severe damage, have become increasingly frequent over central and eastern Europe and western Russia in recent decades. In this paper, we estimate the contributions of the warming due to increased greenhouse gases (GHG) and nonlinear variations correlated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) to the observed heatwave trend over Europe during 1980–2021, when the GHG‐induced warming over Europe exhibits a linear trend. It is found that GHG‐induced warming contributes to ∼57% of the European heatwave trend over 1980–2021, while the cold‐to‐warm phase shift of the AMO‐like variations accounts for ∼43% of the trend via the intensification of midlatitude North Atlantic jet. The recent trend of heatwaves over western and northern Europe is mainly due to GHG‐induced warming, while that over central and eastern Europe and western Russia is primarily related to the combined effect of the AMO‐like variations and GHG‐induced warming. To some extent, GHG‐induced warming is an amplifier of the increasing trend of recent AMO‐related European heatwaves. Moreover, European blocking (Ural blocking, UB) is shown to contribute to 55% (42%) of the AMO‐related heatwave trend via the influence of midlatitude North Atlantic jet. In the presence of a strong North Atlantic jet during the recent warm AMO phase, UB events concurrent with positive‐phase North Atlantic Oscillation can cause intense, persistent and widespread heatwaves over Europe such as that observed in the summer of 2022.",

      "journal": "Nature Water",
      "citations": 5,
      "abstract": "A large proportion of western North America experiences regular water stress, compounded by high seasonal and interannual variability. In the Intermountain West region, the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a critical control on winter precipitation, but the nature of this signal is entangled with a combination of orographic effects and long-term climate trends. This study employs a spatially distributed, nonlinear spline model to isolate ENSO impacts from these other factors using gauge-based observations starting in 1871. In contrast to previous modelling approaches, our approach uses original gauge data, without shortening the record to accommodate a common period. This enables more detailed separation of ENSO effects from the confounding influence of topography and long-term trends, whereas the longer time frame permits more robust correlation with the ENSO signal. Here we show that the complex topography of the Intermountain West exaggerates the underlying ENSO signal, producing a 2.3–5.8 times increase in the range of ENSO-induced precipitation changes along high-elevation western slopes relative to lower elevations. ENSO effects on winter precipitation can be as large as ± 100 mm at high elevations. Further, our approach reveals that the previously recognized dipolar pattern of positive (negative) association of ENSO with precipitation in the south (north) manifests as an incremental relationship in the south but as a near-binary switch in effects between El Niño and La Niña in the north. The location and extent of the strongest precipitation differences vary during the positive and negative ENSO phases within each region. The intricacies of these spatial- and elevation-based modulations of ENSO impacts are especially informative for the northern centre of this dipole, where ENSO-precipitation relationships have previously been difficult to resolve.",

      "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",
      "citations": 33,
      "abstract": "Depending on the concept of optimality, the decision makers responsible for the planning and management of water resources seek to maximize the optimization performance. However, the optimized solutions are vulnerable to failure because decision making in water resources management usually involves factors with deep uncertainties (e.g. runoff conditions, water demand growth, climatic forces, etc.). In this study, we further contribute to the Many-Objective Robust Decision Making framework for defining the robust operating rules of a water supply system of interest. The multi-objective optimization and uncertainty analysis tools were used to reveal the trade-offs between the competing objectives and discover the sensitive factors for the plausible states of the system, respectively. The robust operating rules are demonstrated for the Han to Wei inter-basin water transfer project, which is the most important water diversion project in Shaanxi Province, China. Results show that, although the current operating rules are optimized for the water supply system over the long term, these operating rules cannot deal with the problem of performance degradation under deep uncertainties associated with runoff conditions and water demand growth. The two uncertain factors are the sensitive factors responsible for the failure or success of the system, and robustness of the system may be achieved by reducing the effect of key uncertainties (e.g. reduced water demand growth). Furthermore, there are obvious differences in the robust operating rules across different months, with the key or sensitive months providing the uncertain ranges to likely sustain the success of the system. Finally, the successful frequency of the system derived from the most robust operating rules is 18% higher than that obtained from the current operating rules for alternative states of the world. The robust operating rules offer critical insights into the challenges posed by deep uncertainties and provide a management template for decision making on climate change and complex human activities.",

      "abstract": "An integrated framework is proposed for parametric uncertainty analysis in hydrological modeling using a generalized polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) approach. PCE represents model output as a polynomial expression in terms of critical random variables that are determined by parameter uncertainties, thus offers an efficient way of sampling without running the original model, which is appealing to computationally expensive models. To demonstrate the applicability of generalized PCE approach, both second- and third-order PCEs (PCE-2 and PCE-3) are constructed for Xinanjiang hydrological model using three selected uncertain parameters. Uncertainties in streamflow predictions are assessed by sampling the random inputs. Results show that: (1) both PCE-2 and PCE-3 are capable of capturing the uncertainty information in hydrological predictions, generating consistent mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis estimates with the standard Monte Carlo (MC) methodology; (2) Using more collocation points and more polynomial terms, PCE-3 approximation slightly improves the model simulation and provides more matched distribution with that of MC compared to PCE-2; (3) the computational cost using the PCE approach is greatly reduced by 71% (20%) with PCE-2 (PCE-3). In general, PCE-2 is recommended to serve as a good surrogate model for Xinanjiang hydrological modelling in future with much higher computation speed, more efficient sampling, and compatible approximation results.",

      "citations": 25,
      "abstract": "The predictions made using rainfall-runoff models are inherently uncertain and it is important to recognize and account for this uncertainty, especially in urban watersheds due to the high flood risk in these areas. Recent studies on hydrological model uncertainty mostly refer to the identification of model parameter uncertainty. However, such studies are somewhat limited using the bootstrap approach, a nonparametric method which makes less prior assumptions on the model structure and thus is more flexible. Hence, a residual-based bootstrap approach associated with the SCE-UA global optimization algorithm is demonstrated in this study for the analysis of calibrated parameter uncertainty and its subsequent effect on the model simulation of an urban-specific rainfall-runoff model, urban storage function (USF) model, under two different data scenarios of individual event-based and whole data-based scenarios. Initially, the parameter uncertainty was expressed by estimating the confidence interval (CI) of the USF model parameters obtained from bootstrapping and then the parameters from the highest to the lowest uncertainties were derived by utilizing two newly proposed parameter uncertainty indices which can make the best use of CI. Moreover, investigations on the effect of calibrated parameter uncertainty on model simulations revealed that the model was able to bracket most of the observations within the prediction range of considered scenarios. This further indicates that the residual-based bootstrap approach along with the SCE-UA method reasonably well predicted the uncertainty range of the USF model. For a better understanding of simulation uncertainty, we defined and demonstrated two model simulation uncertainty indices and these indices could be useful in future studies to analyze the simulation uncertainty of different rainfall-runoff models in the watersheds worldwide.",

The unknown parameters include those that have been identified as the most influential factors on the simulations of surface and subsurface runoff, latent and sensible heat fluxes, and soil moisture in CLM4.0. We set up the inversion problem in the Bayesian framework in two steps: (i) building a surrogate model expressing the input–output mapping, and (ii) performing inverse modeling and computing the posterior distributions of the input parameters using observation data for a given value of the output LH. The development of the surrogate model is carried out with a Bayesian procedure based on the variable selection methods that use gPC expansions. Our approach accounts for bases selection uncertainty and quantifies the importance of the gPC terms, and, hence, all of the input parameters, via the associated posterior probabilities.",

However, the uncertainty in their predictions and their reliability remains an open question. We present a novel method to evaluate the uncertainty of four popular entropy models, including Shannon, Shannon-Power Low (PL), Tsallis, and Renyi, in shear stress estimation in circular channels. The Bayesian Monte-Carlo (BMC) uncertainty method is simplified considering a 95% Confidence Bound (CB). We developed a new statistic index called as FREEopt-based OCB (FOCB) using the statistical indices Forecasting Range of Error Estimation (FREE) and the percentage of observed data in the CB (Nin), which integrates their combined effect. The Shannon and Shannon PL entropies had close values of the FOCB equal to 8.781 and 9.808, respectively, had the highest certainty in the calculation of shear stress values in circular channels followed by traditional uniform flow shear stress and Tsallis models with close values of 14.491 and 14.895, respectively. However, Renyi entropy with much higher values of FOCB equal to 57.726 has less certainty in the estimation of shear stress than other models. Using the presented results in this study, the amount of confidence in entropy methods in the calculation of shear stress to design and implement different types of open channels and their stability is determined.",

      "abstract": "Practitioners often neglect the uncertainty inherent to models and their inputs. Point Estimate Methods (PEMs) offer an alternative to the common, but computationally demanding, method for assessing model uncertainty, Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. PEMs rerun the model with representative values of the probability distribution of the uncertain variable. The results can estimate the statistical moments of the output distribution. Hong’s method is the specific PEM implemented here for a case study that simulates water runoff using the ANUGA model for an area in Glasgow, UK. Elevation is the source of uncertainty. Three realizations of the Sequential Gaussian Simulation, which produces the random error fields that can be used as inputs for any spatial model, are scaled according to representative values of the distribution and their weights. The output from a MC simulation is used for validation. A comparison of the first two statistical moments indicates that Hong’s method tends to underestimate the first moment and overestimate the second moment. Model efficiency performance measures validate the usefulness of Hong’s method for the approximation of the first two moments, despite the method suffering from outliers. Estimation was less accurate for higher moments but the moment estimates were sufficient to use the Grams-Charlier Expansion to fit a distribution to them. Regarding probabilistic flood-inundation maps, Hong’s method shows very similar probabilities in the same areas as the MC simulation. However, the former requires just three 11-minute simulation runs, rather than the 500 required for the MC simulation. Hong’s method therefore appears attractive for approximating the uncertainty of spatiotemporal models.",

      "citations": 26,
      "abstract": "Recent changes in climate, anthropogenic activities and land-use patterns have significantly altered the hydrological cycle and thus led to the presence of non-stationarity in hydrological data series. Existing conventional approaches for hydrological frequency analysis (HFA) have commonly overlooked non-stationarity and consequently they might produce false estimates of hydrological design events. Assessing the effect of non-stationarity through uncertainty quantification is a potentially feasible approach for HFA. This paper proposed to incorporate the particle filter (PF) into HFA (here flood frequency analysis (FFA) was exemplified) (named PF-FFA) for quantifying prediction uncertainty in flood quantile estimates. The feasibility of the PF-FFA was verified through comparison with the conventional L-moment based FFA (LM-FFA) as well as the random sampling based FFA (RS-FFA) in terms of both accuracy and precision respectively using several selected evaluation indices. Furthermore, the comparison of the use of constant and varying shape parameter in the PF-FFA demonstrated that the use of constant shape parameter would deteriorate the performance in both accuracy and precision, especially for datasets showing a high-level degree of non-stationarity. Through these elaborate investigations, the PF-FFA was shown to be an effective approach when dealing with non-stationary datasets as it successfully captured the effect of non-stationarity compared to the LM-FFA and RS-FFA.",

      "journal": "Water",
      "citations": 30,
      "abstract": "Water level modeling is a critical component of flood warning systems. A high-quality forecast requires the development of a hydraulic model that reliably accounts for the main sources of uncertainty. In this paper, a 1D hydraulic model with adaptive flow-based calibration was developed. This calibration resulted in roughness-flow relationships that allow Manning coefficients to be updated as a function of river flow, to limit errors throughout the flood cycle. An uncertainty analysis is then conducted for independent events, considering as the main source of uncertainty the error in the estimated input flows (upstream and lateral), and in the calibrated roughness coefficients. A set of parameters is generated by Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) from the characterization of these errors to evaluate their propagation to the variables of interest, namely water level and flow. These are evaluated by performance metrics (scores) such as the reliability diagram and the continuous rank probability score (CRPS). The adaptive flow-based calibration considerably reduced the error of the 1D model and improved its performance over time and throughout the flood events. The uncertainty analysis resulted in consistent accuracy improvements over a deterministic simulation with gains of 20% to 32%, depending on the combined parameters. Good reliability is also reached for most stations, with resulting spreads and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) close to one another. The proposed methodology has the potential to improve the descriptive capability of 1D river hydraulic models and to increase their reliability when included in forecasting systems",

      "abstract": "Reservoir inflow prediction is subject to high uncertainties in data-driven modelling. In this study, a decomposition scheme is proposed to evaluate the individual and combined contributions of uncertainties from input sets and data-driven models to the total predictive uncertainty. Six variables (i.e., inflow ( Q ), precipitation ( P ), relative humidity ( H ), minimum temperature ( Tmin ), maximum temperature ( Tmax ) and precipitation forecast ( F )), and three data-driven models (i.e., artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS)) are used to produce an ensemble of 10-day inflow forecast for Huanren reservoir in China, and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method is employed to decompose the uncertainty. The ensemble forecast results show that when the three variables, i.e., Q , P and F , are used only, the predictive accuracy of the data-driven models is very high and the addition of the other three variables, i. e., H , T min and T max, can slightly improve the predictive accuracy. The decomposition results indicate that the input set is the dominant source of uncertainty, the contribution of the data-driven model is limited and has a strong seasonal variation: larger in winter and summer, smaller in spring and autumn. Most importantly, the interactive contribution of the input set and the data-driven model to the total predictive uncertainty is very high and is more significant than the individual contribution from the model itself, implying that the combined effects of the input set and the data-driven model should be carefully considered in the modelling process.",

      "journal": "Water",
      "citations": 30,
      "abstract": "As a revolutionary tool leading to substantial changes across many areas, Machine Learning (ML) techniques have obtained growing attention in the field of hydrology due to their potentials to forecast time series. Moreover, a subfield of ML, Deep Learning (DL) is more concerned with datasets, algorithms and layered structures. Despite numerous applications of novel ML/DL techniques in discharge simulation, the uncertainty involved in ML/DL modeling has not drawn much attention, although it is an important issue. In this study, a framework is proposed to quantify uncertainty contributions of the sample set, ML approach, ML architecture and their interactions to multi-step time-series forecasting based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA) theory. Then a discharge simulation, using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), is taken as an example. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a state-of-the-art DL approach, was selected due to its outstanding performance in time-series forecasting, and compared with simple RNN. Besides, novel discharge forecasting architecture is designed by combining the expertise of hydrology and stacked DL structure, and compared with conventional design. Taking hourly discharge simulations of Anhe (China) catchment as a case study, we constructed five sample sets, chose two RNN approaches and designed two ML architectures. The results indicate that none of the investigated uncertainty sources are negligible and the influence of uncertainty sources varies with lead-times and discharges. LSTM demonstrates its superiority in discharge simulations, and the ML architecture is as important as the ML approach. In addition, some of the uncertainty is attributable to interactions rather than individual modeling components. The proposed framework can both reveal uncertainty quantification in ML/DL modeling and provide references for ML approach evaluation and architecture design in discharge simulations. It indicates uncertainty quantification is an indispensable task for a successful application of ML/DL.",

      "journal": "Agricultural Systems",
      "citations": 22,
      "abstract": "This study used the Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES)-Wheat model to explore the impact of parameter uncertainty and model structure on model output. We obtained observational and management data for winter wheat growth from an experiment conducted in Yangling, China, over 2012/13 and 2013/14, which we used for model input and evaluation. This experiment was conducted with full irrigation to avoid the effect of water stress on winter wheat growth. The Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) was used to generate 10,000 random parameter sets, including one calibrated parameter set, to explore the effects of parameter uncertainty on model output. Our results showed that GLUE-calibrated parameters were significantly different from observations. Further analysis indicated that frequent water stress occurred in the modeling results, even though no water stress actually occurred with full irrigation. This disagreement resulted mainly from the unrealistic water stress parameterization. GLUE-calibrated parameters matched very well with observations when this parameterization was closed in the CERES-Wheat model. Thus, the unrealistic water stress parameterization strongly affected the GLUE algorithm in locating calibrated parameters. The parameter sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the model errors produced by the water stress parameterization were compensated mainly by the parameters most sensitive to the winter wheat growth and yield simulations, such as the standard kernel weight and phyllochron. Hence, special attention should be paid to these parameters to identify possible structural defects in the model. In addition, results of the parameter uncertainty effect on model output showed that phenology-related simulations could better capture observations when multiple sets of parameters were used with and without water stress conditions. For the yield, maximum leaf area index, and final aboveground biomass, the model generally produced smaller biases without water stress than with water stress due to the unrealistic water stress parameterization. This study provides a better way for improving crop simulations and predictions.",

      "abstract": "Uncertainty assessment of parameters associated with non-point source pollution mechanism modeling are crucial for improving the effectiveness of pollution controlling. In this study, an approach based on Bayesian inference and integrated Markov chain Monte Carlo and multilevel factorial analysis has been developed, and it can not only apply straightforward Bayesian inference to assess parameter uncertainties, but also quantitatively investigate the main and interactive effects of multiple parameters on the model response variables by measuring the specific variations of model outputs. Its applicability and advantages are presented through the application of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to Shitoukoumen Reservoir Catchment in northeast China. This study investigated the uncertainties of a set of sensitive parameters and their multilevel effects on model response variables, including average annual runoff (AAR), average annual sediment (AAS) and average annual total nitrogen (AAN). Results revealed that (i) soil conservation service runoff curve number for moisture condition II (CN2) had a positive effect on all response variables; (ii) available water capacity of the soil layer (SOL_AWC) had a negative effect on all response variables; (iii) the universal soil loss equation support practice (USLE_P) had a positive effect on AAS and AAN, and little effect on AAR; while the nitrate percolation coefficient (NPERCO) had a positive effect on AAN, and little effect on AAS and AAR; and (iv) the interactions amongst parameters had obvious interdependent effects on the model response variables, for example, the interaction between CN2 and SOL_AWC had a major impact on AAR. The above findings can improve the simulating and predicting capabilities of non-point source pollution mechanism model. Overall, this study highlights that the proposed approach represents a promising solution for uncertainty assessment of model parameters in non-point source pollution mechanism modeling.",

The uncertainty analysis showed that the observed river flows were within the predicted bounds/envelope of 5% and 95% percentiles. These predicted river flow bounds contained most of the observed river flows, as expressed by the high containment ratio, CR. In addition to CR, other uncertainty indices – bandwidth B , relative bandwidth RB, degrees of asymmetry S and T , deviation amplitude D , relative deviation amplitude RD and the R factor – also indicated that the predicted river flows have acceptable uncertainty levels.

      "citations": 16,
      "abstract": "The uncertainty assessment of urban hydrological models is important for understanding the reliability of the simulated results. To satisfy the demand for urban flood management, we assessed the uncertainty of urban hydrological models from a multiple-objective perspective. A multiple-criteria decision analysis method, namely, the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation-Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (GLUE-TOPSIS) was proposed, wherein TOPSIS was adopted to measure the likelihood within the GLUE framework. Four criteria describing different urban stormwater characteristics were combined to test the acceptability of the parameter sets. The TOPSIS was used to calculate the aggregate employed in the calculation of the aggregate likelihood value. The proposed method was implemented in the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), which was applied to the Dahongmen catchment in Beijing, China. The SWMM model was calibrated and validated based on the three and two flood events respectively downstream of the Dahongmen catchment. The results showed that the GLUE-TOPSIS provided a more precise uncertainty boundary compared with the single-objective GLUE method. The band widths were reduced by 7.30 m3/s in the calibration period, and by 7.56 m3/s in the validation period. The coverages increased by 20.3% in the calibration period, and by 3.2% in the validation period. The median estimates improved, with an increase of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients by 1.6% in the calibration period, and by 10.0% in the validation period. We conclude that the proposed GLUE-TOPSIS is a valid approach to assess the uncertainty of urban hydrological model from a multiple objective perspective, thereby improving the reliability of model results in urban catchment.",

These require basin data and forcing data from different sources, which may be incommensurate. The study reported here calibrated the Variable Infiltration-Capacity (VIC) platform to quantify model result sensitivity to model parameters and uncertainty in those parameters. The modeled basin was the Diyala River in Iraq, above the Derbendikhan Dam. The study produced the first complete set of daily forcing data for the basin using different sources. Besides ground observations from the Iraqi Ministry of Water Resources, two additional data sources were tested: Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) and Global Implemented Data (GIDAL). Several methods were implemented to adjust the data, and model sensitivity and parameter uncertainty were examined by Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) and Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM). Neither of these techniques had been applied before in Iraq. The VIC model was then calibrated manually using Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE). The analyses indicate that neither TRMM nor GIDAL data are adequate for gridded precipitation analysis in the study basin. TRMM tends to underestimate and GIDAL tends to overestimate actual data. Multiplicative random cascade and Schaake Shuffle were used to determine daily precipitation data. A set of correction equations was developed to adjust GIDAL temperature and wind speed. Results for the GLUE and DREAM analyses imply that the depth of the second soil layer is the parameter that causes the most sensitivity in the model. The VIC model outputs were calibrated on a daily timescale with a KGE average of 0.743.",

      "abstract": "In this study, a two-stage fuzzy-stochastic factorial analysis (TFFA) method is developed and applied to the Vakhsh watershed (upper reaches of Aral Sea basin, Central Asia) for daily streamflow simulation. TFFA has advantages in identifying the major parameters that have important individual and interactive effects on model outputs, as well as assessing multiple uncertainties resulting from randomness and vagueness characteristics of model parameters. The results reveal that (a) nine major parameters (from a total of 24) have significant effects on Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) simulation performance for the study watershed; and (b) snowmelt-related parameters (including snowfall temperature, threshold temperature for snowmelt and s nowmelt factor) and runoff curve number (CN2) are most sensitive parameters for the runoff generation. The results also show that the proposed TFFA method can help enhance the hydrological model’s capability for runoff simulation/prediction, particularly for in data-scarce and high-mountainous watersheds.",

      "abstract": "Calibrated hydrological models forced with the climate data from various climate models have been widely employed for future streamflow projection. But a major cause of concern in such an analysis has been the suite of uncertainties inherent in the modeling chain that begins from the climate models and ends with the hydrological models. The uncertainties contributed by the hydrological models have generally been given a lesser focus. In the present research, the contribution of the hydrological model parameter uncertainty has been investigated. The multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is employed for calibrating the hydrological model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), developed for the Magpie River, located in Northern Ontario. The calibrated model was then forced with the data from an ensemble of six regional climate models for projecting the scenario streamflow and evaluating associated uncertainties. A significant variation in seasonal water availability is projected for the two scenario periods studied. The contribution of the hydrological model parameter uncertainty in the streamflow projection is found to be significant, lying in the range of 16%–83%, depending on the month.",

In this study, the effects of climate change on the hydrological drought characteristics of the Gharasu basin, as one of the major sub-basins of the Karkheh river basin, are investigated. This river basin has experienced severe droughts, and floods, in recent years. The uncertainties in projected drought conditions are characterized based on a suite of 34 general circulation models (GCMs). Based on hydrological simulations over the historical period, 12 GCMs are selected to estimate projected runoff values and the corresponding streamflow drought index (SDI) in the future period. The ‘run theory’ is applied to evaluate the drought characteristics under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 emission scenarios. Results show that uncertainties of drought projection under RCP8.5 are higher than under RCP4.5, where among different drought characteristics, the maximum uncertainty is detected for drought severity and maximum drought duration. Moreover, the uncertainty of drought projection in wet periods is greater than that in dry periods.",

However, the scale of the existing research is relatively small, which results from computational complexity and limited computing resources. In this study, a parallel GLUE method based on a Message-Passing Interface (MPI) was proposed and implemented on a supercomputer system. The research focused on the computational efficiency of the parallel algorithm and the parameter uncertainty of the Xinanjiang model affected by different threshold likelihood function values and sampling sizes. The results demonstrated that the parallel GLUE method showed high computational efficiency and scalability. Through the large-scale parameter uncertainty analysis, it was found that within an interval of less than 0.1%, the proportion of behavioral parameter sets and the threshold value had an exponential relationship. A large sampling scale is more likely than a small sampling scale to obtain behavioral parameter sets at high threshold values. High threshold values may derive more concentrated posterior distributions of the sensitivity parameters than low threshold values.",

In this study, the length of record (LOR) method is applied to analyse the uncertainty in the impact of different data lengths on the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) evaluation in the Jinsha River. The results indicate: (1) For the pre-impact period, a daily streamflow data length of 20 years should be required to meet all the indicators, but 5–10 years of data could be sufficient when analysing some specific indicators. (2) A logarithmic correlation was found between the LOR results and the coefficient of variation ( CV ) of the IHA statistics, which can be considered reference factors to reduce the computational complexity when we expect to obtain LOR results from other nearby hydrological stations. (3) For the post-impact period, using a data length of 10 years is sufficient to evaluate the impact of large reservoirs on the river hydrological regime, and the actual alteration of hydrological regime would be overestimated by using a shorter data length.",

      "citations": 41,
      "abstract": "Numerous studies have examined the reliability of various precipitation products over the Mekong River Basin (MRB) and modeled its basin hydrology. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies on precipitation‐induced uncertainties in hydrological simulations using process‐based land surface models. This study examines the propagation of precipitation uncertainty into hydrological simulations over the entire MRB using the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5) at a high spatial resolution of 0.05° (∼5 km) and without any parameter calibration. Simulations conducted using different precipitation datasets are compared to investigate the discrepancies in streamflow, terrestrial water storage (TWS), soil moisture, and evapotranspiration (ET) caused by precipitation uncertainty. Results indicate that precipitation is a key determinant of simulated streamflow in the MRB; peak flow and soil moisture are particularly sensitive to precipitation input. Further, precipitation data with a higher spatial resolution did not improve the simulations, contrary to the common perception that using meteorological forcing with higher spatial resolution would improve hydrological simulations. In addition, since high flow indicators are particularly influenced by precipitation data, the choice of precipitation data could directly impact flood pulse simulations in the MRB. Notable differences are also found among TWS, soil moisture, and ET simulated using different precipitation products. Moreover, TWS, soil moisture, and ET exhibit a varying degree of sensitivity to precipitation uncertainty. This study provides crucial insights on precipitation‐induced uncertainties in process‐based hydrological modeling and uncovers these uncertainties in the MRB.",

      "abstract": "This study evaluates the uncertainty of four components of the hydroclimatic modelling chain on flood projections over 96 basins covering contrasting hydrometeorological regimes located in Canada and Mexico. Two ensembles of climate simulations are considered, a large ensemble of 22 global climate model simulations and a smaller ensemble of three high-resolution regional climate model simulations. The other components are two post-processing techniques, three lumped hydrological models and six probability distributions. These four sources are assessed through a method of variance decomposition applied to six flood indicators over a reference period and two future periods: 1976–2005, 2041–2070 and 2070–2099. Systematic differences are observed between basins with contrasting flood-generating processes. Snow-dominated basins consistently show larger variance contributions from hydrological models, while rain-dominated basins show climate simulations as their dominant source. These results underline the need to consider the variability of each component’s uncertainty contribution and its link to hydroclimatic conditions and dominant processes.",

      "abstract": "Urban flood frequencies have increased and will continuously increase due to global climate change and rapid urbanization, causing enormous economic problems and social impact. Resistant strategies are no longer the best option for disaster mitigation. Improving cities' resilience to external disruptions is becoming a more important method for mitigating the impact of urban flooding. However, there are relatively little research has been conducted on the resilience of urban flood control systems. The introduction of the concept of resilience can provide a new way of thinking for urban flood control research, which can help to understand the coping process of the system during heavy rainfall, emphasizing the absorption, resistance, and recovery stages to improve the system's adaptability to the changing environment and effectively alleviate the pressure of urban flooding. This study discusses the impact of the design and configuration of urban flood control programs on the resilience of the system under heavy rainfall. Moreover, the resilience benefit is presented to quantify the phased process of system resilience capacity for measuring the quantitative relationship between programs and system resilience. Finally, the unit annual average cost of the program is combined with the resilience benefit to make decisions and ensure that cities are effectively reducing the risk of urban flooding with the optimal alternatives. The proposed framework was applied to Zhangjiagang City, a highly urbanized and densely populated city in China. The results showed that (1) during the same rainfall event, the hydrological indicators characterizing the system’s resilience process (absorption, resistance, and recovery) have distinct weights; (2) rainfall has an effect on the index weight, and the weight fluctuates when the system responds to rainfall in distinct return periods; (3) rainfall return periods can have an impact on a program’s effectiveness in improving the system's resilience at various stages, and the extent to which different programs are affected by the return period varies; and (4) combining large-scale and micro-scale programs improve the resilience of the system more effectively, whereas concentrating on expanding storage volume without raising the water surface rate improves the resilience of the system less effective. This framework can be used to assess the improvements in resilience acquired from various urban flood control program configurations and to assist city planners in selecting the optimal configuration, so assisting in the decision-making process for urban planning and disaster mitigation.",

Finally, the WRASTIC index was provided as seven informational layers and the index number for each sub-basin was calculated by weighting, ranking, and integrating the layers. The results showed that three sub-basins have a high risk and three others have a medium risk. According to the level of risk, this catchment is exposed to pollution and has vulnerability mainly due to human activities including a high volume of sewage discharged into the catchment, a high amount of agricultural and entertainment activities in the region, transport pathways and railways, as well as the vastness of the catchment. Therefore, supervising and controlling human activities in the catchment is necessary to improve the ecological conditions of water resources in the area.",

      "abstract": "Multivariate statistical techniques are powerful in data interpretation and pattern recognition, which play a vital role in pollutant source identification for water environment management. Despite of their wide application in hydro-chemical analysis, absence of a comprehensive workflow hinders the practices and further studies. The present study constructed a workflow on the application of multivariate statistical techniques in spatio-seasonal hydro-chemical analysis, which provided a basic guidance for practices and a systematic support to future exploration. Selection of the methods and work paths for spatio-seasonal analysis largely depends on the structure of data set and the requirements of specific tasks. Trial and adjustment could be repeatedly performed to optimize the analysis strategy and identify more underlying patterns. Given a multiscale dataset concerning complex spatio-seasonal variations, temporal or spatial grouping using appropriate methods to reasonably divide the complicated data set contributes to data interpretation and pattern recognition. The upper Yangtze River basin (UYRB, China) was employed for case analysis to demonstrate how the workflow guides an efficient and effective data exploration. Efforts could be made in future works to continually improve the workflow to involve more complicated analysis and techniques and the integrated application in various fields.",

      "abstract": "In Brazil, specifically in the Doce River basin, there is still a great lack of studies on temporal and spatial trends in water quality, since the water quality in the monitoring campaigns is basically evaluated when it comes down to the concentrations of monitored variables. In this sense, the objective of this work was to perform a temporal and spatial trend analysis of water quality data in the Minas Gerais portion of the Doce River basin, Brazil. For this, the Mann–Kendall, seasonal Mann–Kendall and Spearman correlation tests were used in the temporal analysis and the cluster analysis in the spatial analysis. In the analysis of temporal trends, the analyses were performed using the values of the National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NSFWQI) and the variables that compose it. In the analysis of spatial trends, the stations were evaluated only based on the WQI. With the results of the analysis of temporal trend, it was identified that most stations did not present a statistically significant trend for the WQI. In the stations that presented trends of quality reduction, most of them are in densely populated areas, demonstrating the strong influence of the poor sanitary conditions of the municipalities to the water quality of the basin. When analyzing the variables that compose the WQI, the results found for nitrate demonstrated that water quality deterioration is also affected by the diffuse pollution originating from farming areas. The results for Escherichia coli reinforced the impact of the discharge of domestic effluents and demonstrated the absence of a significative trend is still of concern because it can represent the maintenance of a degradation state in the water bodies. In the spatial trend analysis, the CA grouped the monitoring stations into six clusters based on their similarity among the WQI values, and, together with the results of the other analyses, it was verified that the Caratinga River basin (UGRH5 Caratinga) presented the highest degree of pollution. It was also possible to identify five stations that can be reallocated or deactivated since they have similarities with other stations located in the same watercourse.",

      "abstract": "The ecological sustainability of rivers is in question due to severe pollution and lack of stringent regulations. Long term (1990–2016) water quality data of five stations namely Haridwar, Bareilly, Kanpur, Prayagraj and Varanasi of Upper Ganga river, India was considered for analysis using fuzzy analytical process (FAHP) based water quality index (WQI) to assess surface water quality. The value of water physical, biological and chemical parameters of temporal resolution (monthly, seasonal and yearly) indicate that value of electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total alkalinity (Mg CaCO 3 ), total hardness (Mg CaCO 3 ), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), chlorine (Cl) and bicarbonate (HCO 3 ) were observed very high compared to recommended value of Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and World Health Organization (WHO) at Kanpur, Prayagraj and Varanasi stations. However, low value of parameters is observed at Haridwar and Bareilly stations. Also, the high deviation was observed in water quality parameters during 1990–2010 whereas the deviation of parameters is decreased in 2011–2016. It is observed from the piper diagram that magnesium and bicarbonate at Haridwar, sodium, potassium and bicarbonate in Bareilly, Kanpur, Prayagraj and Varanasi stations are dominant during monthly and seasonal periods. The fuzzy based WQI value indicate that water quality is excellent to poor at Haridwar, while poor to unsuitable in Bareilly, Kanpur, Prayagraj and Varanasi during monthly and seasonal periods. The water quality ranges from poor to unsuitable during the 1990–2010 period and good to very poor during the 2011–2016 period at Bareilly, Kanpur, Prayagraj and Varanasi stations. Whereas very good to good during 1990–2010 and excellent to good during 2011–2016 at Haridwar. It was also determined that water quality parameters (Ca, Na+K, SO 4 , Hardness, Cl and Mg) and WQI values were increased with length of the stream. It indicates that drain discharge, urban growth, urban functions, ecological footprints and crop area increment were key sources of pollution.",

      "abstract": "Water environmental capacity (WEC), the maximum amount of contaminants that a water body system can take without unacceptable impact to water quality in the system, is an important index for the managements of water resources and environmental quality. Here we proposed a machine learning-assisted approach that can be used to estimate watershed-scale WEC. In the approach, a process-based model was used to simulate contaminant concentrations at monitoring or critical river locations in response to contaminant inputs in the watershed, while an artificial neural network (ANN) as a machine learning method was trained to link the contaminant inputs in the watershed with the contaminant concentrations at the critical locations. From the linkages, a watershed-scale WEC that meets water quality constraints was obtained using a global optimization method. The integration of ANN in the WEC estimation is computationally efficient that can avoid exhaustive search of WEC using the process-based model only, especially in a complex river network system. Maozhou River watershed located at Shenzhen City, Southeast China, was used as an example to illustrate the approach with ammonium as an example contaminant. The obtained optimal WEC value varied with different water quality constraints and input distributions. The approach can be used to estimate WEC in the watershed with and without pre-existence contaminant inputs by optimizing the design of new inputs and their distribution. The results had an important implication for future watershed-scale water environmental management.",

      "citations": 54,
      "abstract": "River ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate change and projected future increase in air temperature is expected to increase the stress for these ecosystems. Rivers are also an important socio-economic factor impacting, amongst others, agriculture, tourism, electricity production, and drinking water supply and quality. In addition to changes in water availability, climate change will impact river temperature. This study presents a detailed analysis of river temperature and discharge evolution over the 21st century in Switzerland. In total, 12 catchments are studied, situated both on the lowland Swiss Plateau and in the Alpine regions. The impact of climate change is assessed using a chain of physics-based models forced with the most recent climate change scenarios for Switzerland including low-, mid-, and high-emission pathways. The suitability of such models is discussed in detail and recommendations for future improvements are provided. The model chain is shown to provide robust results, while remaining limitations are identified. These are mechanisms missing in the model to correctly simulate water temperature in Alpine catchments during the summer season. A clear warming of river water is modelled during the 21st century. At the end of the century (2080–2090), the median annual river temperature increase ranges between C for low-emission and C for high-emission scenarios for both lowland and Alpine catchments. At the seasonal scale, the warming on the lowland and in the Alpine regions exhibits different patterns. For the lowland the summer warming is stronger than the one in winter but is still moderate. In Alpine catchments, only a very limited warming is expected in winter. The period of maximum discharge in Alpine catchments, currently occurring during mid-summer, will shift to earlier in the year by a few weeks (low emission) or almost 2 months (high emission) by the end of the century. In addition, a noticeable soil warming is expected in Alpine regions due to glacier and snow cover decrease.

      "abstract": "Recently, a stochastic data-driven framework was introduced for forecasting uncertain multiscale hydrological and water resources processes (e.g., streamflow, urban water demand (UWD)) that uses wavelet decomposition of input data to address multiscale change and stochastics to account for input variable selection, parameter, and model output uncertainty (Quilty et al., 2019). The former study considered all sources of uncertainty together. In contrast, this study explores how input variable selection uncertainty and wavelet decomposition impact probabilistic forecasting performance by considering eight variations of this framework that either include/ignore wavelet decomposition and varying levels of uncertainty: 1) none; 2) parameter; 3) parameter and model output; and 4) input variable selection, parameter, and model output. For a daily UWD forecasting case study in Montreal (Canada), substantial improvements in forecasting performance (e.g., 16–30% improvement in the mean interval score) was achieved when input variable selection uncertainty and wavelet decomposition were included within the framework.",

      "abstract": "Accurate and reliable predictions of estuarine salinity can lead to more effective water resource management and can alleviate the adverse impacts of saltwater intrusion. Due to the nonlinear and nonstationary features in time series of estuarine salinity, this study is conducted to develop a hybrid model coupling the techniques of wavelet transform (WT) and artificial neural network (ANN) for forecasting estuarine salinity in the Pearl River Estuary, China. Two wavelet-based forecasting frameworks, the direct forecast (DF) framework (i.e., only explanatory variables are decomposed, leading to direct forecasting of the target variables) and multicomponent forecast (MF) framework (i.e., both explanatory and target variables are decomposed, and each target component is forecasted separately), were used to construct the WT-ANN models. The results reveal the superiority of hybrid WT-ANN models in estuarine salinity forecasting over traditional multiple linear regression (MLR) models and single ANN models, indicated by the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE). Between the two wavelet-based forecasting paradigms, the MF framework outperformed the DF framework for better capturing the mutual dependence (i.e., mutual information, MI) between input and output variables. Additionally, the superiority of WT-ANN models in comparison with MLR and ANN models is increasingly prominent when the forecast lead time is extended from 1 to 3 days.",

      "abstract": "This study evaluates the relationship between flow variability of unregulated and regulated streamflow stations and global climate indicators. Mann–Kendall and change-point analysis is applied to investigate the gradual and abrupt changes in streamflow data, followed by the investigation of multi-scale fluctuations in streamflow data using Continuous Wavelet Analysis. Linkages between streamflow and global climate indicators are examined using Cross-Wavelet and Wavelet Coherence Analysis. Results showed contrasting trend values for unregulated and regulated streamflow stations. Surprisingly, all unregulated stations experienced a significant abrupt shift in change point contrary to the regulated streamflow. Further, for unregulated stations, streamflow variability and hydroclimatic teleconnections were observed at a lower scale, indicating that variations in streamflow are more frequent and generally occur on an intra-annual to inter-annual scale. Contrary to this, regulated stations observed the streamflow variability and hydroclimatic teleconnections at a larger scale (8–10 years), indicating that all the fluctuations are smoothed out. Thus, unregulated stations cannot be used as a proxy for regulated stations in any given basin. Indeed, for better water resource planning and management, both regulated and unregulated streamflow should be investigated.",

      "abstract": "Extreme events, such as droughts, are influenced by climate variability modes such as El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Atlantic Multi‐decadal oscillation (AMO) and Equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation (EQUINOO). Due to the significant interdependency among the climatic indices at various frequencies, a time‐frequency framework is necessary to better understand the teleconnection. The present study evaluates the association between climate variability modes and drought index in India using different variants of wavelet analysis such as wavelet coherence analysis (WCA), partial wavelet coherence analysis (PWCA), multiple wavelet coherence analysis (MWCA) and wavelet reconstruction methods. In this study, four major climatic indices (ENSO, PDO, AMO, EQUINOO) and the drought index, standard precipitation index (SPI), at four different monthly time periods (1, 3, 6 and 12) are considered. The results from the WCA analysis highlight significant teleconnection spectra for ENSO, PDO and EQUINOO at 2–8, 8–16 and 16–32 year time‐frequency bands. Further, PWCA results reveal significant interdependency in the teleconnection of ENSO and PDO at all the scales, while ENSO and EQUINOO are found to be independent modes of interannual drought variability in India. Finally, MWCA results show that the combination of EQUINOO and ENSO better explains the interannual variability of droughts in Northwest and Central northeast India. The results of this study will help improve drought prediction and early warning systems in India, by selection of appropriate climatic oscillations for different regions in India.",

      "abstract": "This study characterizes wet and dry conditions in southern South America, defined through the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), considering short and long timescales. Prior to analysis, a regionalization was conducted considering the area’s diverse climatological regimes, employing a combination of the k-means clustering algorithm and principal component analysis. Dry and wet events were analyzed over six homogeneous regions, defined as wet or dry conditions with time and spatial coherence. Generally, smaller events ( 50% of a region) occurred less frequently and varied in size over time. Event intensity varied, with no prolonged preference for a specific intensity. Certain regions, notably southern Bolivia and northwestern Argentina showed a discernible tendency towards drier conditions over time, with wet events becoming more intense despite reduced coverage. The events defined with shorter SPEI timescales showed similar behavior to those defined with longer SPEI timescales but with higher month-to-month variability and less spatial coherence. A wavelet analysis revealed punctual, significant periods on the interannual timescale and more persistent ones on the interdecadal and decadal timescales. Mechanisms associated with event behavior were analyzed. Characterizing events in terms of their intensity, duration, and spatial extent revealed that moderate events were predominantly short (< 3 months) while longer and more extended events were often severe. Events calculated with shorter SPEI timescales showed smaller durations than those calculated with longer SPEI timescales. In addition, wet events showed a similar proportion of moderate and severe cases, while dry events were predominantly moderate.",

      "abstract": "Flood emergency management practices cover various aspects of flooding, such as demography, infrastructure, economy, transportation, and agriculture. Emergency managers and local authorities work to understand existing and potential impacts of flooding in their communities. HAZUS is one of the most widely used GIS-based desktop software packages designed to help emergency managers to simulate floods and observe their possible effects in their communities. Using HAZUS, emergency managers can prioritize regions to receive help, allocate resources, and plan mitigation measures in the disaster area. However, the system has limitations in terms of its technical requirements, the number of flood scenarios and data options, accessibility, and performance. In this study, we present an integrated and scalable web framework for HAZUS-MH flood loss estimation analysis. By taking advantage of the Iowa Flood Center’s extensive flood inundation map repository for Iowa, we could enable interactive analysis between flood map raster and census data to demonstrate flooding impacts in Iowa communities. High-resolution pre-computed flood inundation maps allowed us to execute damage and loss analyses within seconds. Using visualization techniques on the web, users can access damage and loss analysis without specific software or technical expertise. Moreover, by connecting new data sources, we also enabled many different analyses through the web-based system, including agricultural damage and loss analysis and flooded transportation segments. The generalized architecture of the system allows the framework to analyze any region and community.",

      "citations": 17,
      "abstract": "The present study describes the development of a web-based flood risk information system ‘WebFRIS’ for Jagatsinghpur district, a severely flood-prone region in Eastern India. The WebFRIS is designed by using various readily available open-source web tools and packages such as Google Map, PHP, MySQL, and JSON. Special emphasis is directed towards designing the layout and architecture, to be easily accessible by any end-user irrespective of any technical know-how. The WebFRIS illustrates spatial maps of flood hazard, socio-economic vulnerability, and flood risk at the village level for two-time scenarios. While analyzing a set of graphical statistics depicting the changes in flood risk components, a significant increase in high and very-high categories of both flood hazard (~140%) and socio-economically vulnerable villages (~68%) is noticed during Scenario-I. The number of villages facing compound risk (contributed equally by flood hazard and socio-economic vulnerability) nearly doubled in Scenario-I. A spatial analysis of diametric changes in flood risk shows that a large proportion of villages in Balikuda, Ersama, and Tirtol tehsils have undergone radical changes. Following these observations, a set of possible engineering, social, and policy measures are proposed, whose implementation in the near future is expected to reinforce flood management in the study area. The WebFRIS architecture is flexible, easy-to-use; it is expected to provide crucial lessons to the local bodies, town-planners, water professionals, flood experts, and also the citizens, a precious knowledge on flood risk management. The WebFRIS may be considered as a precious cartographic product for environmental management. The proposed web platform is generic, as it can be applied to study other inter-related systems such as environmental protection, land-use planning, coastal habitat restoration, and community resilience building.

However, GRIB datasets are complex and do not constitute analysis-ready data without additional preprocessing.

      "abstract": "In light of the dramatic increase in economic impacts due to wildfires over recent years, the need for globally consistent impact modelling of wildfire damages is ever increasing. Insurance companies, individual households, humanitarian organizations, governmental authorities, and investors and portfolio owners are increasingly required to account for climate-related physical risks. In response to these societal challenges, we present an extension to the open-source and open-access risk modelling platform CLIMADA (CLImate ADAptation) for modelling economic impacts of wildfires in a globally consistent and spatially explicit approach. All input data are free, public and globally available, ensuring applicability in data-scarce regions of the Global South. The model was calibrated at resolutions of 1, 4 and 10 km using information on past wildfire damage reported by the disaster database EM-DAT. Despite the large remaining uncertainties, the model yields sound damage estimates with a model performance well in line with the results of other natural catastrophe impact models, such as for tropical cyclones. To complement the global perspective of this study, we conducted two case studies on the recent megafires in Chile (2017) and Australia (2020). The model is made available online as part of a Python package, ready for application in practical contexts such as disaster risk assessment, near-real-time impact estimates or physical climate risk disclosure.",

      "citations": 18,
      "abstract": "Fire activity in the Peruvian Andes has increased significantly in recent decades, but climatic parameters associated with drought, which may indirectly contribute to the occurrence of severe forest fires, have not yet been investigated. Because fire prevention tools are scarce, strategies for deterring burning are necessary in order to reduce impacts in regions where forest fires usually result from human activity. This study explores the conditions conducive to forest fire in the Andes of Peru. Daily precipitation and temperature observed data from the PISCO gridded dataset for the 2002-2016 period were used. In addition, MODIS satellite images (MOD09A1 product) were collected to characterise Andean vegetation using spectral indices. Analysis of daily temperature and rainfall indicates that climatic parameters such as cumulative precipitation, dry-day frequency and hot-day frequency are statistically associated with conditions that could contribute to increased forest fire occurrence. Our findings suggest that a decrease in the water content of vegetation, estimated by the Global Vegetation Moisture Index during the dry period and wet period onset, can be used to identify potential conditions for forest fire occurrence. This study suggests that forest managers should consider implementing prevention strategies that include continuous monitoring of climate and vegetation parameters.",

      "citations": 2,
      "abstract": "Evidence is mounting that the effectiveness of using prescribed burns as a management tactic may be diminishing due to the higher incidence of wildfire re-burns. The development of predictive models of re-burns is thus essential to better understand their primary drivers so that forest management practices can be updated to account for these events. First, we assess the potential for human activity as a driver of re-burns by evaluating re-burn trends both within and outside of the wildland–urban interface (WUI) of the western US. Next, we investigate the predictability of re-burns through the application of both random forest and the explanatory machine learning non-negative matrix factorization using k-means clustering (NMFk) algorithms to predict re-burn occurrence over California based on a number of climate factors. Our findings indicate that while most states showed increasing trends within the WUI when trends were conducted over longer moving windows (eg 20 years), California was the only state where the rate of increase was consistently higher in the WUI, indicating a stronger potential for human activity as a driver in that location. Furthermore, we find model performance was found to be robust over most of California (Testing F1 scores= 0.688), although results were highly variable based on EPA level III Ecoregion (F1 scores= 0.0–0.778). Insights provided from this study will lead to a better understanding of climate and human activity drivers of re-burns and how these vary at broad spatial scales so that improvements in forest management practices can be tuned according to the level of change that is expected for a given region.",

      "citations": 3,
      "abstract": "Wildfire can alter soil-hydraulic properties, often resulting in an increased prevalence of infiltration-excess overland flow and greater potential for debris-flow hazards. Mini disk tension infiltrometers (MDIs) can be used to estimate soil hydraulic properties, such as field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs) and wetting front potential (Hf), and their spatial variability following wildfire. However, the small (point-scale) footprint of MDI measurements makes it challenging to use these data to parameterize hydrologic models at the hillslope and watershed scales where hydrologic hazards, such as debris flows, initiate. Here, we designed numerical experiments to estimate spatially constant or watershed-scale effective hydrologic parameters (EHPs) that approximate the response of spatially variable hydrologic parameters with distributions derived from MDI measurements at five sites in the southwestern United States. We found that it is possible to define EHPs for both Kfs and Hf based on the MDI measurements that lead to reasonable approximations of run-off hydrographs at the outlets of small watersheds (<1 km2). We found that watershed EHPs are functions of rainfall characteristics, although they are most sensitive to rainfall intensity and relatively less sensitive to the temporal distribution of rainfall. EHPs are lower than the arithmetic mean of the MDI measurements and are better approximated by the median or geometric mean of the MDI measurements, particularly for storms with recurrence intervals of approximately 1 year or less that commonly initiate post-fire debris flows. This work demonstrated that using the proposed upscaling method to estimate watershed-scale EHPs, as opposed to approximating EHPs based on the arithmetic mean of the MDI measurements, improved the ability of a hydrologic model to identify storms that are likely to produce debris flows. Results improved our ability to link point-scale MDI measurements and watershed-scale EHPs in post-fire settings and helped guide our ability to use MDI data to parameterize post-fire hydrologic models.",

REMAINS enables the simulation of fire-landscape dynamics under different land-use and fire management scenarios. The package incorporates the spatial interaction of fire-related processes including fire ignition, spread and extinction, as well as vegetation dynamics such as including natural succession and post-fire regeneration. With a comprehensive set of functions, REMAINS allows for the simulation of two fire-suppression strategies, prescribed fire approaches, and land-use policy scenarios. Furthermore, REMAINS facilitates the assessment of the impacts of such management options on fire regime attributes.

      "journal": "Natural Hazards",
      "citations": 3,
      "abstract": "Wildfire ignition models can help in identifying risk factors and mapping high-risk areas, which addresses an urgent issue as wildfires become increasingly destructive. Despite advancements in data collection and data analysis, challenges persist as ignitions depend on numerous interconnected factors at a fine spatial resolution. Predicting wildfire ignitions from data is an imbalanced classification problem, given the vast number of non-ignition data compared to ignition data. To address this issue, this study proposes an ensemble-based model for binary classification of wildfire ignitions. The data are collected for a 24,867 km 2 area in northern California from January 2014 to May 2022 and includes 76 predictors covering topographic, land cover, anthropogenic, and climatic data. Different base classifiers are evaluated and the random forest is found the most performant, yielding a recall of 0.67 and a specificity of 0.87. Feature importance analysis shows that the Topographic Wetness Index is the most important climatic predictor, while population density and land cover development are also highly rated. Comparison of yearly average of computed daily probabilities with ignition data shows that the model accurately captures the spatial pattern of ignitions, which can reveal high-risk areas. The model is then used to assess how climatic and anthropogenic factors impact wildfire ignition frequency. The projected scenarios show that the number and spread of ignitions would significantly increase with an increase in population in sparsely populated areas, while climatic factors have secondary effects in isolation but in combination may compound the risk.

      "abstract": "Globally, wildfires burn an average of approximately 5.5 Mha of forest per year. Deriving a detailed inventory of forest fuel conditions is critical to managing resources both before and during a fire. However, data products that form the basis of these inventories often come from disparate sources, may not be subject to update, or may not capture information relevant to fuels and fire behaviour. Satellite-derived data products present a valuable solution to these concerns due to exhaustive spatial coverage and capacity for frequent temporal revisit. In this study, we modeled annual burn probability in Canadian forests for a 27-year period (1994–2020) using satellite-derived data products informing on topographic, biotic, and climatic variables. While not predicting the presence or absence of a wildfire, a high burn probability as output from the models showed strong correspondence with actual burned areas. Results indicated that biotic variables representing canopy cover and stand volume were among the most important to estimate burn probability, with the most relevant climatic variables being spring precipitation and the annual range of temperature. Analysis of the temporal trends in burn probability highlighted that 15% of tiles analyzed had significantly declining trends in mean burn probability across the study period. These decreasing trends did not always correspond to reductions in total burned area, potentially indicating a shift in forest composition of some regions and a change in the conditions which burn in others. This study highlights the importance and potential of annual burn probability mapping in order to capture these longer-term trends as well as changes in climatic conditions, which are more dynamic than other biotic or topographic drivers of burn probability. This study demonstrates the use of freely available satellite-derived datasets to generate maps of burn probability across a large, structurally and compositionally diverse forested extent, aimed to inform effective fire management.",

      "journal": "Water",

      "abstract": "The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Hydro model as a physical-based, fully-distributed, multi-parameterization modeling system easy to couple with numerical weather prediction model, has potential for operational flood forecasting in the small and medium catchments (SMCs). However, this model requires many input forcings, which makes it difficult to use it for the SMCs without adequate observed forcings. The Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), the WRF outputs and the ideal forcings generated by the WRF-Hydro model can provide all forcings required in the model for these SMCs. In this study, seven forcing scenarios were designed based on the products of GLDAS, WRF and ideal forcings, as well as the observed and merged rainfalls to assess the performance of the WRF-Hydro model for flood simulation. The model was applied to the Chenhe catchment, a typical SMC located in the Midwestern China. The flood prediction capability of the WRF-Hydro model was also compared to that of widely used Xinanjiang model. The results show that the three forcing scenarios, including the GLDAS forcings with observed rainfall, the WRF forcings with observed rainfall and GLDAS forcings with GLDAS-merged rainfall, are optimal input forcings for the WRF-Hydro model. Their mean root mean square errors (RMSE) are 0.18, 0.18 and 0.17 mm/h, respectively. The performance of the WRF-Hydro model driven by these three scenarios is generally comparable to that of the Xinanjiang model (RMSE = 0.17 mm/h).",
