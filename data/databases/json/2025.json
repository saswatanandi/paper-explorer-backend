      "abstract": "While the influence of compound extreme events is gaining attention with advancing extreme climate research, the variations in their impacts on regional crop production require further exploration. Here, we primarily analyze the changes in compound hot-dry events and compound hot-wet events in China from 1985 to 2019, based on meteorological observations from 686 stations. Then, their contributions to losses in cropland net primary productivity (CNPP) are identified using the extreme gradient boosting and Shapley additive explanations models. Results indicate that compound extreme events have become increasingly frequent, persistent, and severe over the past 35 years. With the increasing risks of compound extreme events, greater CNPP losses are observed in the northern regions compared to the southern regions. Throughout the growing season, CNPP losses caused by compound extreme events initially increase, peak in summer, and then gradually decrease. CNPP losses in China are primarily influenced by compound hot-dry events. From north to south, the events dominating CNPP losses shift sequentially from compound daytime hot and dry events to compound day-night hot and dry events, and finally to compound nighttime hot and dry events. This study explores the threats posed by compound extreme events to regional crop production and provides new insights into extreme climate risks in China, supporting climate-adaptive agricultural development.",

      "abstract": "Atmospheric moisture plays a crucial role in connecting global water and energy exchanges within the water cycle. Using a water recycling model, this study examines the spatiotemporal characteristics of precipitation and evaporation recycling ratios (PRR and ERR) across 200 river basins worldwide from 1980 to 2021, with data fused from three reanalysis datasets. The results reveal that regions near the equator exhibit higher PRR values, signifying strong moisture selfsufficiency, whereas arid, high-latitude, and inland regions show lower PRR values, indicating a higher dependence on external water vapor. Temporal trends indicate a decline in PRR and ERR in regions such as North America, South Africa, and Australia, while some areas in Central Asia and Europe have experienced increases. Structural Equation Modeling reveals that land cover, especially the Leaf Area Index (LAI), and wind speed are key drivers of spatial and temporal variability in water recycling ratios. The study classifies river basins into four categories based on their water recycling trends:‘Enhanced Exchange Basins,’‘Beneficial Basins,’‘Shrinkage Basins,’and ‘Reduced Exchange Basins.’These classifications provide valuable insights into regional water cycles and can inform targeted water resource management strategies, crucial for addressing challenges like water scarcity and ecosystem restoration.",

      "abstract": "Much of the world’s population faces significant threats to water security that are likely to be exacerbated under a warmer climate. To understand the impact of climate change on water security, we characterise the relationship between total annual streamflow, a surrogate for water supply, and low frequency flood events. We first calculate the proportion of annual streamflow attributable to flood events at approximately 5000 stations globally, then characterise this relationship as a function of climate and catchment characteristics. To explore the impact of climate changes we investigate trends in these relationships. We find that across the world on average 25% of annual streamflow comes from a single flood event and this proportion is well described by the variability in streamflow and precipitation, which is a function of catchment aridity. In arid to semi-arid catchments, where on average over 40% of annual streamflow comes from a single flood event, we conclude that water availability may be reasonably approximated by focusing on a selection of low frequency events, simplifying the projection of water supply changes under a future climate. Flood generating mechanism is crucial in determining trends of annual streamflow volumes from low frequency events. Where snowmelt is a significant flood process, increasing temperatures are causing a reduction in the proportion of total annual streamflows accounted for by flood events. Where snow is not a significant flood driver, trends are dominated by hydroclimatic variability and aridity, which is expected to be exacerbated with a shift to rainfall driven flooding under climate change.",

      "abstract": "Soil erosion status is a comprehensive indicator reflecting the quality and stability of ecosystems. Soil erosion changes in China are becoming more unclear due to climate change and intensified human activity. Within the framework of climate change, this study treats the rainfall erosion factor as a dynamic factor and examines three types of contrasting precipitation-general, heavy, and extreme-through integrates the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation and Geographic Information Systems to reveal differences in water erosion driven by varying intensities of precipitation. The results reveal that over 63% of China's land area has experienced soil erosion during the historical period (1980-2022), with slight erosion being the most common. Severe water erosion is predominantly found in the Southwest Basin, the Yangtze River Basin, and the Yellow River basin. The multi-year average soil erosion rate in China is estimated at 2.46 t·ha −1 yr −1 , with R95P and R99P contributing 26.50% and 7.71%, respectively. Future projections (2023-2100) indicate that soil erosion driven by PRCPTOT, R95P, and R99P could increase by 22%-91% under SSP5-RCP8.5 and SSP2-RCP4.5 scenarios. Overall, climate change has a limited effect on the spatial pattern of soil erosion in China, mainly influencing the intensity and extent of water erosion and adversely impacting most regions. Extreme precipitation is more sensitive to climate change, making future erosion risks associated with it a critical concern. These findings can guide decision-makers and resource managers in regional planning to enhance resilience to climate change and secure water and food resources.",

      "abstract": "Central Asia (CA) is a critical agricultural region, contributing significantly to global food and cotton production, yet it faces increasing threats from extreme heatwaves (HWs) due to global warming. Despite this, the specific impacts of historical and future HWs on CA's cropland remain underexplored. Here, using five bias-corrected global circulation models from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3b (ISIMIP3b), we present a detailed analysis of CA's cropland exposure to HWs from historical periods (1995-2014) and under three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP126, SSP370, and SSP585) for 2021-2100. Compared to historical levels, we find that exposure to heatwave frequency could increase by 199% by 2081-2100 under SSP126, while exposure to heatwave duration could rise by as much as 852% and 1143% under SSP370 and SSP585, respectively. Northern Kazakhstan emerges as particularly vulnerable, with the highest exposure levels across scenarios. Interactive effects between climate shifts and land-use changes are the dominant contributors, accounting for over 50% of total exposure in each scenario. These findings highlight CA's vulnerability to HWs under various climate pathways, emphasizing the urgency of targeted adaptation strategies to protect regional agricultural resilience and, by extension, global food security.",

      "abstract": "Flash droughts are rapidly intensifying drought events that can have severe impacts on both natural and human systems. This study assesses the vulnerability and resilience of different land use and land cover (LULC) types to flash droughts in the Mississippi River Basin (MRB) from 2000 to 2022. Using the Standardized Antecedent Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SAPEI) to identify flash drought events and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) data to define recovery periods, 315 unique flash drought events were identified, with the top ten most severe events analyzed in detail. The identification of flash drought events was done using a spatiotemporal method that combines spatial tracking of contiguous drought areas with rapid intensification criteria. The study found significant variability in recovery times across the MRB, with durations ranging from 8 to 120 days. Regions that experienced the most severe drought conditions, particularly during the 2006, 2012, and 2022 flash drought events, exhibited the longest recovery periods, indicating prolonged ecological stress. Forested areas demonstrated higher resilience, with shorter recovery times, while agricultural lands, particularly those reliant on rain-fed crops, showed the longest recovery periods, highlighting their vulnerability to rapid moisture loss. The Missouri River Basin and Upper MRB, characterized by lower annual precipitation and higher potential evapotranspiration, often exhibited the longest recovery durations due to their extensive agricultural activities. These findings underscore the importance of targeted drought management strategies, including the implementation of more robust water management practices and the adoption of drought-resistant crops, to mitigate the impacts of flash droughts and enhance the resilience of vulnerable regions in the MRB.",

      "abstract": "Whether the previous vegetation greening trend in China has persisted into the recent warmest decade and how the exceptional climate conditions of 2023 affected long-term change in vegetation greenness remain unexplored. Here we integrated two decades of remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index data with climate records to reveal a persistent greening (referring to the increasing trend of vegetation greenness) of China, occurring at a rate triple the global average, while the greening signal varies geographically. A prominent greening trend is primarily driven by the greening of humid and subhumid regions, consistent with the expected effects of rising CO 2 on vegetation growth and intensified human practices including agricultural intensification and ambitious afforestation programs. By contrast, semi-arid and arid ecosystems showed non-significant greenness change due to drastic warming and precipitation fluctuations. The exceptional warming and precipitation reduction in 2023 did not trigger a record-high decrease in vegetation greenness when integrated across China. The vegetation greenness in 2023 instead reached the third highest on record which is contributed by enhancement in North China, Northeast China, and the Tibetan Plateau. Climatic extremes in 2023 induced significant browning in the Loess Plateau, Inner Mongolia, and Southwest China. While ecosystems especially in the southern China demonstrated relatively high resilience to climatic extreme events like high-temperature extremes and droughts, autumn greenness in 2023 can recover to levels even higher than the 2020-2022 average, despite significant browning in spring and summer. We, therefore, suggested that the 2023 climate extremes would not produce a new baseline from which vegetation growth will transition towards a state of degradation at both regional and national scales.",

      "abstract": "Remarkable vegetation greening has been observed in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) during the past two decades, triggering noteworthy hydrological consequences. Previous studies have assessed the hydrological effect of vegetation greening but ignored the vegetation-precipitation feedbacks from land-atmosphere interactions. To address this knowledge gap, here we conduct coupled land-atmosphere model simulations prescribed with satellite vegetation observations to investigate how vegetation greening in the YRB affects regional hydrological cycles through vegetation physiological processes and biophysical feedbacks, with potentially competing effects on water yield (WY) by altering evapotranspiration (ET) and precipitation. Over the 2001-2020 period, the leaf area index in summer shows a significant increasing trend at a rate of 0.34 m 2 m −2 decade −1 ( P < 0.01). This vegetation greening causes a substantial rise in ET, primarily due to increased plant transpiration and canopy evaporation, along with reduced soil evaporation attributed to enhanced root water uptake and shading of the soil surface. Moreover, the modeled results indicate that vegetation greening is the key driver for the observed ET enhancement. In addition, vegetation greening induces increases in precipitation by modulating moisture flux convergence, which although statistically insignificant, provides considerable water to compensate for the enhanced ET. For the cumulative effects of vegetation greening from 2001 to 2020 at the basin scale, the increased precipitation (approximately, 101 mm) outpaces the increased water consumption (approximately, 93 mm), resulting in an insignificant effect on WY. Our findings underscore the importance of considering vegetation-precipitation feedbacks in evaluations of the hydrological response to natural or deliberate vegetation changes.",

      "abstract": "Agriculture is a cornerstone of global food production, accounting for a substantial portion of water withdrawals worldwide. As the world’s population grows, so does the demand for water in agriculture, leading to alterations in regional water-energy balances. We present an approach to identify the influence of agriculture on the water-energy balance using empirical data. We explore the departure from the Budyko curve for catchments with agricultural expansion and their associations with changes in the water-energy balance using a causal discovery algorithm. Analyzing data from 1,342 catchments across three Köppen-Geiger climate classes-temperate, snowy, and others-from 1980 to 2014, we show that temperate and snowy catchments, which account for over 90% of stations, exhibit distinct patterns. Cropland percentage (CL%) emerges as the dominant factor, explaining 47 and 37% of the variance in deviations from the Budyko curve in temperate and snowy catchments, respectively. In temperate catchments, CL% shows a strong negative correlation with precipitation-streamflow (P-Q) causal strength (Spearman ), suggesting that cropland exacerbates precipitation-driven deviations. A moderate negative correlation with aridity-streamflow (AR-Q) causal strength ( ) indicates additional influences of cropland through aridity-driven interactions. In snowy catchments, CL% is similarly influential, with a positive correlation with P-Q causal strength ( ). However, the negative correlation with AR-Q causal strength ( ) underscores the role of aridity as a secondary driver. While vegetation and precipitation seasonality also contribute to the deviations, their impacts are comparatively lower. These findings underscore the need for inclusion of agricultural activities in changing water-energy balance to secure future water supplies.",

However, the impact of previous water conditions has not received sufficient attention. Using machine learning and a large amount of global ground observation data, we evaluated the impact of previous water conditions at various time scales on global productivity estimation through paired experiments and residual comparison methods. By incorporating run theory, we investigated the uncertainty introduced by neglecting previous water conditions in estimating ecosystem productivity across various levels of vegetation drought frequency, intensity, duration, and severity. We found that 36.8 % of global net primary productivity (NPP) is predominantly influenced by water conditions over the previous 24 months, a percentage higher than those observed at 6, 12, and 18-month time. Considering previous water conditions, the estimated global productivity was 66.72 Pg C yr −1 (468.98 g C/m 2 yr). Neglecting previous water conditions may lead to an underestimation of global productivity by up to 1.27 Pg ( p < 0.05). Regions experiencing severe, prolonged, and intense drought may have significant NPP estimation biases without considering previous water conditions. This study provides an important step toward understanding the impact of previous water conditions and vegetation drought disasters on the carbon sink function of global terrestrial ecosystems.",

However, differences in ecosystem responses to normal and flash droughts in China remain unclear, particularly in terms of vegetation vulnerability and resilience. Using a three-dimensional clustering method, we identified disparities between these drought types from 1982 to 2022 and found that flash droughts developed 40% faster than normal droughts, but normal droughts caused more severe vegetation damage. With the transition to flash droughts, vegetation sensitivity to droughts has increased. Using Shapley's additive interpretation method, we assessed the role of each environmental factor in vegetation recovery. The results show that in normal droughts, drought characteristics and vegetation sensitivity drive the resilience of vegetation, whereas in flash droughts, temperature and vapor pressure deficit become more significant. These insights provide a deeper understanding of vegetation resilience and drought tolerance under changing climatic conditions.",

The rainfall erosivity factor (R-factor) used in the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) is a key parameter for predicting soil erosion. However, its accurate estimation is difficult owing to the complexities of high-resolution rainfall data and limitations of simplified models. This study addressed these challenges by introducing several key innovations. We developed a precise algorithm for calculating the R-factor using minute-interval rainfall data to effectively capture the necessary temporal resolution for assessing the impacts of extreme rainfall events. This advancement allows for accurate R-factor estimation, thereby overcoming the complexities associated with high-resolution data processing. In addition, we established a comprehensive rainfall erosivity database across South Korea based on 24 years of minute-interval rainfall data. We then derived an optimal regression model for estimating monthly rainfall erosivity from daily precipitation data, achieving high accuracy (R 2 = 0.87) by effectively accounting for extreme rainfall events. These efforts culminated in the development of the Web-based Rainfall Erosivity Calculation (WREC) tool, which integrates a database, a rainfall erosivity calculation algorithm, and a simple estimation model. The user-friendly interface of the WREC tool offers a versatile platform for calculating rainfall erosivity, supporting practical applications, and assessing future climate change impacts. Expanding the WREC tool globally and adapting regression models to local contexts will enhance our ability to manage soil erosion and promote sustainable land and water management practices.",

Such data have been calibrated primarily for urban environments, but their accuracy in the rural domain remains largely unexplored. This study systematically validates global gridded population datasets in rural areas, based on reported human resettlement from 307 large dam construction projects in 35 countries. We find large discrepancies between the examined datasets, and, without exception, significant negative biases of −53%, −65%, −67%, −68%, and −84% for WorldPop, GWP, GRUMP, LandScan, and GHS-POP, respectively. This implies that rural population is, even in the most accurate dataset, underestimated by half compared to reported figures. To ensure equitable access to services and resources for rural communities, past and future applications of the datasets must undergo a critical discussion in light of the identified biases. Improvements in the datasets’ accuracies in rural areas can be attained through strengthened population censuses, alternative population counts, and a more balanced calibration of population models.",

      "abstract": "Exposure assessment is critical for hazard risk management. It is important to investigate the cropland exposure to compound drought and heatwave (CDHW) events because of their severe impacts on agriculture. We quantified the variations in CDHW characteristics (i.e., frequency, duration, and magnitude) and the cropland exposure to CDHW events in Northeast China using 20 CMIP6 climate projections for each of the four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (i.e., SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585). The results indicate that increase in CDHW characteristics leading to an anticipated increase in cropland exposure ranges from 1.6-fold to 5.8-fold (the range describes the differences among SSPs), with the west and northeast of the region poised to experience a more pronounced increase. Notably, controlling the development pathway to SSP126 can reduce the rate of increase in CDHW magnitude and cropland exposure compared to other SSPs. Path analysis demonstrates that cropland exposure is primarily driven by maximum temperature (Tmax). Although precipitation (Pre) increases (0.36-0.75 mm year -1 ), the increase in potential evapotranspiration (PET) due to global warming is higher than that of Pre (0.26-1.07 mm year -1 ) except for SSP126, leading to more drought events. In addition, Tmax rise increases the frequency of extreme temperature events. Therefore, increases in Tmax and ALA together contributed to the increase in exposure, with Tmax being the dominant factor in this process. Our findings emphasize the pivotal role of regulating the development pathway into SSP126 for sustainable agricultural development, and optimize planting distribution and planting heat-tolerant crop varieties are recommended for CDHW adaption.",

Study focus Earlier green-up driven by climate warming can profoundly alter hydrological processes. However, the isolated impact of phenological changes on hydrological dynamics, independent of climatic factors, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we quantified the contributions of earlier green-up to evapotranspiration (ET) and basin streamflow by developing a framework that integrates an NDPI-based phenology model with the RHESSys eco-hydrological model. New hydrological insights for the region Between 2001 and 2020, the start of the growing season (SOS) advanced at rates of 1.02 days/year in HSB and 0.97 days/year in KSB, while changes in the end of the growing season were minimal (0.17 and − 0.12 days/year, respectively). In HSB, each one-day advancement in green-up increased ET by 2.22 mm and reduced streamflow discharge by 2.35 million m3. In contrast, in KSB, a one-day advancement in green-up resulted in a more significant increase in ET (11.22 mm) and a more substantial reduction in streamflow discharge (58.24 million m3). KSB's westward-facing topography facilitates the inflow of warm, humid Atlantic air, contributing to a more humid climate, higher vegetation cover, and an earlier SOS compared to HSB. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating phenological dynamics into eco-hydrological assessments to develop effective climate adaptation strategies for inland mountain basins.",

We found that the projected dynamic predictability of agricultural drought would significantly decrease over 70% of the global land areas in +2 °C and +3 °C worlds, especially over North America, Amazonia, Europe, eastern and southern Asia and Australia. This was primarily attributed to the weakening soil moisture memory, background aridity and weakening land-atmosphere coupling.

This study introduces a novel multi-temporal scale drought identification framework (MTSDIF) that classifies historical agricultural drought events into three types: SD, FD, and Slow-to-Flash Drought (SFD). Based on the MTSDIF, the GLDAS-Noah root zone soil moisture dataset was used to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics, evolution, and driving factors of multi-temporal scale droughts in China. Our study confirms the effectiveness of the proposed MTSDIF in classifying droughts with different onset speeds (SD, FD, and SFD). The results indicate that, from 1980 to 2020, the three types of drought events in China exhibited short-term, medium-term, and long-term periodic oscillations. Before 2000, SD events were the predominant type of agricultural drought in China, but post-2000, the areas affected by FD and SFD have been continuously expanding. Compared to SD, key meteorological elements influencing FD and SFD show anomalies exceeding 0.5 times the standard deviation. In the southeastern regions of China, areas with human-impacted soils, leached soils, and incept soils exhibit a higher response frequency to FD. Sea surface temperature indices, including the interannual El Niño-Southern Oscillation in the Pacific and interdecadal variations such as the +PDO and −AMO, significantly influence the occurrence of FD in the monsoon regions of China ( p < 0.01). Together, the results highlight the necessity of understanding the disparities and consistencies in land-atmosphere-ocean mechanisms behind drought events with varying onset speeds.",

In this context, Europe is no exception. Understanding the aggregated impact of synchronized compound hot and dry events at different locations is a pressing issue, especially when it comes to predicting these extremes. We use concepts and methods derived from network theory to highlight hotspot regions in Europe where these spatially compound extremes are increasing and analyse the atmospheric precursors driving these anomalous conditions. Using ERA5 reanalysis data and focusing on the summer and winter seasons of the period 1941-2020, we construct evolving networks constituted by 51 consecutive blocks, encoding the spatial synchronization structure of compound hot and dry events. Next, we highlight the regional and seasonal differences of compounds occurrences and synchronizations, unraveling the main changes in the graphs structure, identifying hotspot regions and, finally, describing the atmospheric conditions behind compound events. The increase of compounds frequency and spatial synchronizations do not always match: synchronizations increase in Southeastern Europe during winter and in some locations in Finland, north of Poland and the Baltic states in summer, although, in both cases, we do not detect a corresponding trend in compounds occurrences. Moreover, we show that most of the synchronizations evolution can be explained by atmospheric pressure dynamical changes, including NAO and SNAO intensity. This work brings out key aspects concerning the underlying spatio-temporal dynamics of concurrent hot and dry events.",

      "abstract": "Fingerprinting analyses have detected the impact of human activities on annual precipitation extremes. Using simulations of selected climate models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), this study has comprehensively demonstrated human influence on seasonal precipitation extremes of Northern Hemisphere Land (NHL) over different spatial scales from 1950 to 2014. By assessing the impacts of various climatic forcings on the maximum 1-day (Rx1day) and 5-day (Rx5day) precipitation indices, our results show that greenhouse gas (GHG) forcings predominantly drive the increase in observed Rx1day across most of the NHL in all four seasons, with more pronounced effects in fall and winter than in spring and summer. Furthermore, low-risk regions tend to experience greater GHG-induced Rx1day than high-risk regions in all seasons. Anthropogenic aerosol (AER) forcings significantly weaken Rx1day, particularly during winter in regions like India and southern China. Change point analysis reveals a rapid increase in Rx1day under GHG forcings and a slower decrease under AER forcing since the 1980 s. However, the abrupt change in Rx1day under both anthropogenic and natural external (ALL) forcings generally began a decade later, around the 1990 s. Using optimal fingerprinting techniques, we demonstrate for the first time that discernible anthropogenic forcings (ANT) impact at least one season in over 80 % of CMIP6 subregions, with more than 60 % of the contributions being attributable to ANT forcings. The number of subregions with detected ANT forcings is twice as high in winter compared to summer. Although seasonal natural (NAT) forcings are undetectable in one-signal analyses, they are detected in similar regions in both two- and three-signal analyses, suggesting that observed changes should be attributed to both anthropogenic and natural forcings.",

      "abstract": "Climate extremes have garnered considerable attention recently because of their devastating effects on both water resources and vegetation health. The vegetation responses to climate extremes, such as high temperatures (hot events), droughts (dry events) and compound dry and hot events (CDHEs), have been extensively evaluated. However, the risk of vegetation drought considering different severity levels of individual and compound climate extremes is not well assessed. In this study, we employed the meta-Gaussian (MG) model, a multivariate approach, to evaluate the response of vegetation drought [characterized by the Standardized Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (SNDVI)] to dry events, hot events and CDHEs. The study found that the dominant factor of vegetation drought, in the central and northwestern parts of Northwestern China (NWC), was the dry events. Conversely, in the southern NWC, temperature exerted a substantial influence on vegetation drought. Relative to individual dry events (hot events), the conditional probability of vegetation drought under CDHEs had decreased (increased) by approximately 24% (17%). Furthermore, the response of grassland to both individual and compound climate extremes was sensitive, whereas forests demonstrated greater resilience to droughts. These findings help us better understand the influence that various severity levels of climate extremes exert on vegetation dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Climate change influences climate variability, increasing the frequency and severity of droughts. These events may trigger vegetation browning, a key indicator of drought propagation and shifts in resilience. While long-term trends often measure browning, rapid vegetation declines require alternative approaches. This study examines drought-induced vegetation browning, resilience, and propagation in central Chile using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series of normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI), and gross primary productivity (GPP). The Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm identified negative vegetation changes, filtering out non-browning events to reduce uncertainties. Spatial variations in browning were analysed across latitudinal gradients, topographies, and vegetation types, while shifts in temporal autocorrelation served as a proxy for resilience. Results indicated declines in NDVI across 19% of the study area, GPP in 12%, and LAI in 8%. NDVI responded to drought within six months, with productivity losses lagging by 8.7 months. Recovery was slow, averaging 3.6 years, and only 20%-25% of the affected areas recovered. Variations in browning timing and magnitude were driven by topography, vegetation, and latitude. A decline in vegetation resilience highlights the need for strategies to enhance adaptability to climate change.",

      "abstract": "Over the last several decades, droughts driven by climate change have damaged agricultural production as the planet warms. It is crucial for the future of the global food supply to develop effective adaptation strategies. However, not all countries and regions are affected equally by drought. We fit a hierarchical Bayesian model with a dataset containing 60 years of country-level drought and agricultural productivity data to probabilistically identify the susceptibility of various countries and regions to drought. We find that regions such as Eastern Africa and Southern Asia are highly susceptible to drought, with each region exhibiting a >90% chance that drought has negatively affected agriculture, leading to estimated historical agricultural losses of >14%, while Eastern Asia is the most drought-resilient region, with only a 44% probability that drought has negatively affected agriculture in this region. The results of this study can help inform the allocation of future resources to enhance agricultural resilience in the most vulnerable regions. Additionally, they provide a foundation for case studies examining specific countries or regions that demonstrate notable resilience or susceptibility to drought.",

To quantify this uncertainty, we analyze three types of models with physical parameter perturbed large ensembles under global warming levels of 1.5 and 2.0°C. The scenarios use adaptive CO 2 emissions, while non-CO 2 emissions are prescribed. The residual emission budgets in the scenarios are measured in terms of CO 2 forcing equivalent (CO 2 -fe). Our simulations quantify approximately 0.8 (0.2-1.3 for a 90% confidence interval) and 1.9 (0.9-3.0) TtCO 2 -fe for the 1.5 and 2.0°C targets by the end of the 21st century. About 37.5% (73.7%) of the budget for 1.5°C (2.0°C) originates from the CO 2 emission pathways, highlighting the importance of non-CO 2 forcings. Aerosols dominate the uncertainty in non-CO 2 contributions to global responses in both temperature and precipitation. Our modeling results underline the need to constrain the response to each climate forcing, particularly aerosol, to build an accurate mitigation and adaptation plan under the pledges of the Paris Agreement. Moreover, we demonstrate robust differences in global and regional temperature and precipitation responses between the higher and lower CO 2 emission scenarios, highlighting the significance of carbon neutrality.",

      "abstract": "Climate change has led to the transition of droughts into rapid and intensified phenomena known as flash droughts, presenting considerable challenges for risk management, particularly concerning their impact on ecosystem productivity. Quantifying the ecosystem’s capacity to maintain productivity during flash droughts, referred to as ecosystem resistance, is crucial to assess drought impacts. However, it remains uncertain how the resistance of ecosystem productivity to flash drought changes over time. Here we show that vegetation resistance to flash droughts declines by up to 27% (±5%) over the Northern Hemisphere hotspots during 2001-2022, including eastern Asia, western North America, and northern Europe. The notable decline in vegetation resistance is mainly attributed to increased vapour pressure deficit and temperature, and enhanced vegetation structural sensitivity to water availability. Flash droughts pose higher ecological risks than slowly-developing droughts during the growing seasons, where ecosystem productivity experiences faster decline rates with a shorter response time. Our results underscore the limited ecosystem capacity to resist flash droughts under climate change.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the characteristics of agricultural flash droughts (AFDs) and their impacts on critical growth periods of soybean and corn in southeastern South America (SESA). Using ERA5 data from 1960 to 2022, we examine AFD frequency, duration, intensity, trends, seasonality, life cycle, and the influence of land-atmosphere interactions. Historical crop data, spanning different time periods across SESA countries, are analyzed to assess how the spatiotemporal evolution and varying life cycles of AFDs affect crop yields. The highest AFD frequencies (3 to 8 events per decade) occur in the central portion of SESA. These rapidly intensifying events often evolve into seasonal droughts lasting 1.5 to 3 months. Although area-averaged AFD frequency shows no significant change in central SESA, positive trends are noticeable in southern Brazil and Uruguay. Towards the north of SESA, AFDs are less frequent, with 1 to 3 episodes per decade, although the frequency has significantly increased since 1970. AFDs tend to last over 3 months and reach higher intensity. Land-atmosphere feedback mechanisms are reflected in high positive vapor pressure deficit and temperature anomalies that exacerbate soil moisture deficits despite a relatively stable precipitation deficit, accelerating AFD intensification periods. AFDs typically impact smaller areas, while slow-evolving droughts affect larger regions. However, AFDs’ timing during the critical growth periods of the crops can lead to substantial yield losses. In central SESA, AFDs mainly occur between November and January, affecting both crops during their flowering and grain filling in December and January. In northern SESA, AFDs occur later, from February to April, primarily impacting second-season corn. The overall impact on crop yields depends on the duration, spatial extent, and intensity of the drought after its intensification.",

In this study, we assessed the historical (1951-2022) Clausius Clapeyron relation between daily precipitation extremes (P ex ) with daily maximum temperature (T max ) and dew point (DPT) for ten smart cities of Central India. Further, future (2023-2100) assessments have been carried out for SSP 245 and 585 scenarios between T max and different P ex using NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 datasets. The future assessment is further classified for near (NF: 2023-2050) and far (FF:2051-2100) future periods. We determined that historically, T max has not been prominent in enhancing regional P ex . However, DPT enhanced the regional P ex with super scaling rates maximum of 17 %°C −1 . In the future, we observed that scaling rates between T max and P ex enhanced in SSP 245 and 585, respectively. Cities like Satna, Sagar, and Jabalpur tend to have positive scaling in the future. Therefore, DPT is a better predictor of precipitation extremes and assists in precise predictive modeling for enhancing regional urban sustainability and mitigating urban flood risk. However, the rise in T max has influenced the precipitation extremes substantially since the far future period. Overall, it will assist the concerned smart cities policymakers and scientific community in making Indian cities resilient to climate change.",

By the end of the century, ROS will predominantly occur in high-latitude and altitude regions such as High Mountain Asia, the Alps, Northern Eurasia, and America with rates up to three times higher than those of the historical conditions. Nonetheless, the increasing rainfall will reduce by more than half the contribution of ROS to the water available for runoff despite its rise.

Little is known about the mid- to long-term effects that changing snowpack following forest disturbance has on tree re-growth, and how tree re-growth might in turn affect snowpack accumulation and melt. We use a 1-m resolution process-based snow model (SnowPALM) coupled with a stand-scale ecohydrological model (RHESSys) that resolves water, energy and carbon cycling to represent tree growth, and to quantify how trees and snowpack co-evolve following two disturbance scenarios (thinning and clearcutting) over a period of 40 years in a small 100 m x 234 m mid-elevation forested area in the Sierra Nevada, California. We first calculate the impact of forest disturbance on the snowpack assuming no tree regrowth and then we compare it with scenarios that include the feedback of treés regrowth on the snowpack. Without tree regrowth, snow accumulation and melt volume increase on average by roughly 5 % and 13 % following thinning and clearcutting, respectively. With tree regrowth, a regrowth rate of 0.75 and 1.15 m/decade are found for thinning and clearcutting, respectively, along with a decrease of melt volumes of 2.5 to 0.9 mm/decade, respectively. About 50 % of the snowmelt volume gains from forest thinning are lost after 40 years of regrowth, whereas only about 7 % is lost from clearcutting after the same period, which are largely explained by changes to canopy interception and sublimation. This proof-of-concept study is expected to shed light into the coevolution of montane forests and snowpack response to forest disturbance.",

However, we lack fundamental information on the spatial distribution and physical controls on global hydrologic processes. This information is needed to provide theoretical support for large-domain model simulations. Here, to address this issue, we present a global, searchable database of 400 research watersheds with published descriptions of dominant hydrologic flow pathways. This knowledge synthesis approach leverages decades of grant funding, fieldwork effort and local expertise. We use the database to test longstanding hypotheses about the roles of climate, biomes and landforms in controlling hydrologic processes. We show that aridity predicts the depth of water flow pathways and that terrain and biomes predict the prevalence of lateral flow pathways. These new data and search capabilities support efficient hypothesis testing to investigate emergent patterns that relate landscape organization to hydrologic function.",

      "abstract": "Drylands, characterized by fragile ecosystems and severe water shortages, are highly responsive to climatic changes. Recent studies have observed a general wetting trend in Xinjiang, a region covering over one-sixth of China territory and known for its arid climate. However, the spatiotemporal variability of wetting and drying tendencies and their underlying drivers remain poorly understood. Here we utilize the Eulerian moisture tracking model in conjunction with emergent constraining projections to assess trends in moisture dynamics across Xinjiang. Our analysis reveals a prevailing warm-wetting tendency over the past 40 years. We find that moisture influx into Xinjiang predominantly originated from the North Atlantic, traveling through Europe and West Asia, with external sources contributing approximately 89.1 % of the region’s total water vapor. The increased moisture input has driven the observed wetting trend. Constraining projections indicate future increases in precipitation, evaporation, and temperature in Xinjiang, with the rate of change being more pronounced under the SSP585 scenario. Spatially, northern Xinjiang and its mountainous regions exhibit a significant warm-wetting trend, while southern Xinjiang shows a tendency towards warm-drying. Restricting global temperature rises to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, as opposed to 2 °C, could mitigate extreme drying and wetting conditions in the region. These findings underscore the partially wetting trend in drylands and highlight the critical need for stringent climate action to limit global warming to 1.5 °C for effective climate change mitigation.",

This study investigates trends in heatwave characteristics across Iran from 1972 to 2023 using daily ERA5 reanalysis data. Our analysis reveals significant upward trends in heatwave frequency, severity, and duration. In most regions, these changes began between 1998 and 2002. The current average number of heatwaves in Iran is 18 per year, representing a 60% increase compared to the start of the study period. The severity of heatwaves has also risen, with average temperatures now exceeding the threshold by 1.8 C. Copula functions were used to evaluate the probability of simultaneous occurrence of extreme values in the variables of severity, duration and frequency of heat waves. Results show a high likelihood of extreme values occurring simultaneously, particularly for heatwaves with a frequency exceeding 20 events per year, severity above 1.5 C, and durations lasting 7 days or more. These findings highlight a significant increase in the probability of intense and prolonged heatwaves in Iran. Given these concerning results, there is a growing need for further research to evaluate the potential impacts of heat waves as one of the most critical indicators of climate change in the region.",

This study evaluates the performance of seven machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), for streamflow classification. One of the key challenges in this task is the imbalance in class distributions, which can negatively impact model performance. To address this, we apply the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to improve classification outcomes for minority classes. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of four proposed feature selection methods, including mutual information (MI-FS), linear kernel SVM (SVM-FS), random forest (RF-FS), and multi-criteria selection (MC-FS) on model performance by identifying optimal lag values. Model hyperparameters are fine-tuned using GridSearchCV technique, and evaluation step is assessed across seven performance metrics. Experimental results show that MLP and SVM consistently outperform other models, making them the most suitable choices for streamflow classification. Among the FS techniques, MC-FS demonstrates superior performance by effectively reducing dimensionality while preserving predictive power. However, our findings indicate that SMOTE enhances classification for minority classes but reduces accuracy for majority classes, highlighting a trade-off in handling imbalanced data. Additionally, we observe that the linear assumption in SVM-FS can negatively impact model performance when it fails to detect all relevant input features. These insights provide valuable guidance for future streamflow classification tasks.",

Therefore, this research constructed a framework for analyzing landscape structure from two dimensions of landscape element and landscape pattern, selected fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and net primary productivity (NPP) as VAI, determined the response degree and spatial correlation of VAI to landscape structure by using geographical detector and bivariate Moran’s index, and finally obtained the change threshold of VAI based on the constraints of landscape pattern by building a cubic polynomial. FVC and NPP were significantly higher from 2001 to 2021, with the expansion of the high-value areas. Cropland and woodland were the dominant landscape elements. The spatial explanatory power of landscape element for VAI was better than that of landscape pattern characteristics, while the combined factors in landscape structure all explained VAI better than univariate. The response of FVC to landscape structure was more significant compared to NPP. The high value areas of FVC tended to occur in natural landscape elements. FVC showed spatial correlation and clustering characteristics with both PD and LPI. One or more thresholds existed in the response of FVC to changes in landscape pattern. The research results have important reference value in the optimization of landscape structure and vegetation restoration, and can provide practical guidance for the sustainable development of the ecosystem.",

Total rainfall accumulation per seasonal snowpack duration has increased across western mountain ranges, with the Olympic Mountains experiencing more than 40 mm of additional rainfall over the snowpack in the past eight decades, followed by the Sierra Nevada.

Drought begins under the influence of meteorological processes and propagates to hydrological drought, which human activities affect. In this study, an Anthropogenic Drought Index (ADI) was developed using two meteorological indices (Standardized Precipitation Index [SPI] and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index [SPEI]) and two hydrological indices (Standardized Streamflow Index [SSI] and Streamflow Drought Index [SDI]). The ADI considers the meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics of duration, severity, and frequency. To assess drought risk, the ADI was used as a hazard along with the vulnerability index, which also takes into account the socioeconomic and physical factors of the study area. The developed formulation was applied to the western part of the Lake Urmia basin, which has dried in recent years due to unsustainable water resources management. The study area covered 20 stations with 40-year meteorological and hydrological data. A visual comparison of the meteorological and hydrological indices shows that human behavior has significantly increased the hydrological drought characteristics over the past 20 years. The ADI results indicate that in some stations, the ADI values exceed 2, highlighting the need for sustainable water withdrawal in these areas. The risk assessment results also classify the studied stations into five bands, prioritizing them from the viewpoint of drought risk management.",

      "abstract": "Differentiable parameterized learning (dPL) represents a cutting-edge advancement in synergizing process-based models (PBMs) and machine learning to improve both the model prediction and interpretability. However, dPL mainly focuses on refining parameters within a predefined process-based structure, which limits its performance and process understanding to the constraints of existing PBM frameworks. To address this limitation, we propose an extended framework: Differentiable Process and Parameter Learnings (dP2Ls). dP2Ls incorporate regionalized neural networks (NNs) to simultaneously improve both the modeling of process variables and parameter learnings. Within dP2Ls, the EXP-HYDRO model serves as a differentiable physical backbone, where the potential evapotranspiration (PET) process is modeled using a regionalized long short-term memory (LSTM), while the dPL strategy is independently applied to learning hydrological parameters. Experiments with runoff prediction in ungauged catchments across the contiguous United States revealed that: (1) The median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of regionalized dP2Ls in ungauged catchments surpassed that of all models using NNs for either process learning or parameter learning and approached the LSTM model (the median NSE differs by only 0.021); (2) Regionalized dP2Ls enhanced the interpretability of some intermediate variables by jointly learning the process variables and parameters, resulting in the correlation coefficients of snowpack and ET fitting the estimation products increased by 0.022 and 0.026, respectively; (3) The embedded regionalized LSTM outputs more interpretable PET than EXP-HYDRO, demonstrating the capability of NNs to improve traditional process understanding. In summary, this study demonstrates the advantages of dP2Ls in regionalized modeling, overcoming the limitations of traditional process-based structures through flexible NN configurations, and providing a reliable pathway for the future in-depth diagnosis and transformation of existing hydrological knowledge using NNs.",

From 1901 to 2021, rural populations experienced 2.5 times the total exposure to CDHWs compared to urban populations. Over the past three decades, however, urban populations have experienced significantly higher exposure and a faster rate of increase than rural populations. Regionally, rural populations in Asia, North America, and Africa accounted for 41.06, 16.51, and 13.69% of the total global rural population exposure, respectively, while urban populations in Asia, North America, and Europe accounted for 32.31, 18.70, and 16.85% of global urban exposure, respectively. The climate-population interactive effects have been the dominant factors driving recent changes in population exposure. Our findings contribute to the risk assessment of CDHWs at both global and regional levels and provide reliable information for disaster prevention and mitigation strategies.",

      "abstract": "Wildfires cause large damage to natural and human systems. Despite the clear connection between human-induced climate change and increased fire weather risk, a global, systematic attribution of observed extreme fires to human-induced climate change is lacking. Here, we address this gap by first linking observed regional weekly burned area extremes (>85th percentile) to the fire weather index (FWI) during the fire seasons of 2002-2015 via a logistic regression model, and then using simulations from climate models to quantify the impact of human-induced climate change. Focusing on regions with good predictability of the statistical model, we find that human-induced climate change was responsible for a fraction equal to 8% (±4%, standard deviation across climate models) of the predicted probability of more than 700 regional fire extremes on average, thereby increasing the probability of experiencing a fire extreme across 15 out of 19 analysed regions. While higher temperature is the main driver of the increased fire extreme probability, shifts in precipitation, relative humidity, and/or wind speed substantially modulated fire changes across many regions. Mainly because of warming, the probability of extreme fires attributable to human-induced climate change increased by 5.2%/decade globally over 2002-2015, in line with an acceleration of the climate-driven enhancement of fire extremes over the last decades that may continue in the near future. These findings highlight the urgent need for sustainable fire management strategies.",

      "abstract": "The frequency and severity of compound drought and hot events are increasing, making it crucial to explore the climatic background of their intensification. Warm-dry conditions, which consider both temperature and precipitation, can effectively reflect the climatic characteristics of the compound events. Therefore, in-depth research focusing on warm-dry conditions is especially necessary. This study employs a standardized index to assess the warm-dry conditions during the warm season (May to September) in the eastern China. The Brubaker model is used to quantify contributions of water vapor transport and to explore the relationship between water vapor transport and warm-dry conditions. Additionally, land-atmosphere coupling strength indices (CSI) and atmospheric circulation patterns are analyzed to explore the impacts of surface energy, atmospheric circulation and land-atmosphere feedback on warm-dry conditions. The main results are as follows: There is a warming and drying trend in the eastern China, especially prominent in a strip extending from Northeast to North and then to Southwest China. In Northeast China (NEC), North China (NC), Southwest China (SWC), and eastern Northwest China (ENWC), warm season precipitation is mainly from western water vapor, whose reduction contributes to the strengthening warm-dry conditions. In Southeast China (SEC), southern water vapor dominates precipitation and predominates the changes in warm-dry conditions. During severe warm-dry conditions, surface temperature, surface sensible heat flux, and surface net solar radiation increase, while soil moisture decreases. The geopotential height above the study area is higher than normal during severe warm-dry conditions, which favors subsidence movement and leads to adiabatic warming of the atmosphere. Additionally, ENWC, NC, and SWC (Yunnan Province) are characterized by strong land-atmosphere feedback, which can further intensify warming and drying in these areas.",

      "abstract": "Inland waters emit large amounts of carbon and are key players in the global carbon budget. Particularly high rates of carbon emissions have been reported in streams draining mountains, tropical regions, and peatlands. However, few studies have examined the spatial variability of CO 2 concentrations and fluxes occurring within these systems, particularly as a function of catchment morphology. Here we evaluated spatial patterns of CO 2 in three tropical, headwater catchments in relation to the river network and stream geomorphology. We measured dissolved carbon dioxide ( p CO 2 ), aquatic CO 2 emissions, discharge, and stream depth and width at high spatial resolutions along multiple stream reaches. Confirming previous studies, we found that tropical headwater streams are an important source of CO 2 to the atmosphere. More notably, we found marked, predictable spatial organization in aquatic carbon fluxes as a function of landscape position. For example, p CO 2 was consistently high (>10,000 ppm) at locations close to groundwater sources and just downstream of hydrologically connected wetlands, but consistently low (<1,000 ppm) in high gradient locations or river segments with larger drainage areas. Taken together, our findings suggest that catchment area and stream slope are important drivers of p CO 2 and gas transfer velocity ( k ) in mountainous streams, and as such they should be considered in catchment-scale assessments of CO 2 emissions. Furthermore, our work suggests that accurate estimation of CO 2 emissions requires understanding of dynamics across the entire stream network, from the smallest seeps to larger streams.",

Yet, these ecosystems are highly vulnerable to changing temperatures and may undergo critical transitions under ongoing climate change. What we do not know is to what extent montane biodiversity and ecosystem services will respond to local temperature variations in a gradual versus abrupt manner across global environments. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a global synthesis, including 4,462 observations from 290 elevation gradients, to investigate how biodiversity (spanning animals and plants) and ecosystem services (including plant production, soil carbon, and fertility) respond to local temperature variations along elevation gradients. We found that nearly one-third of these gradients exhibited abrupt shifts in multiple biodiversity and ecosystem services in response to local variations in temperature along elevation gradients. More specifically, we showed that once a particular local temperature level (~10 °C for mean annual temperature) was reached, even small increases in temperature resulted in dramatic variations in biodiversity and ecosystem services. We further showed that those abrupt shifts in response to local temperature increases were commonly positive for plant and animal diversity, as well as plant production, while soil carbon and fertility more commonly exhibit negative abrupt trends. Our work, based on the most comprehensive empirical evidence available so far, reveals the pervasive abrupt responses of biodiversity and ecosystem services to local temperature variations in montane ecosystems worldwide, highlighting the highly sensitive nature of montane ecosystems in the context of climate change.",

This study compares summertime compound heatwaves in 722 urban-rural station pairs globally on an event-by-event basis during 1971-2017 and attributes their difference to numerous urbanization and climatological factors using interpretable machine learning methods. Here we find a discernible earlier onset (0.23 ± 0.04 days) of compound heatwaves in cities compared to rural areas. The magnitude of this influence is primarily determined by urban building volume and height rather than the artificial impervious surface fraction, and is exacerbated by climates characterized by warm night and ample daytime solar radiation. Taller buildings significantly advance onset in cloudy, warm, and humid climates, while larger building volumes lead to earlier onset of compound heatwaves across nearly all climates. Our findings suggest that cities, particularly those with large building volumes, should issue heatwave warnings earlier.",

      "abstract": "Groundwater resource management faces significant challenges due to groundwater overdraft and waterlogging. Establishing thresholds of the water table depth (WTD) is crucial to ascertain whether WTDs align with ranges conducive to the health of social-ecological systems. However, existing studies often overlook multiple protection targets, dominant targets across different seasons, and spatial variations of thresholds. The long-term effects of WTDs exceeding threshold ranges of the WTD also need to be further explored. Here we propose a novel framework for calculating grid-scale thresholds across seasons, incorporating multiple targets. This framework calculates frequency, duration, and magnitude metrics, offering an evaluation of multiple groundwater management targets over decades. We apply this framework to the lower Tao'er River Basin in China, revealing threshold depths for shallow water tables ranges of 1.16-2.05 m and 1.16-4.05 m during non-growth and growth periods, while threshold depths for deep water tables ranges from 6.28-33.54 m and 1.96-30.72 m, respectively. Climate change scenarios demonstrate minimal frequency changes but significant deterioration in duration and magnitude compared to the historical scenario. Grids with duration of transgressions more than 12 months expand by 1-2 times, while grids exceeding thresholds of the WTD by 2 m increase by 37%-81% under climate change and intensified pumping scenarios. A 20% increase in groundwater pumping leads to an average rise of 151%, 224%, and 147% deterioration in frequency, duration, and magnitude. Furthermore, 1%-6% of grids face dual challenges of groundwater storage reduction and waterlogging. These findings can inform groundwater resource management under various potential futures.",

Understanding how the carbon-water coupling (CWC) changes, which remains rarely explored, is essential for predicting eco-hydrological responses to climate change. Here, using data from eddy covariance towers and remote sensing, we demonstrate a substantial decline in the CWC strength-measured as the correlation between gross primary production and evapotranspiration-across northern ecosystems over the past two decades. This weakening is primarily driven by rising CO2 levels, with temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation playing secondary roles. Land surface models in the TRENDY project fail to capture this weakening synchronization, primarily due to their inadequate representation of the effects of elevated atmospheric CO 2 levels. The weakening of this synchronous variation between water and carbon may signify that the ecosystems are reshaping their eco-hydrological balances across the Northern Hemisphere.",

We identify a reversed asymmetrical warming pattern characterized by intensified daytime warming since the 1980s. Driven by the alterations of the warming pattern, adverse effects of daytime warming on GPP rapidly expanded during 1982-2016, especially in arid regions.

Despite this, there remains a scarcity of studies delving into the transition from meteorological to hydrological droughts and the influencing factors operating at the event level. Using long-term observations spanning nominally from 1979 to 2017, we identified and matched meteorological and hydrological droughts based on standardized drought indices across 1089 catchments globally, and examined the characteristics of drought propagation and their determinants at both catchment and event scales. Our analysis reveals that, at the catchment scale, drought severity weakens in approximately 65% of catchments, while intensity experiences a decline in 96% of catchments during the propagation. Moreover, we find that the propagation ratio of severity (or intensity) is significantly and negatively correlated with the severity (or intensity) of meteorological droughts. This implies that major drought events tend to undergo more substantial attenuation in severity (or intensity) during propagation compared to minor droughts. This finding is also obtained at the event scale. Moreover, we find that the event-scale drought propagation ratio (for both severity and intensity) tends to be higher (indicating less attenuation) in catchments characterized by larger seasonal precipitation variation, higher snowfall fraction, steeper slopes, or larger soil water holding capacity. Conversely, it is lower (indicating more dampening) in catchments with dense vegetation cover. These findings offer crucial insights into drought propagation dynamics across catchments globally, thereby informing the development of more effective drought monitoring and management strategies.",

      "abstract": "Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) provides valuable insights into plant stress by detecting reductions in photosynthesis that frequently occur during drought. Unlike climate-based drought indices, SIF directly measures the photosynthetic activity and vitality of vegetation, providing a unique and real-time perspective for examining the effects of water stress. The vegetation water stress index (SIF-Di) is calculated using a probabilistic method, and a meteorological composite drought index (CDI) is employed to monitor vegetation health and drought conditions. The probabilistic approach categorizes monthly SIF anomalies based on percentiles, with lower percentiles indicating more severe vegetation water stress. A dynamic time warping approach is employed to investigate how SIF responds to climatic drought. The SIF-Di captures vegetation water stress activity well across global river basins. The results revealed that the Amazon basin has a CDI that leads the SIF-Di by 5.94 ± 6.24 lag times, suggesting that vegetation water stress develops gradually due to the dense rainforest canopy, as deep-rooted vegetation allows plants to tap into subsurface water, which increases resiliency and delays stress during prolonged dry periods. The SIF-Di and CDI offer a new approach to drought intensity, particularly in basins where climate drought affects vegetation with a relatively small lag. For example, the Mackenzie and Danube basins, with lags of 0.68 ± 1.63 and 0.84 ± 1.89 months, respectively, are vulnerable to drought and act as models for estimating drought response mechanisms. This study could enhance the predictability of drought onset and severity by anticipating the time difference between vegetation water stress and climatic drought.",

      "abstract": "Grape yield and quality are tightly linked to soil moisture (SM), making SM monitoring critical, especially as climate change increases reliance on irrigation in rain-fed areas. Sentinel-1 (S1) radar and Sentinel-2 (S2) optical satellites offer valuable high-resolution, frequent data streams ideal for measuring surface SM dynamics. However, despite the recognized potential of satellite remote sensing, Change Detection (CD) techniques have not been widely applied for SM monitoring within more challenging hillside grapevine vineyard environments. To address this gap, this study developed and validated two CD methods for retrieving SM at 20 m resolution using Google Earth Engine. The first method (CD S2 ) used S2 optical bands (Red, NIR, SWIR), while the second (CD S1S2 ) combined S1’s C-band radar (VV polarization) with S2 optical data. The methods were tested in two hillside vineyards (northern/southern Italy) and validated using independent reference data from flat bushlands (TxSON, Texas). Comparisons with in-situ measurements showed both methods effectively captured SM dynamics. However, combining S1 and S2 data (CD S1S2 ) provided significantly more accurate estimates than using S2 alone (CD S2 ), achieving higher R2 (0.23-0.41 vs. 0.16-0.21) and lower RMSE (3.6-5.7 % vs. 3.8-7.1 % [m3/m3]). This improvement is attributed to S1's ability to penetrate vegetation and operate under various atmospheric conditions. This research demonstrates a scalable, user-friendly, and reproducible geospatial approach for precision viticulture. It highlights the potential of integrating advanced remote sensing technologies to enhance vineyard water management and sustain agricultural productivity amidst environmental changes.",

      "abstract": "Reservoir operations have complex and profound impacts on local climate, particularly precipitation. Quantifying this impact is challenging because it requires the reconstruction of natural precipitation prior to reservoir operation. Instead of assuming that the natural variability of the contrast region and the study region is identical, this study develops an interpretable machine learning model to investigate relationships between precipitation-influencing factors and precipitation itself, including both stable components (sum of trend and seasonality from STL decomposition) and random components (residuals after removing trend and seasonality), which is then used to forecast natural precipitation in the absence of reservoir operation. The application in the contrast region verifies the forecast's accuracy, even in mountainous areas. The proposed method is used to analyze the impact of three large-scale reservoirs along the Yangtze River on local precipitation, collectively having a total storage capacity of 17.86 × 10 9 m 3 . The results indicate that reservoir operation leads to a 14% increase in the trend and seasonal components of precipitation, which would be underestimated by previous methods. In addition, there is a noticeable shift in the precipitation center toward the reservoir. Further comparisons suggest that reservoir operation shifts the key influencing factors of local precipitation patterns from those characterized by high variability to those characterized by low variability. Changes in soil water retention capacity likely play a significant role in these precipitation changes. We also found a significant positive coupling between soil moisture and precipitation in the study area, which has been a focal point of recent research. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms through which reservoir construction impacts precipitation.",

      "abstract": "Drylands with fragile ecosystems and severe water shortages are particularly vulnerable to climatic change. Northwestern China (NWC), a typical arid region, faces uncertainty regarding future wetting or drying trends. A comprehensive assessment and projection of these conditions are crucial for water resource management. In this study, we employ a Lagrangian trajectory model, optimal fingerprint analysis, and a maximum covariance technique to evaluate wetting and/or drying trends in NWC over the historical (1981-2023) and future (2024-2099) periods. Our results show that over 80% of NWC experienced increases in air temperature, precipitation, and evaporation during the historical period. External and internal water vapor sources contribute 92% and 8%, respectively, to precipitation changes. Incoming water vapor predominantly originated from the North Atlantic (31.9%) and the South China Sea - Bay of Bengal region (39.3%), with a strong positive correlation ( r = 0.71) between Atlantic sea surface temperatures and precipitation minus evaporation in NWC. Water vapor enters NWC from the southern, northern, and western boundaries, while 83.4% escapes through the eastern boundary. The precipitation trend is strongly influenced by the combined effects of anthropogenic and natural forcings, accounting for 36.8% to the observed increase. Under a 1.5°C warming scenario, warming-wetting regions shift northward, whereas higher warming levels (2°C, 3°C, 4°C) cause these regions to shift southeastward and shrink. Our findings underscore NWC's high sensitivity to climate warming and highlight the pressing challenge of water security in a warming world.",

Presently, the numerical computation of infiltration equations grounded in physical theories is intricate and frequently constrained by stability challenges. Empirical infiltration equations, which are formulated from experiments conducted at either point or field scales, still necessitate additional methodologies for effective hydrological modeling. Consequently, there is a pressing demand for an innovative watershed-scale infiltration theory to further the discipline of hydrology. This research introduces a watershed-scale rainfall infiltration equation incorporating water and energy constraints. This equation accurately represents the rainfall infiltration process at the watershed scale, and its derivative contributes to an enhanced comprehension of infiltration dynamics. Furthermore, the equation was validated utilizing the CAMELS-US dataset, which encompasses 350 watersheds. The average Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) during the validation period indicated an improvement of 0.07 relative to the SCS-CN model, illustrating its robust adaptability across diverse watersheds and climatic conditions. These results offer valuable insights for the advancement of foundational hydrological theories.",

      "abstract": "Streams and rivers worldwide are heavily affected by human intervention and are often degraded despite the numerous ecosystem services they provide. The degradation is particularly severe in water-stressed regions and arid and semi-arid areas. Various indices have been developed to assess the health of streams and rivers and the ecosystem services they provide. However, existing indices need improvement to provide a straightforward tool for assessing the complexity of stream ecosystems in water-stressed climates while also accounting for the ecosystem services provided by streams and rivers. To achieve this goal, we developed the Stream Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity Index (SESBI), which evaluates the health of streams based on six ecosystem services they provide: biodiversity conservation, water purification, riparian buffer zones, flood mitigation, recreation/ecotourism, and landscape ecology. The SESBI framework was developed based on existing literature, experts' in-depth interviews, and questionnaires, focusing on ES indicators that reflect ecological functioning and management priorities in water-stressed climates. We applied the SESBI to three streams in Israel and validated its performance using expert assessments and available data. Comparisons with local experts' ratings showed strong alignment, confirming the index's reliability and adaptability. To our knowledge, this study is the first to use ecosystem services as proxies to assess stream health in arid and semi-arid climates as a tool to monitor changes before and after rehabilitation. While designed for streams, this approach can be adapted for rivers with appropriate modifications. The index methodology developed in this research provides a valuable tool for planners, stakeholders, and decision-makers, offering an accessible yet scientifically robust approach to assessing and prioritizing ecosystem rehabilitation plans. This research contributes to the sustainable management of ecosystems on theoretical, empirical, and practical levels by simplifying the complexity of stream ecosystems into a practical and easy-to-apply framework.",

In this study, we developed NMH-CS 3.0, a hydrological model written in C# (pronounced C sharp). NMH-CS 3.0 is a new model developed by faithfully translating Noah-MP, written in Fortran, from the uncoupled WRF-Hydro 3.0, and it is coupled with a river routing model. NMH-CS has the capacity to be executed on Windows systems, utilizing the multi-core CPUs commonly available in today's personal computers. The code of NMH-CS has been tested to ensure that it produces a high degree of consistency with the output of the original WRF-Hydro. High-resolution (6 km) simulations were conducted and assessed over a grid domain covering the entire Yellow River basin and most of northern China. The spatial maps and temporal variations in many state variables simulated by NMH-CS 3.0 and WRF-Hydro/Noah-MP demonstrate highly consistent results, occasionally with minor discrepancies. The river discharge for the Yellow River simulated by the new model with various scheme combinations of six parameterizations exhibits general agreement with the natural river discharge at the Lanzhou station. NMH-CS can be regarded as a reliable replica of Noah-MP in WRF-Hydro 3.0, but it can leverage the modern, powerful, and user-friendly features brought by the C# language to significantly improve the efficiency of the model's users and developers.",

      "abstract": "Extensive studies have revealed the compound impact of high Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) and low Soil Moisture (SM) on global Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), but their relative importance and nonlinear effects remain uncertain due to their covariation. Herein, based on the CMIP6 outputs, we examined the global GPP, SM, and VPD variation under baseline (1982-2014) and four future scenarios (2015-2100), clarified the dominant force on GPP by decoupling the effects of SM and VPD; further, we explored critical threshold and costs of dominant force on GPP, identified global drought zoning, and proposed optimization strategy. The results show that GPP will experience an increasing trend, and the growth rate is higher in the Northern Hemisphere; except for the SSP5-8.5, soil tends to be moist, but atmospheric dryness is obvious, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. SM dominates the GPP variation, but its impact influence differs across vegetation types and scenarios. There is an inverted U-shaped relationship between SM and GPP in forests and shrublands; GPP and SM exhibit positive reinforcing feedback in croplands and grasslands; but a negative feedback is found in savannas. The threshold and SM cost increase with rising CO 2 , enhancing water use efficiency is the key to alleviating the high SM costs for vegetation growth in high CO 2 emission scenarios. SM-drier zones constitute more than 70% of the global land and expand significantly, particularly in forests and grasslands, highlighting the vulnerability of these vegetation to severer soil water deficits; SM in 12.25% to 20.8% of the vegetated land is within the elastic range, dominated by savannas, revealing its strong self-adaptive ability; SM-wetter zones occupy the smallest area and exhibit a marked decreasing trend, mainly in croplands and shrublands. For different vegetation, targeted mitigation strategies must be adopted to enhance their drought resilience.",

      "abstract": "Reduced snow cover is becoming increasingly common in the Arctic-Boreal region under amplified warming, complicating efforts to isolate its specific impacts on plant productivity during the subsequent snow-free seasons. Here, we compiled a multi-source remote sensing dataset to disentangle the effects of warming-independent reduced snow cover across the northern permafrost region over the past 30 years. In years with shortened snow cover duration but normal climate conditions, gross primary productivity increased by a rate of 1.48 g C m −2 for every 10-day shortened snow cover duration and normalized difference vegetation index of 0.0024 in regions with increased soil temperature compared to the long-term mean. This productivity boost was primarily driven by shortened snow cover duration and early snowmelt, which enhanced soil heat uptake, accelerated permafrost thaw, and improved plant water and nutrient availability, thereby advancing spring greening. This study offers valuable insights into Arctic-Boreal climate feedback under a warming climate.",

      "abstract": "The concentration of pollen in the atmosphere is shaped by complex interactions between meteorology, climate, land use and human activities. Understanding these factors is crucial for allergy and asthma sufferers to better manage their conditions. This study examines the influence of weather and climate variables on pollen concentrations and pollen seasons in three Australian cities, using over 13, 16 and 32 years of long-term pollen data. El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), drought, rainfall and vegetation index are among the major variables considered in the study. Grass pollen concentration (seasonal average) increased in Canberra (∼200 % per decade) and Sydney (∼34 % per decade) and likely decreased in Melbourne (∼13 % per decade). Melbourne showed an earlier onset and longer duration of the core grass pollen season. Long-term maximum temperature increased in Melbourne and Sydney while decreased in Canberra during the study years. Long-term daily pollen concentrations depicted a decreasing trend in Melbourne ( p < 0.01) and increasing in Sydney (p < 0.01) and Canberra (p < 0.01). Daily maximum temperature had positive associations with daily pollen concentrations, while daily rainfall and humidity were negatively associated. Interannual variability in grass and other pollen concentrations was influenced by large-scale climate phenomena (ENSO cycle, Indian Ocean Dipole). Differential impacts were seen among grass and other pollen during drought and non-drought years in Melbourne. Spring rainfall ( r = 0.5-0.7) and EVI ( r = 0.3-0.9) had positive correlations with seasonal grass pollen. The findings from this study provide valuable insights for healthcare, scientific community and urban planning activities, especially in managing the health risks posed by allergenic pollen in a changing climate.",

      "abstract": "Hydraulic erosion-induced soil loss critically undermines soil fertility, leading to vegetation degradation, reduced crop yields, and increased flood and pollution risks, thereby threatening food security, ecological integrity, and economic stability. Existing soil erosion estimations using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model are constrained by the absence of high-resolution (30 m) nationwide rainfall data, significant spatial and temporal inconsistencies among multi-source data, and limited regional adaptability of empirical RUSLE parameters. To address these challenges, we developed the first 30-m resolution Hydraulic Soil Erosion Dataset (CSWED) for Chinese mainland, spanning from 1990 to 2022. This was achieved by implementing a Random Forest (RF) interpolation method to generate 30-m annual rainfall data and designing a multi-equation combined vegetation cover management factor tailored to China’s diverse soil characteristics. The mean absolute error (MAE) compared to the China Soil and Water Conservation Bulletin was 9.48%, and the CSWED illustrates good consistency with collected runoff plot observation data, significantly surpassing the accuracy of existing publicly available datasets. Our analysis reveals a predominant influence of slope length, steepness, and support practice factors on soil erosion, coupled with a synergistic effect of vegetation cover and topography. Notably, soil erosion in Chinese mainland has exhibited an overall decreasing trend from 1990 to 2022, with significant reductions in light, moderate, and severe erosion categories by 31.70%, 22.24%, and 44.74%, respectively. Also, the sensitivity of soil erosion in 2022 was dominated by strong sensitivity and moderate sensitivity, accounting for 74.149% and 14.072%. Then, the decrease in cropland area creates a decrease in soil erosion of 123.54 t/hm 2 from 1990 to 2022, while for every additional hectare of forested area, soil erosion was reduced by 58.67 t. Special attention should be given to the substantial expansion of soil erosion brought on by extreme rainfall in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River (MLYR) and Southwest China (SWC), where mean soil erosion was 11.71 t/(hm 2 a) and 15.79 t/(hm 2 a), respectively, accounting for 60% of the national total.",

      "abstract": "Investigating soil erosion in South China, one of China’s most populous coastal regions, is crucial for understanding regional soil and water conservation, preventing soil degradation, and safeguarding food security. However, significant discrepancies persist among existing estimates of soil erosion, calling for further evaluation of long-term trends in its magnitude and spatial-temporal dynamics. This study utilized the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model to assess soil erosion dynamics over 35 years, and further evaluated the influence of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Our findings revealed a general decline in soil erosion across South China, dominated by slight and mild erosion. However, the spatiotemporal patterns exhibited marked variations depending on NDVI datasets, particularly in interannual fluctuations and spatial discrepancies. The soil erosion modulus estimated from AVHRR NDVI demonstrated higher values and greater variability than those based on GIMMS NDVI. Spatially, three out of five datasets indicated a consistent reduction in erosion intensity, while two AVHRR datasets showed an initial decline followed by a resurgence over the past decade. Variations in NDVI data can lead to order-of-magnitude differences in soil erosion estimates, highlighting the need for careful dataset selection for soil erosion analysis. A comprehensive analysis and understanding of these differences are needed to provide valuable insights into the applicability of various NDVI datasets in future soil erosion modeling and risk assessment.",

It represents one of the most critical and direct human interventions on the coupled water and energy cycles. As irrigated farmland continues to expand, understanding the climate impact of extensive irrigation becomes increasingly important. Yet, the effect on rainfall patterns near irrigated areas remains unclear. Here, using two global, high-resolution, sub-daily precipitation datasets, we show that afternoon rain events occur more often 10 km to 50 km downwind and less often upwind of extensively irrigated land. However, we also find that the total amount of heavy afternoon rain downwind of irrigated areas is lower than upwind. Our results establish large-scale observational evidence of the local precipitation dynamics surrounding irrigated areas; these insights will help constrain the representation of these processes in next-generation climate and weather forecasting models and provide valuable insights for regional water management.",

Our analysis emphasizes the role of atmospheric evaporative demand in shaping future drought severity, along with its drivers, impact processes, and responses to global warming, while highlighting related observational and theoretical challenges. We also shed light on the uncertainties and limitations of Earth system models (ESMs) in assessing future drought severity. We explore the complexities of ESMs in accurately representing plant physiological and hydrological processes, which are crucial for evaluating drought severity. Our discussion also delves into the nuanced effects of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations on these processes and on water dynamics within ESMs, helping to clarify conceptual issues related to atmospheric drought indices. Finally, we advocate for a balanced evaluation of drought metrics, emphasizing the importance of considering multiple atmospheric processes in drought projections.",

      "abstract": "While global vegetation shows widespread greening under climate change, the corresponding impacts on Net Ecosystem Production (NEP)-particularly the divergent responses between drylands and non-drylands-remain poorly understood. In this study, based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF), Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), and NEP, we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation photosynthesis and NEP across Eurasia from 1982 to 2018, and explored their differential responses to environmental factors, with particular focus on the contrasting mechanisms between drylands and non-drylands. The results showed that the rate of increase in NEP standardized anomalies (0.004 yr −1 , p < 0.05) lagged behind NDVI/SIF/GPP standardized anomalies (0.009 − 0.014 yr −1 , p < 0.01), particularly after 2000, and it was more pronounced in drylands. Spatially, vegetation photosynthesis and NEP changed asynchronously in nearly one-third of Eurasia, with a slightly higher proportion in non-dryland areas and the most obvious patterns in forests and croplands. Explainable machine learning analysis revealed that this asynchrony was primarily driven by interactions among temperature, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and evapotranspiration. Vegetation photosynthesis was mainly influenced by evapotranspiration, while NEP was constrained by increased VPD. Moreover, in drylands, NEP was highly sensitive to atmospheric moisture, whereas in non-drylands, temperature fluctuations played a dominant role. These findings offer important insights for regional carbon sequestration management and climate change adaptation strategies.",

The emission offsets 28.1 ± 2.1% of the land carbon uptake in the Northern Hemisphere permafrost zone, with large regional variability of 13.1 to 63.1%. Our findings suggest that CO 2 emissions increased at a rate of 0.42 ± 0.16 Tg C yr− 1 during 2000 to 2020, and this is primarily driven by increased precipitation and accelerated permafrost thawing under climate change.

      "abstract": "Ongoing and sharply increased global forest fires, especially extreme large-scale fires (LFs) with their greater destructiveness, have significantly altered forest structures and functions. However, long-term variations in the severity of LFs and corresponding effects on the natural post-LF recovery time of global forests remain unclear. Here, we rigorously identified 3,281 global large-scale (>10 km 2 ) single-time fire events (LSFs) from 2001 to 2021, and used multiple indicators to understand the post-LSF recovery dynamics from different perspectives and comprehensively reveal major driving factors across regions and forests types based on multiple models. Compared with pre-2010, LSFs after 2010 caused greater forest damage, with the fire severity expanding further from low to high latitudes and from humid to arid regions, particularly affecting evergreen needleleaf forests. Fewer than one-third of the forests recovered successfully within 7 years, and most of these were tropical, moisture-rich broadleaf forests. The average time required for three indicators to recover to pre-fire conditions increased by 7.5% (vegetation density), 11.1% (canopy structure) and 27.3% (gross primary productivity). Moreover, the positive sensitivity of recovery time to increased fire severity was significantly intensified. Notably, more forests experienced recovery stagnation with increased severity, especially in boreal forests, further extending recovery time. The negative impact of the severity of LSFs on forest recovery was much stronger than that of post-LSF climate conditions. Soil moisture after LSFs was identified as the primary facilitating factor. Temperature generally had a positive role before 2010, but a strong negative influence on post-LSF forest recovery after 2010. These findings provide a useful reference for better understanding global forest recovery mechanisms, estimating forest carbon sinks and implementing post-LSF management accordingly.",

      "abstract": "Humid heatwaves are a growing risk to human and animal health, especially in tropical regions. While there is established research on dry-bulb temperature heatwaves, greater understanding of the meteorological drivers of extreme humid heat is urgently needed. In this study, we find that recent rainfall is a key control on the occurrence of humid heatwaves in the tropics and subtropics and its effect is regulated by the energy- or moisture-limited state of the land surface. In moisture-limited environments, heatwaves are likely during, or immediately after, enhanced rainfall. In energy-limited environments, heatwaves are likely after suppression of rainfall for two days or longer. The nature of the threat to health from heat stress varies by environment. It depends on local adaptation to temperature or humidity extremes, as well as vulnerability to absolute or anomalous extremes. Early warning systems, which reduce exposure and vulnerability to weather extremes, can benefit from this understanding of humid heatwave drivers, highlighting the possibility of predicting events using satellite-derived rainfall and surface moisture data.",

      "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) describes the sum of water transfer from the ground surface through soil evaporation and water loss from leaf stomata into the atmosphere − critical factors linking the global water and carbon cycles. Myriad ET models based on remote sensing data provide spatially continuous estimates of ET; however, leaf photosynthetic information is critical to ensure accurate ET estimates, which are difficult to measure from space. Remotely sensed sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) provides a proxy of stomatal conductance activity with high performance in predicting plant transpiration, which can account for a large proportion of terrestrial and riverine ET. This study aims to improve estimates of tree water use in semi-arid to arid environments. In this study, a fixed stomatal conductance model and three SIF-driven canopy conductance (g sc ) models were applied to model potential ET (PET). The models estimated PET using the Penman-Monteith equation with: (1) a constant leaf stomatal conductance; (2) a transpiration-driven g sc model; (3) a g sc model based on electron-transfer rate and vapor pressure deficit, and a (4) Ball-Berry stomatal conductance model. A machine learning model was then applied to scale PET to actual ET (AET) using remote sensing and climate data. Accordingly, four AET models were cross-validated with in-situ measured AET at 52 sites, including 21 eddy covariance flux tower sites, and 31 sap-flow measurement sites (semi-arid and plantation area), for various plant functional types in Australia. This study demonstrated that SIF effectively captured seasonal variations of g sc , finding that AET models with SIF-driven g sc models correlated well with in-situ measured AET (R 2 = 0.64). Modelled AET with dynamic variations of g sc generated lower prediction error (0.85 mm day −1 ), while the AET model with fixed stomatal conductance tended to overestimate AET in floodplains and underestimate it in evergreen broadleaf forests, indicating using fixed stomatal conductance results in unstable performance when modelling AET. This study demonstrated that SIF-driven AET models improved broadscale estimation of ET. Our findings provide vital broadscale hydrological data to assist catchment and regional water management, particularly over unmonitored areas at risk of future climate-driven reductions in rainfall.",

      "abstract": "Changes in driving factors can directly impact runoff variation and indirectly alter it through the runoff sensitivity coefficients. This study has broken through the problem of ignoring the dynamic change of runoff sensitivity coefficients in previous studies, and attributed the runoff change to runoff sensitivity coefficients and driving factors. The contribution rate of runoff sensitivity coefficients to runoff change was quantified based on the improved Budyko equation. The results showed that: (1) From 1960 to 2022, the annual runoff of the main rivers in Gansu Province decreased from the southeast to the northwest, with a range of 9.1 mm- 309.6 mm. The number of significantly reduced rivers accounted for 75 %. The mutation years of annual runoff were mainly concentrated between 1970 and 2010. (2) From 1960 to 2022, the annual precipitation decreased from southeast to northwest, the annual potential evapotranspiration increased from southeast to northwest, and the annual temperature decreased from northeast to southwest. Land use conversion was frequent between 1980 and 2020, with a total conversion area of 30 %. (3) The runoff sensitivity coefficients had spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Precipitation and the characteristic parameters of the underlying surface were the main driving factors for the change of runoff sensitivity coefficients in most rivers. (4) In addition to the Dang River, Shiyang River, and Datong River, the primary factor contributing to the alteration in runoff in the remaining nine rivers was the impact of runoff sensitivity coefficients. Human activities were the main reason for the change of runoff in other rivers except for the Shule River, Dang River, and Heihe River Basin. The findings contribute to grasping the response of streamflow alterations to the driving factors and offer a new insight to effectively understand the mechanism of runoff variation under the changing environments.",

      "abstract": "Methane is an important greenhouse gas 1 and its atmospheric concentration has almost tripled since pre-industrial times 2, 3, 4. Atmospheric methane mixing ratios vary seasonally, with the seasonal cycle amplitude (SCA) having decreased in northern high latitudes and increased in the subtropics and tropics since the 1980s 5, 6. These opposing SCA trends can help understanding of long-term changes in the global methane budget, as methane emissions and sinks have opposing effects on the SCA 5. However, trends in the methane SCA have not yet been explored in detail 5, 6. Here we use a suite of atmospheric transport model simulations and attribute the observed trends in the seasonal amplitude of methane to changes in emissions and the atmospheric sink from reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH). We find that the decreasing amplitude in the northern high latitudes is mainly caused by an increase in natural emissions (such as wetlands) owing to a warmer climate, adding evidence to previous studies suggesting a positive climate feedback 7, 8, 9. In contrast, the enhanced methane amplitude in the subtropics and tropics is mainly attributed to strengthened OH oxidation. Our results provide independent evidence for an increase in tropospheric OH concentration 10, 11 of 10±1% since 1984, which together with an increasing atmospheric methane concentration suggests a 21±1% increase in the atmospheric methane sink.",

      "abstract": "Evapotranspiration estimates for China derived from empirical and physical models exhibit limited agreement in magnitude and trends, due to the complexity of surface characteristics and climatic conditions. Advances in knowledge-guided data-driven methods allow hybrid models that integrate remote sensing-based ET algorithms with machine learning (ML) to mitigate these discrepancies effectively. We developed two hybrid models, ML_PM and ML_SEB, by coupling the Penman Monteith (PM) and surface energy balance (SEB) algorithm with three ML methods: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), and then simulated China’s ET from 2001 to 2022. The hybrid models ML_PM, ML_SEB, replaced empirical formulas of the critical but uncertain parameters: surface resistance (rs) and aerodynamic resistance (ra) with ML, respectively, considering energy balance and turbulent diffusion processes. Hybrid modeling enhanced the representation of physical processes while preserving high estimation accuracy. We evaluated the hybrid models using 63 eddy covariance (EC) sites across China and compared them with process-based physical models and pure ML. Results indicated that the hybrid models ML_PM and ML_SEB substantially improved the performance of the PM (NSE: 0.49) and SEB (NSE: −0.53), achieving NSE values of over 0.8 and 0.6, respectively. ML_PM, in particular, performed on par with pure ML overall and outperformed them for grassland and forest ecosystems, owing to its stronger physical foundation. Moreover, the hybrid models demonstrated greater robustness and generalization under sparse sampling and extreme events compared to pure ML. The optimal hybrid model (RF_PM) produced an annual mean ET of 580.33 ± 9.01 mm yr −1 for China over 2001-2022, with a statistically insignificant increasing trend (0.52 mm yr −2 , p > 0.05). Overall, hybrid modeling achieved an optimal balance between physical mechanism and estimation accuracy, offering a new perspective for ET estimation and enhancing our understanding of hydrological processes at regional and global scales under climate change.",

      "abstract": "Due to the scarcity of measured precipitation data in arid zones and the numerous factors affecting the uncertainty of precipitation data from multiple sources, understanding precipitation patterns is limited, and drought monitoring is constrained. Whereas water vapor content is closely related to precipitation, changes in water vapor can be an important indicator of drought development. Therefore, this paper takes Xinjiang as the study area, introduces precipitable water vapor, and constructs two new drought indices, the standardized and nonparametric standardized precipitable water indices (SPWI and NSPWI), using parametric and nonparametric kernel density estimation methods. Aiming at the drought characteristics of long duration and intensity in the study area, an identification method for long-duration and high-severity drought (LHD) events was proposed using the three-dimensional clustering method and the Copula function. The three-dimensional evolution characteristics and centroid migration patterns of LHD events were then analyzed.The results indicate that: (1) The newly constructed drought index can be used for drought monitoring in Xinjiang, and the performance of SPWI is better than that of NSPWI. (2) Based on the three-dimensional clustering method, which can better identify the drought events in the study region, it was found that the droughts were mostly concentrated in 1960-1987, and there was a trend from dry to wet. (3) The LHD events were identified based on the joint distribution probability of drought duration and severity greater than 75 %, and it was found that droughts originated in the southern and died out in the western part of the study region, that droughts were likely to be more frequent the deeper inland and farther away from the ocean, and that droughts lasted for longer periods and had a wider impact area; mountainous areas are more profoundly affected by the LHD events than plains and deserts areas. (4) LHD events have a wider centroid migration distance, and their drought development process is more complex, with spatial and temporal distributions. The drought index that introduces precipitable water vapor and the LHD event identification method proposed in this study can provide some guidance for the enhancement of drought prevention and mitigation capabilities in arid regions.",

The present study investigates interdecadal changes in Asian persistent drought characterized by the 24-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) under the influence of the AMO phase transitions. Distinct Asian persistent drought changes are found corresponding to the two AMO phase transitions. The first AMO phase transition around the late 1920s is accompanied by a change to a drier condition in most of eastern China and to a wetter condition in western Asia and northeastern Asia. The second AMO phase transition around the late 1990s is followed by a change to a drier condition in most of the mid-latitude Asia. Both precipitation and temperature changes contribute to the persistent drought changes with a larger role of precipitation. The distinct Asian persistent drought changes corresponding to the two AMO phase transitions are attributed to different atmospheric circulation anomaly patterns that induce different precipitation and temperature changes through modulating vertical motion, soil moisture and surface heat fluxes. The distinct atmospheric circulation changes during the two AMO phase transitions are induced by both different AMO-related sea surface temperature (SST) changes in the North Atlantic Ocean and the opposite Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) phase transition-related SST changes in the North Pacific Ocean. The present study highlights the necessity to distinguish the influences of individual AMO phase transitions and to consolidate the combined effects of the AMO and PDO phase transitions in addressing the interdecadal climate variability.",

      "abstract": "The boundary between land suitable for low rainfall grain cropping and the arid interior suitable for extensive grazing has a history in South Australia dating back to Goyder in the 1860s and in Western Australia to Brookman in the 1900s. Historical and future shifts in climatically determined edges of cropping regions focus discussion on how farmers might adapt to a changing climate. We integrate the outputs of climate analysis and crop simulation modelling to explore the limits to crop production at the low rainfall margin of cropping in Western Australia and South Australia. Across 40 locations, growing season (April to October) rainfall over the past two decades was 2-27% drier than the long-term record which corresponded to declines in simulated wheat yields. Increasing CO 2 levels, from 296ppm in 1900 to 412ppm in 2020, reduced but didn’t eliminate the decline in simulated yield. Climate models indicate that even stronger rainfall declines could be experienced in the future, particularly over the Western Australian cropping regions. We ran APSIM simulations with projected climate data from 8 global climate models GCMs for a subset of 8 representative low rainfall sites across the Western Australian and South Australian cropping region. The 8 GCMs provide a range in projected water limited wheat yields consistent with the range of projected changes in rainfall from different GCMs. We discussed the results with low rainfall farmers and advisers in the regions and provide an overview of their responses to aid our interpretation. Farmers maintained that they were continually adapting to season-to-season variation and to the changing climate. Most farmers felt that their current business model was working, and that climate change hadn’t forced them to make drastic changes. There was a belief that improved technologies (eg, new varieties) and agronomy had served them well in the past and would be able to keep pace with the effects of any climate change. Most of the changes over the last 30 years had been within cropping and grazing enterprises rather than changing enterprises to alternative land uses. The uptake of no-till farming was ranked as the largest change which enabled farmers to make better use of rainfall. Farmers had also changed varieties and adopted new crops. Participants accepted the importance of climate in the success of their cropping enterprises and that the climate was changing. However, there was a strong sense of technical optimism and a refusal to have their future defined by climate alone. Some farmers were concerned that transformation may be driven not directly by climate change, but rather by the policies associated with climate change.",

      "abstract": "Gross primary productivity plays a critical role in global carbon balance. However, quantifying the effects of different drivers still constitutes a challenge due to the different modeling techniques and data used. This study employs spatiotemporal analysis, machine learning, and statistical approaches to measure the significance of forest gross primary productivity drivers in China and its climate zones from 1990 to 2018. The results show that the annual average forest gross primary productivity in China was 914.74 gC m -2 y -1 during the study period and showed a significantly increasing trend ( p <0.01) at a rate of 4.09 gC m -2 y -1 . Forest gross primary productivity had a southeast-northwest downward spatiotemporal trend with significantly different distributions within the six climate zones, except in the arid and semi-arid zones. A Random Forest model did better than an eXtreme Gradient Boosting model when 10 explanatory variables were used. These variables included the novel forest fragmentation index and climate zones, which helped explain the effects of forest structure and climate characteristics of the climate zones better. The most important forest gross primary productivity drivers in China were mean annual temperature (26.2%), mean annual precipitation (18.6%), solar radiation (11%), forest fragmentation index (8.8%), and elevation (8.1%). Using Chatterjee’s correlation coefficient, this study provides, for each climate zone, its unique signature regarding the order and importance of the drivers of forest gross primary productivity. This study helps us understand what factors affect forest gross primary productivity in China and its climate zones better by showing how they work using machine learning. These findings may help China reach its carbon neutrality goals.",

      "abstract": "Rainfed agriculture, sustaining billions globally, faces escalating threats from climate change, yet the role of green water (soil moisture) in quantifying these risks remains critically understudied. We quantify green water scarcity (GWS)-insufficient rainfall to meet crop needs-under 1.5°C and 3°C warming, tracking shifts in risk categories (reliable, risky, highly risky) based on monthly water stress duration. At baseline (1996-2005), 25 % of global rainfed croplands (183 million hectares, Mha) are classified as reliable (≤1 month of GWS annually). However, with 1.5°C and 3°C of global warming, the risk of GWS increases noticeably, resulting in the loss of 70 Mha and 106 Mha of reliable rainfed croplands, respectively, shifting them into risky or highly risky categories. This degradation jeopardizes food production for 0.8 billion people at 1.5°C and 1.2 billion at 3°C, disproportionately impacting regions reliant on rainfed systems. Crucially, 3°C warming doubles the spatial extent of severe GWS compared to 1.5°C, underscoring the nonlinear rise in agricultural risks with temperature. Our analysis reveals that limiting warming to 1.5°C could preserve croplands that feed 400 million people, highlighting the urgent need for climate mitigation. These findings demand integrated water-resilient strategies-prioritizing soil moisture conservation, adaptive crop choices, and sustainable irrigation-to safeguard global food security. By bridging green water dynamics with climate targets, we provide a roadmap for stabilizing rainfed agriculture in a warming world.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms and propagation relationships between meteorological and groundwater droughts is crucial for producing early warnings of future hydrological droughts and groundwater management. However, scant research exists for mechanism of this unseen groundwater drought propagation. The drought characteristics and seasonal effects of meteorological drought and groundwater drought in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) were delved, based on the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Groundwater Drought Index (GDI). Considering the problem of traditional drought propagation methods is not comprehensive, the modified drought propagation method was proposed, from both linear and nonlinear perspectives concerning their relationship. The findings indicate varying degrees of declining trends in meteorological and groundwater drought ( slope = -0.0004/m, P < 0.01; slope = -0.0089/m, P < 0.01) in the YRB. The spatial distribution of worsening drought conditions is primarily concentrated in the central northern part of the YRB. However, groundwater drought has a larger affected area and a stronger declining trend. In terms of drought characteristics, meteorological and groundwater droughts have distinct seasonal patterns, but other characteristics show notable spatial heterogeneity. Meteorological droughts tend to occur early, have a high frequency, low intensity, and short duration. On the other hand, groundwater droughts exhibit opposite characteristics, occurring late, having a low frequency, high intensity, and long duration. The propagation time from meteorological drought to groundwater drought, calculated using linear and nonlinear methods, showed consistent seasonal effects, with the longest propagation time in winter and the shortest in summer. However, there are differences between the linear and nonlinear methods, with the linear method showing longer propagation times (12 months) compared to the shorter times in the nonlinear method (6 months). As for the characteristics of drought propagation, the modified drought propagation characteristic method proposed in this study demonstrates higher sensitivity and propagation rates compared to traditional single linear or nonlinear methods in the YRB. It compensates for the underestimation of traditional methods, providing better compensation and reducing uncertainty in the southern part of the YRB.",

VPD significantly affects regional and global climate systems by altering surface energy allocation. Under ongoing global warming, VPD is expected to increase continuously, amplifying its climatic impact. In this study, we systematically quantify the responses of ecosystem LE to VPD across different climatic zones using global eddy covariance observations and remote sensing-based modeling. The observational data reveal that LE decreases with rising VPD in arid regions, partly due to limited soil moisture, whereas LE increases in humid regions. Using an improved Remote Sensing-Penman Monteith (RS-PM) model, we estimate global LE from 1981 to 2022, and the modeled trends corroborate the observed spatial patterns: declining LE in arid regions and rising LE in humid zones. This finding corresponds with the divergent warming trends, with greater temperature increases in arid regions linked to a higher proportion of net radiation converted to sensible heat, thereby intensifying local warming. Our results comprehensively characterize the differential LE-VPD relationships under varying climatic conditions by integrating multi-source observations, advancing the understanding of local climate changes driven by LE. These findings are crucial for understanding the varying temperature trends between arid and humid regions.",

Numerous methods have been developed to estimate ET accurately and robustly across diverse scales. Many of these methods are constrained by reliance on remote sensing data, which is prone to gaps, or by the need for model calibration and training. This study evaluates the performance of the calibration-free surface flux equilibrium theory (SFET) for ET estimation at 33 Ameriflux sites in the continental USA. SFET-derived ET estimates are intercompared with widely used continental remote sensing products, including ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, and SSEBop. Results indicate that SFET consistently outperforms these ET products. SFET's performance is found to be better under wet conditions and clear skies, with reduced accuracy under arid and high evaporative stress conditions. Overall, SFET exhibits significant potential for providing accurate, continuous, long-term ET estimates, paving the way for operational application in uninstrumented regions over large scales.",

Research on cold events in NA has mainly focused on the individual impacts of the sea surface temperature (SST) variabilities in the North Pacific and the North Atlantic, with less analysis of their synergistic effect. Here we utilize observational data and numerical experiments to show that the positive North Pacific Victoria mode (VM) and the negative North Tropical Atlantic (NTA) SST exert significant synergistic effects on the winter-spring cold events in eastern NA via Rossby waves propagation. Specifically, the VM-related negative western North Pacific (WNP) SST anomalies are linked to upper-tropospheric wind convergence anomalies in situ, which excite a Rossby wave train from the WNP to the North Atlantic and thus strengthen the high-level negative geopotential height anomalies (GHAs) over eastern NA and the positive air-ocean feedback over the North Atlantic. As a result, the negative GHAs strengthened by the positive VM and negative NTA SST cause increased extreme cold events. Further results reveal that the negative GHAs and cold events in eastern NA during the co-occurrence of the positive VM and negative NTA SST events are more than three times stronger than those for the two kinds of single events. This study suggests that the synergistic effect of the positive VM and negative NTA SST anomalies could advance our comprehensive understanding of the combined effect of the inter-basin SST anomalies on the mid-to-high-latitude climate.",

      "abstract": "Without rapid emission reduction, it is increasingly likely that global temperatures will overshoot 1.5°C before carbon dioxide removal may help reverse warming. Such temperature overshoots affect the future hydrological cycle, with implications for land water availability. However, the hydrological response to such temperature overshoots is not well understood. Here, we investigate regional and seasonal changes of precipitation minus evaporation (P − E) in an ensemble of Earth system model simulations of temperature overshoot. Most climate models broadly show P − E reversibility after overshoot. However, models exhibiting an irreversible shift of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) during the temperature overshoot experience reduced wet-season and enhanced dry-season land water availability in tropical regions, which has long-lasting effects on the amplitude of P − E seasonality after the overshoot, constituting irreversible changes on human timescales. While some regions may experience alleviating seasonal hydrological conditions, others are subject to more intense seasonality. Half a century of CO 2 -stabilization after the temperature overshoot only halves the legacy effects of the overshoot on land water availability on over 23% of the world population in 12% of the global land area, covering regions of various hydrological regimes. Based on the model ensemble presented here, a strong irreversible shift of the ITCZ after an overshoot is a low-probability but high-impact outcome that would entail long-lasting hydrological changes with consequences for ecosystems and human societies.",

      "abstract": "Changes in vegetation have pronounced effects on water and carbon cycles. In the past few decades with significant warming, vegetation in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has become overall greening, particularly in its northeastern part. However, the effects of these changes on land-atmosphere water and carbon exchanges in the TP remain insufficiently understood. Here, we use a water-carbon coupled model, Penman-Monteith-Leuning Version 2, to quantify the direct impacts of vegetation change on evapotranspiration ( ET ) and gross primary production ( GPP ) in the Yellow River Source (YRS) region, a greening hotspot in the northeastern TP. We show that ET and GPP in the YRS increased significantly from 1982 to 2018, with trends of 1.72 ± 0.21 mm yr −2 and 3.96 ± 0.55 gC m −2 yr −2 (both p < 0.001), respectively. The change in leaf area index (LAI) was the dominant driver of GPP 's increase, contributing 79 %, followed by atmospheric CO 2 concentration and the climatic factors. However, vegetation greening had a limited impact (11 %) on ET since the increases in plant transpiration ( E c ) and canopy evaporation ( E i ) were largely offset by the decline in soil evaporation ( E s ). Instead, the climatic factors contributed most (72 %) to ET change over the past 37 years. Nevertheless, vegetation changes played a key role in altering ET components, with LAI contributing nearly 40 % to trends in E s and E c , and over 70 % to the E i trend over the past 37 years. Our results highlight the distinct roles that vegetation plays in regulating land-atmosphere water and carbon exchanges at high altitudes.",

      "abstract": "Increasing compound dry and hot events (CDHEs) have become a leading risk to regional and global crop production. While numerous accounts of crop growth or yield response to climate extremes exist, impacts of CDHEs on crop yield are not well quantified, especially for that associated with large-scale modes of climate variabilities. Here we address this issue by using statistical maize yield data over China with a special focus on the impact of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We find that over 1961-2020, CDHEs led to significant yield reduction by 4 %, while it was aggravated to 6 % by the concurrent ENSO. Mechanisms for this underscored the role of ENSO in modulating CDHE characteristics wherein land-atmosphere feedbacks significantly contributed to yield loss. Compared to early stage of growth, ENSO in conjunction with compound events triggered more substantial maize yield losses during the late stage. Furthermore, this amplified risk was observed to intensify in recent decades. Note that agronomic practices, like irrigation, could significantly offset these negative impacts on maize yield. These findings highlight the great threat of CDHEs to maize yield as well as the key role of ENSO in driving this process, and may offer insights for yield prediction and agricultural management.",

However, current research faces challenges in improving the accuracy of identifying ecological drought events, enhancing temporal resolution, and refining model fitting for resilience quantification. In this study, a novel, daily-scale Ecosystem Service Supply (ESS) index is introduced, integrating water yield, carbon storage, and habitat quality into a unified measure weighted by ecosystem service equivalency factors. Baiyangdian wetland in North China was chosen as the study area, where the ESS index and the Standardized Ecological Water Deficit Index (SEWDI) were combined to jointly identify ecological drought events that directly alter ecosystem functioning. To characterize post-drought recovery dynamics, Bayesian non-parametric quantile regression model is employed to construct resilience curves, which capture the relationship between drought intensity and ecosystem recovery time at multiple quantiles. The results reveal that forests exhibit greater resilience under mild drought conditions, while grasslands demonstrate superior recovery capacity during more severe droughts. Due to differences in ecosystem structure and vegetation characteristics, forest ecosystems experience a significant decline in resilience under extreme drought conditions. In contrast, grassland ecosystems generally maintain stable or even slightly improved recovery resilience. By improving the temporal resolution of ecosystem assessments and introducing a flexible method to quantify resilience trajectories, this approach offers valuable insights for evaluating drought resilience and guiding ecosystem management in water-limited environments.",

Accurate prediction of future meteorological to agricultural drought propagation is essential for developing early warning systems and managing agricultural water resources. However, the thresholds at which meteorological drought induce agricultural drought remains unclear. In this study, a drought propagation threshold framework based on a Copula-Bayesian model was developed to estimate the propagation time, probability, and triggering thresholds of meteorological drought to agricultural drought in China under future scenarios. The results indicated that meteorological and agricultural drought indices were projected to exhibit declining trends in the future, suggesting the intensification of drought severity across China. The drought propagation time was expected to shorten by 1.6-3 months in the future. Furthermore, the conditional probability for the propagation of meteorological droughts of varying severity to agricultural droughts was projected to increase by 10.9-26.4 %. Southern China (SC) and the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) regions emerged as high-risk regions for drought propagation, where average conditional probabilities were 57.2-65.1 % and 49.1-57.4 %, respectively. The drought propagation thresholds were projected to increase in the future, indicating heightened vulnerability of agricultural droughts to meteorological droughts. The triggering thresholds for drought in SC (−0.99 to −0.87) and YRB (−1.20 to −0.94) were relatively high, where even mild meteorological droughts would induce moderate agricultural droughts in the future. By contrast, the predicted trigger thresholds were relatively low for the Northeast China Plain (−1.92 to −1.65) and North China Plain (−1.69 to −1.50). Across China, temperature emerged as the primary driver of changes in trigger thresholds, with its relative contribution estimated to be 43.1-47.2 %. Climate warming was projected to increase the future trigger thresholds in China. The findings assist policymakers in formulating effective agricultural management strategies to address future agricultural drought risks.",

In this study, the GMM clustering method was used to calculate the posterior probability values for each unit, which utilised the 1 km×1 km grid of the Ziya River Basin as the calculating unit and selected indicators related to the underlying surface characteristics, human activities, and hydrological and ecological features. The weights of each indicator are as follows: elevation 0.263, slope 0.218, precipitation 0.053, temperature 0.048, relative humidity 0.055, runoff 0.224, vegetation normalised index 0.030, and gross domestic product per capita, 0.108. By calculating the posterior probability, the basin is divided into 5 ecohydrological regions. The zoning results reflect the similarities and differences in the ecohydrological situation of the basin. After the Kruskal-Wallis testing and analysis, all eigenvalues were p = 0.000<0.05, indicating that the eight indicators were not the same for each type of distribution. This study provides a minimum management unit for basin water resource management departments, conserves resources, and improves social benefits.",

In China, characterized by uneven water resource distribution and regional water scarcity, understanding moisture recycling dynamics is crucial for sustainable water management. Our study quantified the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation and water availability across China and its sub-regions during 2000-2022 using an atmospheric moisture tracking model. Results revealed that 59% of China's evapotranspiration (ET) was recycled within the region, contributing 299 mm/year to precipitation and 98 mm/year to water availability. Distinct spatial patterns emerged, with the highest ET contribution to precipitation and water availability in subtropical Central and South China (477 mm/year precipitation; 210 mm/year water availability) and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (355 mm/year precipitation; 121 mm/year water availability). Water availability exchanges through moisture transport between sub-regions were quantified, with Northeast China and subtropical Central and South China being net water availability recipients of 31 and 67 billion m 3 /year, respectively. The remaining sub-regions were net exporters, with tropical South China and Northwest China experiencing the largest net exports, amounting to −40 and −30 billion m 3 /year, respectively. The study not only advances our understanding of the hydrological dynamics in China but also offers critical insights for sustainable water management practices aimed at mitigating challenges posed by water scarcity and climate change. It highlights the significance of integrating moisture recycling considerations into water resource management strategies to enhance resilience against hydroclimatic variabilities.",

Given this, a more refined and comprehensive analysis of DFAA events in China can provide valuable insights for global mitigation efforts. This study examines the frequency, intensity, and coverage of DFAA events during the historical periods (HIS, 1961-2014) and under future climate projections based on Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs: SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585, 2015-2100) using a daily-scale determination method. The results revealed that regions with frequent DFAA events also experience higher intensity and broader impact areas. Compared to HIS, DFAA event frequency, intensity, and coverage increased by 31 %, 3 %, and 37 % under SSPs, reaching 7.31 events/year, 1.069, and 0.422 %. Across both HIS and SSPs, the proportions of light (75 %-78 %), moderate (18 %-21 %), and severe (4 %-5 %) DFAA events remained relatively stable. YGP, HHHP, MLYP, NCP, and NASR are the five hotspot areas. Analysis attributes 45 % (P < 0.05) of DFAA frequency variability to drought and flood frequency (74.45 %) and duration (25.55 %). Furthermore, low to medium emission scenarios show significant potential to reduce DFAA occurrence, offering direction to mitigate the impacts of global warming, particularly as mid-latitude regions have emerged as DFAA hotspots over the past 30 years. These findings provide critical insights for countries addressing climate change and ensuring food security.",

      "abstract": "Precipitation is projected to increase in response to human-induced global warming over global monsoon region, with significant implications for water resources in these densely populated areas. While most climate models agree on the externally forced wetting signal in global monsoon precipitation (GMP), the chaotic nature of internal variability introduces substantial uncertainty in future projections, particularly in the near term. In this study, we utilize multi-model simulations and four sets of large-ensemble simulations to investigate the role of internal variability, particularly the interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), in influencing uncertainty in future monsoon precipitation changes. We find that the externally forced wetting trend in GMP surpasses the range of internal variability only after the 2040s under both the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. Prior to this, internal variability contributes over 40% of the uncertainty in GMP projections, with the IPO accounting for nearly half of this internally induced uncertainty. To inform adaptation and mitigation efforts, we further propose near-term storylines of monsoon precipitation changes at both global and regional scales. Specifically, a transition from a negative to a positive phase of the IPO at a rate of +1 SD per decade during 2021-2040 leads to a decrease in GMP by -0.41% (-0.23%) per decade relative to 1995-2014 under the SSP2-4.5 (SSP5-8.5) scenario, while the reverse transition leads to an increase of 1.35% (1.53%) per decade. These findings underscore the need to account for the impacts of the IPO in near-term climate change planning for monsoon-affected regions.",

      "abstract": "Globally, 2023 was the hottest year on record and saw the development of a strong El Niño with widespread impacts. This El Niño event was unusual for its strong oceanic warming yet muted Southern Oscillation and wind anomalies over the tropical Pacific. This discrepancy is perplexing given the historically close coupling of El Niño and the Southern Oscillation. Atmospheric model experiments show that warming in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans in 2023 and the slow background sea surface temperature trend reduced the surface wind response over the tropical Pacific by modulating the Walker circulation. We develop a hindcast system that reproduces 87% of the June-December El Niño warming even without wind stress feedback after April 2023. The intense oceanic warming was primarily driven by the strong build-up of western Pacific heat content during the preceding prolonged La Niña. This indicates that the 2023-2024 El Niño primarily arose from oceanic processes, independent of the classic positive Bjerknes feedback mechanism. Due to the strong ocean memory, this event was highly predictable at long time leads. Climate model simulations suggest that such 2023-like El Niños may become more frequent in a warming climate.",

      "abstract": "Understanding and predicting heatwave risk is a societal imperative in the face of climate change. Anthropogenic aerosol emissions impact heat extremes more strongly per unit of mean warming than do greenhouse gases, but the influence of aerosols' evolving spatial pattern on time-varying heatwave hazard and resulting population exposure have been largely ignored. Aerosols' spatially heterogeneous forcing is often co-located with population centers due to aerosols' industrial sources and short atmospheric lifetime, potentially resulting in amplified exposure to aerosol-driven climate effects. Here, we quantify the influence of historical and projected future changes in aerosol emissions through 2100 on global patterns of heatwave hazard (i.e. the frequency of heatwave days) and exposure (i.e. population-weighted hazard) using the NCAR Community Earth System Model v1 single forcing large ensemble. Our results show that increased aerosol emissions since 1920 have suppressed heatwave frequency over populated regions by roughly half through present-day---a trend that is now reversing with shifting emission patterns and net global declining emissions. This may already be leading to an aerosol-driven acceleration in heatwave frequency, a signal that is amplified in populated regions. Aerosols' influence on heatwaves is strongly co-located with population, creating out-sized exposure, which evolves through time with aerosols' evolving emissions pattern within this large ensemble. Our results suggest that near-term changes in aerosol emissions will be a disproportionate driver of trends in heatwave exposure, meriting dedicated future study, and that aerosols' evolving spatial pattern should be considered in attempts to attribute recent heatwave trends to human activity.",

      "abstract": "Both ground surface temperature (Ts) and near-surface air temperature (T2m) in summer over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are not only a critical control of the cryosphere, but also an important indicator of atmospheric heat sources, which have a significant impact on regional water resources and broader climate systems. However, their characteristics and mechanisms have not been systematically studied. Based on gridded observations and ERA5 reanalysis we use diagnostic methods such as surface energy budget, longwave radiation decomposition, and water vapor budget, to analyze the characteristics and mechanisms of summer Ts and T2m changes over the monsoon and westerly regions of the TP during 1961-2022, as well as the possible impact of atmospheric circulation on the changes. Summer Ts (T2m) over the TP has increased at a rate of 0.20 (0.29) °C/decade, with rates of 0.21 (0.31) and 0.19 (0.28) °C/decade in the monsoon and westerly regions, respectively. For summer Ts warming, the increase in downward longwave radiation caused by an increase in water vapor is the primary contributor, and snow-albedo feedback is the secondary contributor. The former accounts for 58.3 %/62.3 % of the warming in the monsoon/westerly regions, and the corresponding proportions for the latter are 31.3 %/15.1 %, respectively. These surface-based local processes also contribute to T2m warming through the regulation of surface turbulent fluxes. Besides, atmospheric circulation changes (mainly manifested as the weakening of westerly winds) have not only increased water vapor, but also enhanced anomalous warm advection near the surface, resulting in an extra T2m warming over the TP. This study shows that local feedback and atmospheric circulation are controlling the summer warming over the TP, in both monsoon and westerly regions.",

      "abstract": "Understanding precipitation extremes response to CO2 removal (CDR) in China is crucial for climate change mitigation and adaptation. This study examines the responses of heavy precipitation, represented by the maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation (Rx5day), over China under an idealized CDR scenario using five models from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP6). The results reveal an asymmetric response, indicating that China may experience more severe heavy precipitation events compared to the pre-industrial (PI, 1850-1900) period, even if CO2 concentrations are reduced to PI levels. From June to September, the increase in Rx5day across most of China relative to the PI stage is primarily driven by upward air motions and the convergence of water vapor flux. The regions with overshoot are linked to southward movement of westerly jet, as well as shifts in vertical motion. A moisture budget diagnosis demonstrates that the thermal term plays a dominant role in promoting water vapor convergence across most of China, while the dynamic term leads to water vapor divergence in specific areas. These results in corresponding increases and decreases in extreme precipitation, respectively. Specifically, water vapor advection associated with the thermal term, along with the convergence and divergence linked to the dynamic term, serves as the principal determinants influencing the distribution of water vapor changes in China from June to September. Our study highlights the need for further investigation into more effective mitigation and adaptation strategies in the context of CDR.",

      "abstract": "Precisely assessing wetland net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is important for accurately evaluating global carbon budgets. However, constrained by the quality of observational data and insufficient understanding of driving mechanisms, assessments of China's wetland NEP still have considerable uncertainties. Therefore, this study assessed continuous observations from 30 eddy covariance flux towers across various wetland types in China and applied the random forest (RF) model to simulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of China's wetland NEP. The results showed that from 1982 to 2020, China's wetlands represented a net C-CO 2 sink overall, with an average NEP of 21.61±0.04 mg C m -2 h -1 and annual net C-CO 2 absorption of 56.23 Tg C. Riverine and coastal wetlands had the highest NEP, while freshwater marshes had the lowest. From 1982 to 2020, the wetland NEP in China exhibited a significant increasing trend. Further analysis indicated that potential evapotranspiration (PET) is the main driving factor behind the significant increase in NEP in China's wetlands, with a clear threshold effect: NEP rises with PET up to a certain point (e.g., 160 mm), after which it declines. This study accurately quantified the spatiotemporal dynamics of China's wetland NEP and revealed the critical impact of PET on NEP, thus providing a new perspective for performing wetland carbon cycle research and formulating climate change mitigation strategies.",

This paper develops a two-layer complex network to exploit climatological characteristics on the links between moisture transport and EPEs in China. Specifically, focusing on the period from 1948 to 2021, the links from moisture transport to EPEs by month are tracked by event synchronization and characterized by network topology. The results show that there exist in total five communities of the links, showing different associations with the East Asian Monsoon. Specifically, in southern and eastern China, the links strengthen in March and peak in August; in the Loess Plateau of China, the links fluctuate during the alternation of prevailing winds; in northeastern China, the links peak in July with fluctuations in May and November; in the southern Tibetan Plateau, the links strengthen before the alternation of prevailing winds; and in northwestern China, the links weaken during the East Asian Summer Monsoon stage. In southern and eastern China, the links point to three pathways of moisture transport contributing to EPEs from the Indian Ocean, western Pacific and South Asia within 8 days. In the meantime, it is observed that tropical cyclones influence about 50% of the links during July and August and that atmospheric rivers account for 40% of the links in June, July and August. Overall, the climatological characteristics provide useful information on the dynamics of moisture transport and EPEs in China.",

This enhancement persists despite regional differences in atmospheric circulation fields associated with precipitation events. Upon limiting dynamic variations, the enhancement of upper-level precipitation rates by smoke aerosols remained evident. Generally, wildfire emissions were estimated to augment the global mean annual Aerosol Optical Depth by 0.0358, with a variation of 0.56%, and to lower the mean annual global precipitation top temperature by 0.32 C, with a variation of 3%. It suggests that on the global stage, smoke aerosol acts as an effective cloud condensation and ice nucleating agent, diminishing cloud particle sizes at the lower layer, facilitating the formation of ice-phase hydrometeors, and triggering augmented latent heat release at the upper layer, which delay the rain formation from low to high altitude, and enhance the upper-level rain intensity and elevate precipitation tops.",

However, the impacts and mechanisms of these contributors to extreme precipitation changes compared with mean changes still need to be investigated. Here, we used the moisture budget equation to decompose precipitation changes into three primary contributing factors (evapotranspiration, atmospheric mean circulation, and water vapor) based on CMIP6-LUMIP experiments. A global reduction in mean precipitation due to LULCCs can be attributed to relatively equal contributions of changes in evapotranspiration and atmospheric mean circulation over the historical (1995-2014) and future (2080-2099) periods. In contrast, during the top drying month, the precipitation reduction is approximately 2-3 times greater than the multi-year mean change. The dynamic contributor representing the mean circulation change surpasses evapotranspiration as the primary contributor driving the extreme precipitation decrease in the majority of the landscape. The socioeconomic impacts of LULCCs-induced extreme precipitation changes are greater than those of the mean state, especially in the future.",

We demonstrate that ENSO exerts strongly season-dependent impacts on WPD in subregions, spanning the ENSO-developing summer to the decaying summer. During these active ENSO phases, 15%-50% of stations within that regions exhibit WPD anomalies exceeding ±10% relative to their seasonal climatology in response to a 1°C sea surface temperature change in the central-eastern Pacific during the ENSO peak winter.

In the 2019 and 2022 droughts, stomatal closure in the Yangtze River Basin, caused by soil moisture deficits, led to ∼60% reductions in ozone deposition rates to vegetation, aligning with reduced photosynthesis inferred from satellite remote sensing of solar induced fluorescence. Ozone production increased due to higher isoprene emissions from heat stress, NO x -rich airflow from North China, and enhanced solar radiation. Soil drought intensified temperatures and increased isoprene emissions by 27%, but these only had marginal impact on ozone (<5 ppbv) in South China, where ozone formation is NO x -limited. Reduced ozone uptake by drought-stressed vegetation played a dominant role, driving 10-20 ppbv increases in daily maximum 8-hr average ozone concentrations and a threefold rise in events exceeding 100 ppbv.",

      "abstract": "The upward trend in regional precipitation intensity is evident in China for the past six decades. However, the extent to which local urbanization around the observational stations contributes to this trend remains unclear. This study examines the impact of urbanization on, and its contribution to, the trends in precipitation indices as estimated based on daily precipitation data of national stations across China mainland during 1960-2018. Our analysis reveals that the urbanization signal is detectable in the estimated trend of regional mean precipitation indices. Specially, the urbanization effect accounts for at least 10% of the long-term increase in annual total precipitation, with a more substantial contribution to the increase (decrease) in precipitation intensity (frequency). The pronounced urbanization effect is observed during the warm season, which accounts for at least 16% of the increasing summer intensity. Spatially, the precipitation increase is significantly affected by urbanization over eastern China, and urbanization also intensifies the upward trend of the three precipitation indices over the southeastern portion, though it decreases the observed frequency overall in China mainland. Urbanization induces an asymmetric change from light toward heavy precipitation, particularly in southeastern China, while it causes the precipitation intensities in most quantile ranks to increase. Thus, the spatial-temporal pattern of observed precipitation frequency change contains a significant urbanization signal. These findings indicate that the observed precipitation change in China mainland, characterized by increased amount and intensity but decreased frequency, could be explained at least partially by urbanization around the meteorological stations. It implies that the large-scale change in precipitation observed based on station data in the country may not solely be a regional response to anthropogenic global warming.",

      "abstract": "The sensitivity of vegetation productivity to precipitation ( S ppt ) is crucial for grasping how vegetation responds to changing precipitation and forecasting future shifts in ecosystem function. However, comprehensive assessment of S ppt globally is limited by specific technical defects or objective limitations, leading to a poor understanding of its spatial distribution and temporal variations. In this study, we examined the spatial patterns and temporal changes o.ff S ppt across global terrestrial ecosystems from 2001 to 2021 using a change-based method and various satellite observations, including solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI). Additionally, we obtained various high-resolution global datasets and applied extreme gradient boosting ( XGBoost ) along with SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to explain how key climatic, topographic, edaphic, and vegetation variables regulate S ppt . Spatially, S ppt exhibited positive values in most regions, particularly in arid areas, while lower values were found in mesic regions. Temporally, S ppt shifted from a declining to an increasing trend in most regions over the past two decades, with the breakpoint occurring primarily between 2011 and 2015. This shift could be related to the fertilization effect of elevated CO 2 , intensified drought caused by increased vapor pressure deficit, and atmospheric nitrogen deposition. In forest ecosystems, radiation, temperature, and soil nutrients were found to be critical in regulating S ppt , whereas leaf functional traits demonstrated relatively greater importance in grasslands and shrublands. Negative regulatory relationships were shown to exist between land slope and forest age with S ppt . Overall, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive vegetation productivity in the context of changing precipitation patterns.",

      "abstract": "Understanding recent large-scale drought patterns and the mechanisms producing extreme drought events is vital for future drought forecasts and understanding future drought risks. Increasingly, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) has been used as an important measure of evaporative demand and proxy for drought detection. In this study, VPD is used to calculate the new Standardized VPD Drought Index (SVDI) with NASA North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) data. Previous studies have shown that SVDI accurately identifies the timing and magnitude short-term droughts in the United States (U.S). In the present study, SVDI is now used to identify large-scale drought patterns between 1980 and 2021 and drought variability driven by selected global teleconnections originating in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Spatial drought characteristics were extracted from SVDI using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. Then a k-means clustering algorithm was applied to both EOF principal components and primary teleconnections, including the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) to identify drought events driven by the Pacific Ocean. Results show that the SVDI is useful in evaluating large-scale drought variability in the U.S. related to global teleconnections, and that mechanisms influencing summer drought patterns in the Western and Southwestern U.S. are driven by a tropical-extratropical interactions originating in the equatorial Pacific Ocean related to ENSO dynamics with interdecadal variability modulated by PDO. The large-scale droughts in the Central and Southern U.S., like those in 2011 and 2012, on the other hand, are driven by the North Pacific Ocean warm pool during a strong negative PDO, which subsequently influenced variability in the Bermuda-Azores High in the Atlantic Ocean. In summer 2011, the Bermuda-Azores High weakened, reducing the onshore winds and moisture transport along the eastern Gulf of Mexico and contributing to ongoing drought in the region. The Northern Pacific and Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) have increased between 1980 and 2021. As SSTs continue to rise in the Northern Pacific Ocean, one consequence of the coupled North Pacific warm pool and atmospheric dynamics, is to increase summer drought variability over a large region in the southern and midwestern U.S. under global warming.",

This study therefore focuses on the impact of precipitation on daily maximum temperature ( T max ) and daily minimum temperature ( T min ) across China's climatic regions from 1952 to 2019. Results show that precipitation-induced cooling effects on T max through cloud effects and evaporative cooling, particularly in arid and semi-humid regions. In arid regions, precipitation enhances T min through increased downward longwave radiation and changes in soil thermodynamics, while in humid regions, rainfall-induced evaporative cooling suppresses T min . Notably, the T max warming trend during rainy weathers lacks statistical significance in humid regions, and T min consistently warms more during dry conditions. These findings reveal a saturation effect of precipitation on temperature and provide a framework for understanding precipitation-temperature interactions, with implications for refining climate model and assessing global warming.",

While Earth System Models generally project a more positive NAO under 21st century high-emission scenarios, uncertainties persist as to the precise response of the NAO to increased CO 2 levels, owing to large internal variability. In this study we investigate the response of the NAO to a wide range of CO 2 forcings, from two to eight times the preindustrial values. Analyzing a large sample of present-generation climate models, we find that the NAO likely becomes more positive with increasing CO 2 concentrations. Moreover, we find a reduction in NAO variability. This leads to a smaller increase in the likelihood of extremely positive NAO events than would be expected based solely on the shift in the mean. On the other hand, we also find a reduction in extremely negative NAO events, which is attributable to both the shift toward more positive values and the decrease in variance. Finally, our analysis reveals that the distribution of the NAO response at high CO 2 forcing is negatively skewed. This fact partially offsets the decrease in extremely positive NAO events associated with reduced variability. Ultimately, our results suggest a greater increase in positive NAO events compared to the decrease in extremely negative NAO events at higher CO 2 forcing.",

However, while the impacts of increased greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations are highlighted in existing studies, the contribution of reduced anthropogenic aerosol (AA) emissions is likely to be overlooked. Here, utilizing single-forcing projections under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, we elucidate the fingerprints of GHG and AA forcings on future P-E evolution. We reveal that future P-E changes are primarily driven by changes during the wet season, with contrasting trends between the Asian-African and American monsoon domains. The escalation of GHG concentrations is projected to increase P-E over Asian-African monsoon domains while decreasing it over the American monsoon domains. Conversely, aerosol reductions will drive a transition from current widespread drying to future wetting, with contributions comparable to GHG forcing over the Asian-African monsoon domains. While GHG increases and AA reductions can elevate atmospheric moistening through radiative warming, the disparate P-E responses arise from dynamic processes that favor drying trends in the American monsoon domains under GHG forcing. In contrast, strengthened monsoon circulations contribute to a wetting trend in the Asian-African monsoon domains under AA reductions, attributable to greater interhemispheric thermal contrast. Our findings highlight the importance of considering aerosol mitigation in climate risk assessments for densely populated monsoon regions.",

In this context, we examined the effects of climate variability on productive and environmental dimensions in Iguatu (Ceará), a representative municipality of the Brazilian semiarid region, over a 37-year period (1985-2023). Our results confirm the intensification of droughts, reduction in water bodies, and decline in agricultural production, contributing to rural exodus and unregulated urban growth. In contrast, livestock farming, particularly cattle and sheep, expanded significantly, increasing pasture areas to 42 % of the municipality by 2023. The lack of significant correlation between most agricultural production series and climate descriptors may indicate the role of factors including irrigation, government subsidies, and management practices, which enhance production resilience to climate variability. Meanwhile, forest cover was severely reduced and heavily fragmented. Our findings underscore the critical environmental degradation in the region and emphasize the importance of integrated strategies to mitigate climate change impacts. We recommend reforestation on rural properties combined with sustainable agricultural practices, such as intensive livestock farming, pasture rotation and fallow periods, reduction in slaughter age, and crop-livestock-forest integration. These measures have the potential to strengthen the resilience of the Brazilian semiarid region, promoting natural resource conservation and supporting local economic sustainability.",

      "abstract": "Assessing evapotranspiration (ET) responses to droughts is of great significance for understanding the exchanges of water, carbon, and energy in a changing environment. However, the interannual variation (IAV) of ET and its environmental controls under different drought types in China’s boreal forests remain poorly understood. In this study, we integrated eight years of eddy covariance measurements and environmental observations during growing seasons to evaluate the IAV of ET and the control mechanisms of ET under no drought, atmospheric drought, soil drought, and combined drought conditions. Over the study period, the IAV of ET was relatively small with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 8.6%, whereas the evapotranspiration/precipitation (ET/P) ratio exhibited a great fluctuation with a CV of 24.6%, corresponding to the higher variability in P (CV of 31.2%). Atmospheric drought significantly increased ET by 18.05% than no drought condition, whereas soil drought significantly reduced ET by 19.02%. However, ET showed no significant difference between no drought and combined drought due to the constraint role of low soil water content (SWC) in high atmospheric demand during the combined drought. The indirect and direct driving effects of atmospheric conditions, such as net radiation (Rn), air temperature (Ta), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were the key to ET responses to different drought types. Furthermore, precipitation rather than energy demand or canopy greenness had a greater impact on the IAV of ET. Interestingly, the precipitation regime with larger rainfall events (> 15 mm/day) was mostly related to the IAV of ET. These findings enhance our understanding of the responses of ET to multiple drought types and the intricate relationship between ET and P, highlighting that precipitation patterns due to climate change could potentially increase the complexity of environmental control on ET variations in boreal forests.",

However, the impact of changing snow dynamics on drought propagation time (tP) has rarely been assessed. Utilizing observed streamflow and reanalyzed climate data from ∼900 northern snow-affected catchments, here we provide a comprehensive investigation on temporal changes in tP and underlying mechanisms in the context of diminishing snow. Results show that catchments with a higher fraction of precipitation falling as snow (fs) exhibit a longer tP compared to catchments with marginal snowfall. Over the past 70 years, tP has significantly decreased following decreased fs, indicating accelerated drought propagation in a snow-diminishing world. Specifically, for catchments with lower mean annual fs (\n \n⩽ 30%), tP is decreasing at a rate of −0.8 d per decade. In contrast, for catchments with higher \n \n (\n \n> 50%), tP is decreasing at a rate of −3.4 d per decade, four times faster than the rate observed in low-\n \n catchments. This acceleration is attributed to a reduced total snowmelt and slower snowmelt rate during the drought propagation process, which decreases streamflow recharge from snowmelt and increases evaporation losses.

      "abstract": "Ongoing climate change is modifying snow dynamics, further altering streamflow ( Q ) in cold regions. Despite extensive research over the past decades, the impact of changes in snow on mean annual Q remains debated, and the underlying mechanisms driving these responses are still unclear. In this study, we employ the Budyko framework to establish multivariate relationships between a Budyko model parameter and several variables, including snowfall fraction ( f s ), across 931 carefully selected snow-influenced catchments in the Northern Hemisphere. Our results show that the average elasticity of Q to f s across all catchments is 0.13. However, mean annual Q responses vary among catchments, with 78% of catchments experiencing decreased Q and others exhibiting increased Q with declining f s . These variations are manifested in decreased warm-season Q and increased cold-season Q , respectively. Additionally, attribution analysis of Q change highlights a critical role of f s changes as a second-order control on Q after precipitation. Examining possible mechanisms behind the varying Q responses reveal that the influence of f s on snowmelt intensity and snow season available energy is more pronounced in catchments exhibiting positive Q feedback to f s . In contrast, its impact on rainfall intensity and the asynchrony between available energy and liquid water input is greater in catchments displaying negative Q feedback to f s . Our findings enhance the understanding of Q responses to changing f s and provide valuable insights for water resource management in snow-influenced regions in a warming climate.",

Owing to the complexity of the climate system, the variability in US winter (DJF) precipitation response to ENSO is investigated. By regressing autoencoder neural network-based ENSO types (i.e., encoded tropical Pacific Sea surface temperature anomaly patterns) onto DJF US precipitation, supplemented with support vector regression and extreme gradient-boosting regression, we show that ENSO modulation of precipitation is regionally sensitive to the ENSO type. Certain regions exhibit significant nonlinear relationships between precipitation and strong ENSO event phase that was most pronounced over the eastern and northwestern quadrants of the US. The coherency of the response varies among individual events. Specifically, among individual events, differences in ENSO SST anomaly patterns were linked to meridional shifts in the positioning of the Pacific jet stream. This leads to variable anomalous upper-level flow and atmospheric conditions influencing US winter precipitation during the ENSO events. By analyzing associations between DJF precipitation and ENSO types whilst assessing the consistency of precipitation anomalies during strong ENSO events, we identify the regional likelihood of consistent precipitation responses, thereby calibrating confidence in seasonal ENSO-precipitation responses.",

      "abstract": "California faces cycles of drought and flooding that are projected to intensify, but these extremes may impact water users across the state differently due to the region's natural hydroclimate variability and complex institutional framework governing water deliveries. To assess these risks, this study introduces a novel exploratory modeling framework informed by paleo and climate-change based scenarios to better understand how impacts propagate through the Central Valley's complex water system. A stochastic weather generator, conditioned on tree-ring data, produces a large ensemble of daily weather sequences conditioned on drought and flood conditions under the Late Renaissance Megadrought period (1550-1580 CE). Regional climate changes are applied to this weather data and drive hydrologic projections for the Sacramento, San Joaquin, and Tulare Basins. The resulting streamflow ensembles are used in an exploratory stress test using the California Food-Energy-Water System model, a highly resolved, daily model of water storage and conveyance throughout California's Central Valley. Results show that megadrought conditions lead to unprecedented reductions in inflows and storage at major California reservoirs. Both junior and senior water rights holders experience multi-year periods of curtailed water deliveries and complete drawdowns of groundwater assets. When megadrought dynamics are combined with climate change, risks for unprecedented depletion of reservoir storage and sustained curtailment of water deliveries across multiple years increase. Asymmetries in risk emerge depending on water source, rights, and access to groundwater banks.",

This leads to prolonged droughts and excessive heat events, increasing vulnerability of cities to water scarcity and extreme heat. Here, we integrate data from regional climate simulations into an urban modeling approach that operates at an intraurban microscale. Using this approach, we investigate the concurrent effects of the 2019 European summer drought and an increase in extreme heat days under RCP2.6 (mitigation scenario) and RCP8.5 (business-as-usual scenario) on land-atmosphere interactions, evaporative cooling potential, and bioclimatic conditions in Innsbruck, Austria. Results indicate that water-limiting conditions such as those from summer 2019 impair evaporative capacities of ecological systems and augment diurnal and nocturnal heat transfer between the soil, surface and atmosphere in the city, if not irrigated extensively. Combined with the projected increase in daily maximum temperature of extreme heat days by 3.9 K under RCP8.5, we see the development of extreme human heat stress, with a mean Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) exceeding 38°C across the study area. Additionally, we found that maintaining a prevailing evaporative cooling effect over an area requires a degree of surface sealing less than 11% and unrestricted water supply. We stress the urgency of integrated urban water management, including combined rain and greywater recycling, and innovative natural and technical climate change interventions for urban green space irrigation. These mitigation measures are necessary to avoid critical malfunctions in ecological systems related to human well-being under future climate trajectories.",

This study focused on the Eastern Mediterranean and explored the impact of heatwave characteristics on cardiovascular (CVD) mortality in three typical sites (Athens, Thessaloniki and Cyprus). We demonstrated that the heatwave order and timing in the season, as well as the intensity and evolution, may determine the exposure-response relationship. Specifically, heatwave days occurring during the 1st heatwave were associated with a higher increase in CVD mortality risk compared to heatwave days of the 2nd and 3rd (or subsequent) event (e.g. for Athens: 28.3 %, 95%CI: 23.2 %, 33.6 % for 1st event; 17.0 %, 95% CI: 9.8 %, 24.7 % for 2nd event), while hotter heatwave days also amplified the health impact (increase in CVD risk per °C above the site-specific heatwave threshold for Athens: 11.79 %, 95%CI: 9.80 %, 13.79 %; for Thessaloniki: 18.44 %, 95 % 13.81 %, 23.13 %; for Cyprus: 36.14 %, 95% CI: 23.95 %, 49.14%). Heatwave days lagging from the onset of the event resulted in increased CVD mortality risk (e.g. for Athens: 7.96 %, 95%CI: 1.04 %, 15.02 % for the 1st heatwave day; 36.31 %, 95% CI; 27.59 %, 45.44 % for the 4th heatwave day and above) and the time-distance of heatwaves from the warm season onset was also found to be associated with increased CVD mortality. These findings suggest that tailored heatwave action plans and risk communication strategies could mitigate the higher risks associated with specific characteristics of more intense and prolonged heatwaves anticipated in the future.",

Results showed that NDVI and SIF significantly increased but DFI significantly decreased from 2001 to 2022, with proportion of over 67 % of natural vegetation area.

The SVPN and SVPD decreased from arid to humid regions, SVPS was high in semi-arid and semi-humid regions. The SVP was correlated with precipitation, runoff, CO 2 and surface soil moisture (SSM), and their correlation was higher in drier regions. The SVT of NDVI (SVTN) of natural vegetation increased while SVT of SIF (SVTS) and DFI (SVTD) decreased during 2001-2022, with average of 13.3 × 10 −3 /°C, 7 × 10 −3 /°C, and −1.2/°C, respectively. And there was no significant spatial variation of SVT in different climate regions. The SVT was correlated with aridity index (AI), potential evapotranspiration (PET), temperature and SSM. The explanation of climate, hydrological, and CO 2 for SVP and SVT was over 64 %, especially for SVTD at 76.2 %. The influencing factors had great explanations for alpine vegetation, desert, needle-leaf forest, and shrubland, and small explanations for broadleaf forest, mixed forest, and wetland. Overall, natural vegetation of China greened and its dependence on climate change decreased, SVP and SVT were driven by hydrology and heat, respectively. These findings will provide scientific basis for vegetation to cope with future extreme events and maintain vegetation stability.",

By combining ground-based datasets and ESMs, we find that this paradoxical phenomenon is predominantly driven by an overestimation of light snowfall frequency. Using spatially distributed emergent constraints, we show that this paradox persists in mid- (2041-2060) and long-term (2081-2100) projections, affecting more than half of the Northern Hemisphere’s land surface. ESMs underestimate the frequency of freezing days by 12-19% and overestimate snow water equivalent by 28-34%. Constrained projections indicate that the raw ESM outputs overestimate future Northern Hemisphere snowmelt water by 12-16% across 53-60% of the Northern Hemisphere’s land surface. This snowmelt water overprediction implies that the amount of water available in the future for agriculture, industry, ecosystems and domestic use may be lower than unadjusted ESM projections suggest.",

      "abstract": "Soil erosion remains a critical environmental issue in South Korea due to its mountainous terrain and variable climatic conditions, adversely affecting agriculture, water quality, and infrastructure. While the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) is widely used for large-scale assessments, its limitations in scalability and capturing complex environmental interactions in diverse landscapes persist. Machine learning (ML) techniques offer a promising alternative by handling large datasets and modeling non-linear relationships, yet their ‘black box’ nature often hinders interpretability, which is essential for practical applications in soil conservation. This study addresses these challenges by applying six ML algorithms-Random forests (RF), Support vector machines (SVM), AdaBoost (AB), Logistic regression (LR), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and Multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-to develop soil erosion susceptibility maps (SESM) across South Korea. Using the RUSLE model for preliminary identification and combined with high-resolution satellite images, we assigned erosion-prone areas to serve as the training data for our analysis. Thirteen key environmental factors were considered. To enhance the interpretability of the ML models, we integrated SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), a method to attribute predictions to individual features, to enhance ML model interpretability. Our results indicate that the RF and SVM models achieved the highest predictive accuracy. SHAP analysis revealed that slope and land cover were the most influential in predicting SESM. This approach bridges advanced modeling techniques and practical applicability, enabling targeted soil conservation strategies in South Korea and offering a scalable framework for other erosion-prone regions.",

      "abstract": "Agriculture is a major contributor to nutrient pollution that drives eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems. This study integrates hydrological modeling with farmer behavioral analysis to assess the effectiveness of two agricultural conservation practices-cover crops and reduced nitrogen fertilizer application-in reducing nitrate loss from fields in the Tar-Pamlico River Basin of North Carolina. Survey responses from 279 farmers revealed widespread reluctance to adopt conservation practices, particularly strict fertilizer reductions. A hydrological model showed that applying each practice to 25 percent of agricultural land could substantially reduce nitrate export, with cover crops showing greater effectiveness than reduced fertilizer use. However, an integrated socio-hydrological model, which incorporated behavioral responses from farmers, predicted much smaller reductions in nitrate loss due to limited voluntary adoption. Specifically, nitrate reductions were overestimated by a factor of 8 for cover crops and by a factor of 25 for reduced fertilizer application when behavioral responses were excluded. This result highlights a critical limitation of traditional modeling approaches and underscores the importance of integrating human decision-making into environmental policy analysis. By linking policy incentives with both biophysical and social responses, this study offers a more realistic framework for designing cost-effective and impactful agricultural conservation strategies.",

To address this gap, we propose a modeling framework that combines river flow observations, paleo-hydrological reconstructions, and climate model simulations. Such diversity of climate information, that is bridged in a flexible approach, allows evaluating the hazard of hydrological droughts for any large catchment globally. By focusing on the specific case of Alpine regions and analyzing the information contained in an ensemble for the period 1100-2100, we show that, compared to the past nine centuries, the mean annual flow in the Po River (Italy's main water course) may decrease by about 10% during the 21st century, while the mean drought duration and severity are likely to increase by approximately 11% and 12%, respectively. Future drought conditions are likely to match, or even exceed, the driest period of the Medieval Climate Anomaly under different emissions scenarios. This indicates unprecedented drought conditions in Alpine regions in the coming decades, thus calling for an increased preparedness in managing water resources under climate change.",

As a result, snow droughts have gained considerable attention in recent research in the context of global climate change. However, there are few studies on the long-term variations in global snow droughts. Therefore, we analyzed the trend of global snow droughts from 1951 to 2021 using the Snow Water Equivalent Index (SWEI) calculated from the ERA5-Land dataset, including the availability of ERA5-Land data, SWEI variation trends, changes in SWEI with latitude and elevation, as well as the frequency, severity, and risk of snow droughts. Our findings show that ERA5-Land demonstrates relatively good performance in simulating snow depth. There has been a significant intensification of global snow droughts over the past 71 years, with a period of mitigation from 1959 to 1979 and intensification from 1980 to 2021, particularly in spring. Snow drought occurrence varies considerably with latitude and elevation. Over the 71-year period, the area, frequency, severity, and risk of snow droughts initially declined, followed by an increase, with the lowest levels observed in the 1980s. Compared to the 1951-1979 period, the 1980-2021 period saw elevated levels of snow drought frequency, severity, and risk. The most severely affected areas include the midwestern United States, western and eastern Canada, south-central Europe, western Siberia, Russia, Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, and northeastern China. This study provides a scientific basis for snow drought early warning systems and enhances the ability of regions to cope with the impacts of potential snow droughts.",

Here, we use tritium age dating to show that contrary to the common assumption that snowmelt quickly contributes to runoff, streamflow during snowmelt in western US catchments is dominated by older groundwater. The average age of streamwater during snowmelt runoff (5.7 ± 4.3 years) was intermediate to the average age of groundwater (10.4 ± 4.5 years) and recent precipitation, indicating that 58% (±34%) of snowmelt runoff was derived from groundwater. Water ages, streamflow, and groundwater storage were mediated by bedrock geology: low-permeability hard rock/shale catchments exhibited younger ages, less storage, and more efficient streamflow generation than high-permeability sandstone/clastic catchments. Our results demonstrate that snowmelt runoff is the result of multiple prior years of climate mediated by groundwater storage. Including these interactions will be crucial for predicting water resources as climate and landscape changes accelerate.",

Observed streamflow, although strongly correlated with SSC, was not used as a predictor since it is not measured for most rivers. The SSC data between 1983 and 2017 from 167 USGS stations in the Mississippi River Basin were used. The LSTM models were trained using two objective functions: normalized mean square errors (NMSE) and normalized mean absolute error (NMAE). The models were tested in gauged and hypothetical ungauged scenarios. In the gauged scenario, the LSTM was trained on the data from all the watersheds; in the ungauged scenario, the LSTM was trained using a leave-location-and-time-out scheme. About 78% and 50% of the watersheds had positive Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiencies (NSEs) in the gauged and ungauged scenarios, respectively. A slight improvement in model performance was achieved when streamflow simulated by the variable infiltration capacity model was used as one of the predictors. The model trained on the NMAE instead of the NMSE objective function improved the simulations of low SSCs in several watersheds. The model performance was poor in some of the watersheds due to the small amount of training data available in these watersheds, suggesting that it is crucial to collect riverine SSC data to develop reliable models. Overall, these results are encouraging as the SSC could be simulated accurately in many of the watersheds.",

      "abstract": "Snow droughts, that is negative anomalies in annual snow storage, challenge water resources management in snow-rich catchments and their downstream regions because they can lead to succeeding streamflow droughts in the following melt season. Under continued global warming, snow droughts are expected to become more frequent and intense, which likely increases the occurrence of succeeding streamflow droughts. However, we still know little about the rate at which snow droughts propagate to subsequent streamflow droughts, the spatial patterns of these concurrent events, the influence of snow drought characteristics on the occurrence, deficit, and duration of streamflow droughts, and temporal changes in snow drought propagation. To address these research gaps, we developed a novel dynamic bi-directional snow-to-streamflow drought propagation scheme, that resulted in a unique dataset of concurrent snow and streamflow droughts for 207 catchments in Switzerland and Austria. We found that in the period from 1961 to 2020, 18% of the snow droughts propagated to a streamflow drought, and that 21% of the spring/summer streamflow droughts were preceded by a snow drought. Snow-to-streamflow droughts are most common in catchments at high elevations without glaciers and among the snow droughts with the largest deficits and longest durations. In general, snow droughts lead to streamflow droughts with higher deficits, longer durations, and earlier occurrences. In the last six decades, the number of snow droughts has increased, which resulted in a doubling of snow-to-streamflow drought events in 1991-2020 compared to 1961-1990. As snow droughts are expected to further increase due to climate change, the propagation of snow-to-streamflow droughts will likely increase in medium to high elevation catchments and lead to more frequent and intense spring and summer droughts in the Alps.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning methods have demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing nonlinear relationships for water quality prediction, yet existing studies predominantly focus on individual monitoring sites while neglecting pollutant spatial dynamics. To address this limitation, a Spatio-Temporal Feature Graph Neural Network (STF-GNN) was proposed, which integrated graph convolutional networks (GCN), gated recurrent units (GRU), and self-attention mechanisms to explicitly model multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies among distributed monitoring stations. By representing stations as graph nodes with adjacency relationships, STF-GNN could simultaneously extract spatial topological features and temporal evolution patterns from multivariate time series data. Experimental results demonstrated superior performance in dissolved oxygen (DO) and total nitrogen (TN) prediction, achieving RMSE values of 0.233 (DO) and 0.033 (TN), outperforming baseline models by 36.54-161.47 % in accuracy. Cross-basin validations revealed robust generalization capabilities of the established model, maintaining maximum relative errors below 0.639 (DO) and 0.606 (TN) without site-specific customization. Notably, the model achieved 88 % peak-valley synchronization at untrained station, demonstrating strong anti-interference ability against unseen environmental variations. Ablation studies confirmed the necessity of both spatial and temporal modules, with their omission causing significant accuracy declines (12.07-19.25 %). These findings highlighted the critical roles of both spatial and temporal feature extraction in improving predictive performance of the model. The work can provide a theoretically grounded framework for spatially-aware water quality prediction, supporting enhanced environmental monitoring strategies.",

Most climate research has focused on major annual crops like cereals and has focused on the overall impact of climate change on yields providing limited actionable knowledge to support adaptation. In this study, we bring together climate scientists, biometeorology specialists, plant scientists, and agricultural engineers to develop a new perennial crop modeling framework that integrates climate modeling, horticulture and agronomy science, and statistical modeling. We apply this framework to California almonds as a case study, because they offer robust data to calibrate and evaluate our model. Our model quantifies the influence of climate in each almond development stage and of innovation on county-level yields. We simulate future yield changes under a large multi-model ensemble of high-resolution climate simulations and innovation scenarios. We find that climate change could lead to yield losses of 17% by 2100 under moderate warming (SSP245) and 49% under high warming (SSP585); however, we also find that sustained innovation gains could more than offset these negative climate impacts. We identify increasing minimum temperatures and humidity during the bloom and pollination period as well as heat stress during the growing period as the main drivers of yield losses. We discuss synergistic strategies to limit the negative impacts of climate change and to ensure continued gains from innovation. This modeling approach could provide valuable insights into climate adaptation strategies for other perennial crops and regions.",

      "abstract": "Understanding how climatic factors affect ecosystem carbon and water processes is essential for preserving ecosystem health and managing water resources effectively. In addition to their direct impacts, climatic factors also indirectly regulate these fluxes by modifying leaf area index (LAI) and root-zone soil moisture (SMroot). Therefore, this study employed structural equation modeling to evaluate the total (STE), direct (SDE), and indirect (SIE) effects of climatic factors on ecological indicators (EIs). The EIs included gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and ecosystem water use efficiency (eWUE). The findings indicate that temperature is the key climatic driver of GPP, with its STEs ranging from 0.34 to 0.89. The LAI-mediated indirect effect (SIE LAI ) accounts for over 58.6% of the STE, suggesting that warming-induced increases in GPP are primarily due to enhanced LAI. Climatic factors affect ET mainly through direct impacts. In arid regions, STEs of precipitation on ET range from 0.28 to 0.56, whereas in humid regions, STEs range from 0.03 to 0.28, suggesting that precipitation has a more pronounced effect on ET under water-limited conditions. In contrast, under sufficient water availability in humid regions, temperature plays a crucial role in driving ET, with STEs exceeding 0.78. Notably, the indirect effect of precipitation on ET via replenishing SMroot (SIE SMroot ) accounts for more than 50.6% of the SIE in arid and semi-arid regions, indicating that SMroot is a critical mediator of precipitation’s impact on ET. Although wind speed and CO 2 have minimal effects on GPP and ET, they significantly reduce eWUE by lowering GPP and raising ET. As a result, they become key climatic drivers in most regions, particularly in agricultural lands, where STEs fall below −0.36. Warming can enhance eWUE in most regions. However, the effect of precipitation depends on local water availability. It tends to lower eWUE in arid and semi-arid regions and slightly increase it in humid and semi-humid regions.",

Furthermore, many studies were conducted at a low resolution (250-1000 m), which may increase the uncertainty of NPP estimates due to mixed pixels. This study used improved multisource data synergized quantitative (MuSyQ) NPP model to estimate NPP in Beijing during 1990-2020 at a 30 meters (m) resolution, and quantified the effects induced by urban expansion and climate change across different urban expansion stages and functional zones. The urban area in Beijing increased by 1823.91 km 2 over the study period, the fastest expansion rate occurred between 2000 and 2013, resulting in great NPP loss (18.21 GgCyear −1 ) (1 Gg = 10 9 g). The increasingly severe climate change has also led to a reduction in NPP, but this impact is much smaller than the direct loss of NPP caused by urban expansion. Especially between 2000 and 2013, the average annual NPP loss attributed to urban expansion is approximately 22.66 times greater than that caused by climate change. Our findings highlight the urgent need to develop regional strategies to address urban expansion, enhance natural carbon sinks, and achieve sustainable development.",

However, with the role of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in narrowing temperature ranges and changing precipitation patterns is well understood, its impact on moisture recycling is little known. Here, we tracked precipitation in the TGR basin back to evaporated moisture to explore the features of moisture recycling and quantify local evaporation ratios in the pre-dam (1980-2002) and post-dam (2003-2022) periods. The influences of the forcing data, simulation time steps and different tracking models on evaporation recycling are investigated. Relevant mechanisms are analyzed in terms of atmospheric motion, surface radiation, land cover changes and climate variability impacts. Results indicate that the precipitationshed shows a reduction in both summer and winter during the post-dam period. Local evaporation recycling ratios (ERRs) in TGR basin decrease by 0.46%, 1.07%, 0.59, 0.94% during the post-TGD period relative to the pre-TGD period in spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively. Local evaporation contributions are limited in both the pre-dam and post-dam periods, especially in dry years. The reduced precipitation in TGR region is more dependent on upwind moisture, which results from the enhanced sinking motion and moisture divergence. Although different forcing data and simulation time steps show good agreement in spatial and temporal variations in the recycled moisture, the local ERRs are larger when calculated from the UTrack model than from the WAM-2layers model.",

However, the SSI metric must be improved to better describe the peak characteristics of precipitation ( P) , and the contribution of SSI changes to hydrologic partitioning remains unclear. Focusing on 22 basins in the Qilian Mountains of northwest China, we explored recent changes in SSI by improving SSI metric based on a corrected sinusoidal function and quantified the effect of snow storage change on streamflow by Budyko framework. The results showed that the ability of the western basins to store snow water was stronger than that of the eastern basins. This ability has been enhanced in the western basins in recent decades, with a significant increasing trend in annual SSI ( p < 0.05), whereas it has been weakened in the eastern basins. The relative contribution of SSI change was positive in 15 of 22 basins, with a mean value of 29 %. Our methods and findings could help accurately assess the ability to store snow water and quantitatively understand its effect on hydrological responses in snow-dependent regions.",

Based on standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) data, gross primary productivity (GPP) data and vegetation transpiration data, we use linear regression (LR) and random forest (RF) model to explored the impact of canopy height on forest carbon and water cycle in southwestern China for the 2010 extreme drought. Regardless of forest types, the results showed that the decline of GPP and transpiration were not only related to drought intensity but also depend on canopy height. Tall forest (> 30 m) would lose more GPP and transpiration than short forest (< 20 m), and the increasing drought intensities would improve this canopy height-dependency, especially under extreme drought condition (SPEI < −2). Regarding how canopy height affects forest water cycle, the canopy height has correlation with both SPEI and transpiration ( p < 0.001) which mean tall forest needs more water to maintain growth. These results explore the reason why forest drought resistance distinguishing by canopy height, which may have a broad range implication in forest dynamics research and management.",

Analyzing a 79-year dataset (1940-2019) from US Forest Service regions across the continental United States, we found that different ignition sources in different regions have been a major driver of wildfire trends, accounting for 60%-80% of the interannual variation in fire frequency and approximately 20% in area burned across most US regions. Lightning and campfires were the dominant sources in western regions, while arson drove fire activity east of the Mississippi River. Trends also varied significantly by region and over time, with housing growth explaining more in terms of fire frequency and climate primarily influencing area burned. Importantly, frequent fires often originated from different sources than those causing the largest areas burned. Prevention of human-caused ignitions, such as campfires and arson, could offer efficient and effective strategies to mitigate wildfire impacts on human and natural systems under changing climate and land-use conditions.",

      "abstract": "Improving climate models to better forecast water-related hazards, such as floods, and managing water resources requires understanding how extreme precipitation events (EPEs) are propagated across spatial and temporal scales. Complex network analysis is a promising approach to study spatial and temporal dependencies in large unstructured data, such as those in climate science. Here, we studied EPEs and their synchronization in North America using complex network analysis. We constructed the EPEs networks based on the gauge-based daily precipitation data from the Climate Prediction Center database. The nodes within the networks were the geographical grid points connected through the links determined by applying a non-linear method called event synchronization. We analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns within the complex networks of EPEs via network measures, such as degree centrality (DC), mean geographical distance (MGD), clustering coefficient (CC), betweenness centrality (BC) and long-ranged directedness (LD). We first found hubs-locations important in propagating EPEs and teleconnections-in areas such as Montana, Wyoming, Alberta, and Saskatchewan in summers and the West Coast and eastern North America in winters. We demonstrated that the EPEs are more spatially coherent during winters than summers across the continent. We then identified certain locations in Utah, Colorado, South Dakota, northern Mexico, southeast British Columbia, and northern Quebec that play a crucial role in the long spatial propagation of the EPEs from one region to another throughout the summer, while regions in the West Coast, southern Colorado, New Mexico, Wisconsin, and central Alberta are dominant in the winter. Additionally, we uncovered atmospheric moisture pathways for the EPEs in both seasons. Finally, we showed that the EPEs complex networks are sensitive to the lag time τ max, a parameter in the ES method. As such, it should be chosen depending on the atmospheric phenomena of interest and its temporal scale.",

      "abstract": "Traditional vulnerability assessments of climate change impacts often rely on randomised precipitation scenarios that lack a strong physical science basis. Furthermore, the limitations of General Circulation Models (GCMs) in accurately representing local precipitation fields undermine their utility for projecting future hydroclimatic extremes. To address these gaps in climate risk management, this study explores the role of large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, known as weather regimes (WRs), in explaining local and regional precipitation dynamics in South Africa. Utilising a Non-Homogeneous Hidden Markov Chain approach, we identified six primary WRs for South Africa, each exhibiting distinct seasonal patterns. The results show that winter precipitation near Cape Town is dominated by three WRs linked to higher rainfall, whilst summer precipitation is influenced by two WRs associated with drier conditions. The WR-precipitation relationship in South Africa appears to be influenced by topographic features (e.g., The Great Escarpment and Cape Fold Mountains) and ocean currents (Agulhas and Benguela), leading to distinct spatial precipitation responses to regional WR configurations. Importantly, significant shifts in seasonal WR frequencies have been observed over the past two decades, particularly a marked change since 2010. Notably, a WR historically associated with rainfall in Cape Town has been replaced by a drier WR, contributing to worsening drought conditions, including the 2015-2017 “Day Zero” drought. During this period, the WR associated with dryness in Cape Town occurred more frequently than the historical average, whilst wetter years before and after the drought were characterised by low-pressure (low 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies) WRs conducive to precipitation. In contrast, the drought years were dominated by high-pressure (high 500 hPa geopotential height anomaly) WRs associated with dry conditions. This WR-precipitation analysis underscores the critical link between atmospheric circulation patterns and regional hydroclimatic extremes. These findings can inform the development of WR-based rainfall generators, providing valuable tools for vulnerability assessments and climate change adaptation planning.",

Using vapor pressure deficit (VPD), soil moisture (SM), and two vegetation indexes including the leaf area index (LAI) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), here we quantified the vegetation susceptibility to these three drought types via coincidence analysis and evaluated the spatiotemporal patterns of them. Spatially, we found most of global vegetated areas (63.8 %) were more susceptible to compound droughts, with the higher vegetation susceptibility to them in the areas with less tree cover and more arid climate, respectively. Temporally, we revealed a predominated increasing trend (0.0027 year −1 for LAI and 0.0023 year −1 for SIF, P < 0.05) in vegetation susceptibility to compound droughts over drought-susceptible regions during 2001-2020.

      "abstract": "Climate change has intensified droughts, severely reducing vegetation productivity and even shifting the ecosystem from a carbon sink to a carbon source. Thus, understanding the spatial and temporal variations in vegetation responses to droughts is increasingly important. This study conducts coincidence analysis to examine the vulnerability and response time of vegetation to summer droughts from 1982 to 2022 across the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and employs random forest and partial correlation methods to identify their underlying drivers. The results reveal that arid regions and grasslands exhibit higher coincidence rates and shorter response time. Grasslands have the highest coincidence rate (0.38) and shortest response time (23 days), followed by shrublands, savannas, deciduous forests, and evergreen forests. Trends indicate that vegetation coincidence rates increased significantly (0.1/decade from 1993 to 2013), while lagged days decreased (-7.8 days/decade from 1990 to 2005), showing greater vulnerability to droughts. Spring phenology and productivity influence coincidence rate variations in about 27 % of the study area. Higher latitudes and cold regions exhibit stronger correlations between the start of growing season dates (SOS) and coincidence rates, suggesting that earlier growing seasons may enhance resistance to summer droughts in boreal forests. Conversely, in grasslands, earlier SOS negatively correlates with coincidence rates, indicating that rapid vegetation growth increases drought-related losses. These findings highlight the need to consider vegetation phenology interactions in drought assessments to improve ecosystem resilience and predictability.",

      "abstract": "River floods threaten life and economic stability, with risks increasing globally, especially in densely populated coastal areas. In mountainous coastal watersheds like the Delaware River Basin, rising temperature is projected to reduce snowpack, reshaping upstream-downstream flood dynamics. However, the impact on flood synchronization between upland tributaries and estuarine mainstems remains poorly understood. Using multidecadal streamflow simulations from a high-resolution hydrological model, we find significant increases in the frequency and magnitude of synchronized floods under future warming scenarios, particularly severe floods (above the 75 th percentile). Under higher warming scenarios, snowpack and rain-on-snow floods in headwater subbasins nearly vanish. Surprisingly, this regime shift amplifies estuarine flooding by enhancing synchronization between historically snow-dominated subbasins and their downstream counterparts. Despite intensified synchronization and flood magnitude, cold-season flood risk declines due to fewer rain-on-snow events. Conversely, summer floods grow larger, more frequent, and synchronized, driving a seasonal reconfiguration of flood risk that should be considered in future mitigation strategies.",

      "abstract": "The perennial Himalayan rivers rely heavily on snowmelt runoff as a crucial supply of freshwater. The present study employs several geospatial methodologies, including remote sensing (RS), geographic information systems (GIS), and the snowmelt runoff model (SRM), to forecast the snowmelt runoff in the Beas River basin located in the Western Himalayas. This study employed a combination of Landsat 8 Snow Cover Area (SCA) data, the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with GIS, and the Windows version of the SRM (WinSRM) to calculate the amount of water resulting from snowmelt in the Beas River basin, specifically up to the Pandoh dam. Accurately predicting the amount of water resulting from the melting of snow and its subsequent flow in different areas is crucial for effectively managing natural resources. The SRM was performed using hydrometeorological data collected between 2013 and 2015. We used RS data spanning from 2013 to 2015 to ascertain the temporal extent of snow cover in the Beas River region. Afterward, we created aspect maps and elevation zones using the DEM. This research used the SRM, a snowmelt runoff simulation model that utilizes a temperature index, to precisely replicate the snowmelt runoff process. We performed a simulation of snowmelt runoff using daily hydrometeorological data obtained from the Meteorological and Oceanographic Satellite Data Archival Centre (MOSDAC). This data consisted of information on rainfall, as well as the highest and lowest temperatures. The study area has 12 distinct elevation zones, and we computed the extent of snow coverage. The basin has a snow cover that varies from 16% to 52%. We evaluated the model's effectiveness by using the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) and volume difference (Dv). The R 2 and Dv values for the calibration and validation periods were 0.74 (with a 3.61% error) and 0.77 (with a 9.76% error), respectively.",

      "abstract": "Flash droughts are sudden, short-term drought events that develop within weeks, unlike traditional droughts that unfold gradually over time. These events arise from a combination of climatic factors, such as low rainfall, high temperatures, and strong winds, which rapidly deplete soil moisture and stress vegetation, leading to severe agricultural, economic, and ecological impacts. Despite the significant challenges in defining and analysing flash droughts, only a few studies have employed machine learning techniques to predict these occurrences. The use of machine learning in this context remains in its early stages due to complications like imbalanced datasets and limited data size. This study addresses these challenges by employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict flash droughts in Eastern Australia - a region historically prone to these events. We identified flash droughts from 2001 to 2022, with the model training performed on data from 2001-2015, validation from 2016-2017, and testing from 2018-2022. The model's performance was assessed across different scenarios, including drought duration, spatial distribution, and seasonal variability. The CNN achieved a balanced accuracy of 80% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 93%, demonstrating its capability to predict flash drought events effectively. While the model showed promising results in accurately forecasting flash droughts, it tended to overestimate the spatial extent of drought-prone regions, highlighting areas for future improvement. These findings underscore the potential of deep learning, in enhancing our understanding and prediction of flash droughts, offering a valuable tool for early warning systems and drought management strategies.",

To improve the DO prediction accuracy, a graph neural network based on indicator attention mechanism and bayesian optimization (BO-AM-MTGNN) was proposed in this study. Hourly water quality data at 20 sampling sites in the Chaohu Lake basin from January 2022 to February 2024 were used as the research dataset. The effectiveness of the BO-AM-MTGNN model was validated through comparisons with baseline models (XGBoost, LightGBM, LSTM, GRU, Informer) and ablation experiment (BO-AM-MTGNN, AM-MTGNN, MTGNN). The results demonstrated that the BO-AM-MTGNN model effectively captured the temporal and spatial information of water quality data. Correlations between indicators can be fully extracted by the indicator attention mechanism. Compared with the MTGNN model, the MAE, RMSE, and MAPE of the BO-AM-MTGNN model decreased by 12.16 %, 5.50 %, and 12.13 %, respectively. The prediction accuracy of MTGNN outperformed the baseline models, with the performance ranking as follows: MTGNN > Informer > LSTM > GRU > LightGBM > XGBoost.

This study evaluated the data quality of four major United States field crops: corn ( Zea mays L.), cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L.), soybeans ( Glycine max L.), and winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service's (NASS) Gridded Crop Progress and Condition dataset. Upon aggregating the weekly 9 km gridded data to the county level (and further to the state and national level) over the 2015-2023 period, no statistically significant differences emerged between the gridded condition data and the tabular condition data from the USDA NASS Crop Progress and Condition Report (CPCR). In line with state and national-level analyses, a strong linear relationship between crop conditions and yield existed at the county scale. County-level crop condition ratings were a statistically significant covariate of yield during the critical reproduction period through harvest for 90% of corn, 78% of cotton, 90% of soybean, and 96% of winter wheat-producing counties. In addition, intramonthly county-level crop conditions changed accordingly based on the magnitude of temperature and precipitation anomalies during certain phenological stages. In at least 80% of counties for each respective crop, temperatures and precipitation were statistically significant covariates for crop condition changes. The relationships between USDA NASS gridded crop condition data, CPCR data, yield, and climate substantiate the utility and fidelity of this dataset as a representation of confidential crop condition reports, supporting its practical application in research and operational decision-making.",

      "abstract": "Forest fires, driven by global change, have become an increasingly severe concern for the future. To mitigate this uncertainty, understanding the projected response patterns of forest fires under climate change can provide valuable insights, especially in regions like China, where forest fires are prone to occur and highly sensitive to climate variations. This study used the Random Forest algorithm to develop predictive models for occurrence probability, intensity levels, and burned area of forest fires in China. These models were applied to future climate simulations under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, providing predictions for the mid-term (2041-2060) and long-term (2081-2100) periods with a comparative analysis against the baseline period (2001-2020) to assess relative changes. Results show that, by the end of the century, 60 % to 70 % of forested areas in China are projected to face increased fire risk, with the average percentage increase not exceeding 20 %, and most low-risk areas remaining at low risk. Nevertheless, the transition to moderate or high fire risk is particularly significant in the long term under SSP5-8.5, with hotspots such as the Greater Khingan Mountains, central and southeastern hilly regions, and the gorges of the western Yunnan Plateau. While fire intensity in most fire-prone areas is projected to remain at medium-to-low levels, localized intensification is possible in southwestern China. The increase in burned areas is projected to be widespread, covering 63 % to 64 % of fire-prone areas, with the greatest growth occurring in the mid-term and under SSP5-8.5. Compared to the southern regions, northeastern China shows a smaller proportion of areas experiencing increased burned areas but a larger total increase, indicating more concentrated fires in specific areas. These findings reveal the distinct future trajectories of different forest fire characteristics with regional variability in China, offering critical information for their comprehensive consideration and integration into forward-looking, scientifically robust national fire prevention planning.",

Globally, we found significant increases in ozone (+ 6%) and small, non-significant changes in fine particulate matter (+ 0%), nitrogen dioxide (− 1%), and fossil-fuel carbon dioxide emissions (+ 4%). Also, over 50% of urban areas showed positive correlations for all pollutant pairs, though results varied by global region. High-income countries with strong mitigation policies experienced decreases in all pollutants, while regions with rapid economic growth had overall increases.

The results indicate that Stacking-EML not only significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to individual models and traditional CMIP6 outputs but also enhances climate projections by integrating multiple ML models, offering more reliable, regionally refined forecasts. Findings show R2 improvements to 0.99 for maximum temperature, 0.98 for minimum temperature, and 0.82 for precipitation. Under SSP5-8.5, summer temperatures in southern regions are expected to exceed 45 C, exacerbating drought conditions due to reduced rainfall.

      "abstract": "Ecosystem services are important for human well-being and for sustaining environmental quality objectives. Growing concern over extreme wildfire events in various watersheds necessitates understanding their impacts on regulating ecosystems services. Past studies have documented how wildfires regulate ecosystem services, but the distributional impacts of such ecosystem services across various human settlements (ie communities) remains understudied, despite renewed focus on how they are increasingly at risk from and being impacted by wildfires. We used the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model to examine how two wildfires that occurred in California, USA in 2017 impacted water provisioning, soil loss and sediment delivery, carbon sequestration services, and nutrient delivery in two watersheds and their respective communities. Regression analyses were used to determine the differences in the distribution of ecosystem services before and after the fires, and whether these wildfires exacerbated the differences in impacts to ecosystem services across communities in the watershed. We find that a year following the fires, the amount of biomass in forestland, woodland, and chaparral declined in both studied watersheds, while the amount of grassland increased. The model revealed that the changes in vegetation resulted in losing about 200,000 tons of carbon from the Mark West subwatershed and about 160,000 tons of carbon from the southern California watersheds. The expected mean annual water yield for both watersheds increased by 5% and 42%, respectively post-fire. Expected post-fire phosphorus and nitrogen export also increased. Finally, we found evidence of human community-level differences in the distribution of pre-fire ecosystem services but no evidence that post-fire conditions either exacerbated or alleviated these impacts.",

In this study, eddy covariance flux measurements from 50 forest ecosystems were integrated with simulations from 14 terrestrial biosphere models to investigate how climate conditions and atmospheric CO 2 concentrations regulate forest GPP. This approach bridges site-level observations with biome-scale model estimates to develop a global understanding. Our findings suggest that in boreal and cold temperate regions, temperature primarily constrains the enhancement of the CO 2 fertilization on forest GPP; however, warming and higher atmospheric CO 2 levels are projected to alleviate these limitations. In tropical forests, CO 2 fertilization strongly enhances GPP, but this benefit will be counterbalanced by the adverse impacts of projected climate warming. Consequently, the interplay between climate and atmospheric CO 2 in affecting forest GPP is dynamic and subject to continual change.",

Large-scale climate oscillations are key drivers of climate conditions that disrupt agricultural productivity. However, how such effects are shifting under greenhouse warming remains unclear. Here, we integrate machine learning with process-based crop models to quantify changes in climate-oscillation-driven yield variability under warming scenarios. We find that climate change increases the dominance of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in the Northern Hemisphere and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Southern Hemisphere, exposing an additional 5.1%-12% of global croplands to climate oscillation shocks. Negative NAO and El Niño events are projected to cause simultaneous yield losses of 2.0%-8.4% across multiple breadbaskets, while opposite phases provide weaker benefits, indicating asymmetric impacts and greater food security risks. We highlight the importance of incorporating shifting teleconnections into early-warning systems and targeted adaptation strategies to enhance global food-system resilience.",

      "abstract": "Atmospheric heatwave events have substantial socioeconomic impacts, which have been widely studied under global climate change. This study investigates the characteristics and differences between long-lived and short-lived heatwave events (LHWs and SHWs). First, we identify heatwave events over the Western North America (WNA) over 1981-2022 and categorize them based on the 90th percentile of their duration parameter. Then, we reveal that the LHWs exhibit stronger surface warming with a stronger and thicker warm layer. Circulation anomalies show an anomalous ridge above the WNA, which is more persistent with a greater central value of positive geopotential height anomalies for LHWs. Furthermore, we reveal the important role of mid-to-high-latitude teleconnection in maintaining the LHWs. We find that the diabatic heating released by increased precipitation near Japan can excite Rossby wave trains crossing the Pacific Ocean, and then reach North America, which contributes to maintaining the anomalous ridge of LHWs. Moreover, positive diabatic heating anomalies, related to land-atmosphere interaction, in Central Siberia are also favorable for the generation or persistence of the anomalous ridge and thus the LHWs. Finally, we validate the above teleconnection mechanisms by using the linear baroclinic model and Community Atmosphere Model 5.0 model. By comparison, there is negligible cross-Pacific propagation of Rossby wave energy before the peak of SHWs. This study presents evidence of climate linkages of East Asia and Central Siberia with WNA, which may provide potential predictability for LHWs over the WNA.",

Here, we analyze historical data, land surface model warming experiments, and climate projections across three major WUS river basins. We find that runoff loss become less sensitive to warming as snowpack shrinks, stemming from reduced snowmelt-radiation feedback, a consequence of smaller snow-cover changes and shifts in snowmelt timing to lower-energy periods. Near-linear projected warming with time (IPCC SSP245) exhibit a stable, possibly decelerating decline in runoff ratios. Although decelerating runoff declines do not eliminate broader water-management challenges under continued warming, our findings complement the view that snowmelt-radiation feedback drives runoff decline by highlighting the negative feedback from a shrinking snowpack on runoff warming sensitivity. Our findings should facilitate more comprehensive future water supply assessments in snow-affected regions.",

Here, we present data integrating satellite-based tree cover observations into a machine learning framework to estimate tree cover carrying capacity (percentage of tree coverage), which reflects the maximum potential tree cover, accounting for natural disturbances. Our model improves upon previous estimates by reducing prediction errors, better aligning with tree cover observations in intact areas, and lowering spatial variance in areas without topographical variation. However, uncertainties remain, particularly in regions where human activity has significantly altered landscapes. The tree cover carrying capacity provides an estimate of potential tree cover based on climatic and soil conditions. This serves as an initial step in identifying afforestation/reforestation opportunities but should be further assessed for land-use competition, ecological feasibility, and other limitations.",

The majority of terrestrial biodiversity is concentrated in the tropics3, including species considered most vulnerable to climate warming4, but extensive and ongoing deforestation of tropical forests is likely to impede range shifts5,6. We conduct a global assessment of the potential for tropical species to reach analogous future climates-‘climate connectivity’-and empirically test how this has changed in response to deforestation between 2000 and 2012. We find that over 62% of tropical forest area (~10 million km2) is already incapable of facilitating range shifts to analogous future climates. In just 12 years, continued deforestation has caused a loss of climate connectivity for over 27% of surviving tropical forest, with accelerating declines in connectivity as forest loss increased. On average, if species’ ranges shift as far down climate gradients as permitted by existing forest connectivity, by 2070 they would still experience 0.77 °C of warming under the least severe climate warming scenario and up to 2.6 °C warming for the most severe scenario. Limiting further forest loss and focusing the global restoration agenda towards creating climate corridors are global priorities for improving resilience of tropical forest biotas under climate change.",

This study aims to classify the highest 50 global smart cities based on key livability and technology indices, using advanced machine learning (ML) models to assess city performance comprehensively. The necessity of this research lies in its focus on identifying patterns and best practices among high-performing cities, offering actionable insights for urban planners and policymakers aiming to improve smart city initiatives. This approach is necessary for understanding and replicating best practices in urban management and smart city development. Focusing on high-ranking cities ensures the study analyzes robust and reliable data, avoiding noise and inconsistencies arising from lower-performing or less-documented cases. Drawing on data from the Smart Cities Index (SCI) and other economic and sustainability competitiveness metrics, the study uses various ML algorithms to categorize cities into performance classes, ranging from high-achieving Class 1 to emerging Class 3 cities. The methodology involves data preparation with imputation and normalization, followed by training 9 supervised ML models. The results show that Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree are identified as the most effective classifiers. Furthermore, the results indicate that cities with well-integrated governance, infrastructure, and sustainability practices consistently rank higher, while cities in the lower classes face challenges in these areas. Policy implications suggest that cities aiming to enhance their smart city performance should prioritize comprehensive urban management strategies that balance technological infrastructure with sustainability and public service accessibility to drive more equitable and resilient urban growth.",

This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing deep learning (DL) models for forecasting future annual GPP based on historical data. Specifically, we introduce a novel model, LSTM-Transformer-Group model (LTG), tailored to the unique characteristics of GPP prediction in Central Asia. Based on MODIS GPP data, we evaluate the future annual GPP prediction performance of the LTG model and classical DL models, and we further examine the impact of different input time steps on prediction accuracy and carefully investigate the influence of climatic factors on the accuracy of annual GPP predictions. Furthermore, we evaluate the LTG model's long-term forecasting capability. Our experiments reveal several key findings: (1) DL models adeptly capture the temporal dynamics within GPP time series, facilitating direct prediction of future annual GPP based on past data. The proposed LTG model, optimized with an appropriate input time step, achieves superior prediction accuracy, yielding an R 2 of 0.945; (2) GPP prediction performance varies across different climatic zones, but integrating climatic variables as direct inputs to DL model does not enhance accuracy and may even diminish performance; (3) Over the long term (2019-2023), the LTG model consistently outperforms, exhibiting an average R 2 exceeding 0.95.

      "abstract": "China faces significant challenges due to escalating irrigation water demands and constrained water resources. However, comprehensive national-level analyses of irrigation water demands integrating multiple crops, spatial scales, and driving factors remain scarce. This study addresses this gap by examining the spatiotemporal dynamics and driving factors of irrigation water demand in China from 2000 to 2018, leveraging the Spatial Production Allocation Model (SPAM) dataset and applying the Penman-Monteith model and a multi-regional Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition approach. During the study period, the Net irrigation water demand ( NW ) peaked at 250.68 G m3 in 2013, with significant declines in the South and East but increases in the water-scarce North and Northwest. Rice dominated national NW , contributing 46-52 % of the total, while regional expansion in rice and cotton cultivation drove significant NW growth in the Northeast and Northwest. The Gross irrigation water demand ( GW ) exhibited a national decrease of 76.65 G m3, and the impacts of four driving factors -water saving technology, planting scale, planting patterns, and climate change - varied over time and across regions. Water-saving technology emerged as the most significant factor in reducing GW , offsetting 90.92 G m3 nationally. However, the expansion of irrigated farmland added 47.96 G m3, particularly in arid regions. Climate change exhibited regionally diverse impacts (-10.35-4.17 G m3), underscoring the need for targeted water management interventions. This study provides valuable insights for optimizing crop patterns, advancing irrigation technologies, and formulating region-specific policies to enhance agricultural water management and ensure food security in China.",

Here, we introduce a unified network-based framework for predicting monsoon precipitation across diverse tropical regions. By leveraging global 2-meter air temperature fields, this approach captures large-scale climate teleconnections, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Rossby waves, enabling accurate forecasts for four key monsoon systems: the South American, East Asian, West African, and Indian monsoons. Our framework achieves remarkable forecasting accuracy with lead times of 4-10 months, outperforming traditional systems such as Seasonal Forecast System 5 and Climate Forecast System version 2. Beyond its predictive capabilities, the framework offers flexibility for application to other regions and climate phenomena, advancing our understanding of global climate dynamics.

While the Y-SEBAL model, an improved SEBAL model based on the nonlinear relationship between net radiation flux and sensible heat flux, offers innovative capabilities for remote sensing-based ET quantification, its physical drivers and regional scalability across heterogeneous landscapes remain inadequately characterized. This study evaluates the performance of Y-SEBAL across China through multi-scale validation, a comparative analysis with widely available ET models (PML_V2 and MOD16), and mechanistic evaluation of its surface energy partitioning framework. Validation utilizing eddy covariance measurements from nine representative flux sites demonstrated strong agreement (average R = 0.78, average centered root mean square deviation (CRMSD) = 0.96 mm·d −1 ). At the national-scale, Y-SEBAL performed best in grassland ecosystems (R = 0.81) and plateau temperate semi-arid zones but systematically overestimated in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Frequency distribution analysis ranked model performance as Y-SEBAL > MOD16 > PML_V2 in peak ET representation. Y-SEBAL’s simplified stomatal resistance parameterization and strong coupling of surface energy components enhance turbulent heat fluxes under water-limited conditions, providing superior performance in water-constrained environments but introducing uncertainty in heterogeneous underlying surface. The framework advances ET quantification in transitional climate zones while highlighting tradeoffs between process representation and regional scalability.",

However, such datasets are limited spatially and temporally across the CONUS, particularly for small, remote streams. Available models are limited in domain (regional), spatial resolution (≥ 10 km), temporal resolution (monthly), or a combination thereof. We address these limitations by developing a satellite remote sensing-based spatial-statistical model, TempEst 2 (“stream TEMPerature ESTimation, version 2”), to estimate daily mean and maximum temperatures at 1 km resolution for ungaged streams of any size across the CONUS. This contrasts with an earlier version, TempEst 1, which used a random forest algorithm at monthly resolution. TempEst 2 also improves over TempEst 1 in interpretability and computational efficiency. In TempEst 2, the streams used for model training and testing cover a wide range of urban and rural land uses, climates, and geographies. TempEst 2 requires minimal input data and tolerates sparse training gage networks, supporting generalization outside the CONUS. For CONUS applications, TempEst 2 is trained on 1,316 USGS ST gages. Quantitative performance impacts from locally-sparse gage networks are reported. Model performance is evaluated using cross-validation, walk-forward validation, and extrapolation validations over regions and elevation. TempEst 2 estimates daily mean temperatures with a median cross-validation gage RMSE of 2.0° C, NSE of 0.91, and bias of 0.10%. TempEst 2 supports the development and analysis of high-resolution, large-domain ST datasets across the CONUS.",

The soil moisture-based two-source energy balance model used the soil resistance and canopy resistance to constrain the soil evaporation and plant transpiration. However, the soil resistance is expressed as an empirical model with soil moisture, which needs to be calibrated to obtain the unknown parameters for different soil types, and the canopy resistance does not consider the influence of soil moisture. In this study, we introduced a dry soil layer (DSL) based soil resistance and an optimal stomatal conductance model (OSM) based canopy resistance, both of which are related to soil moisture, into the two-source energy balance (TSEB) model to constrain the soil evaporation (E) and plant transpiration (T). The new model (TSEB SM ) was evaluated at five sites with a wide range of soil moisture and different vegetation covers, which are located in arid and semi-arid regions. The results showed that the TSEB SM performed better than the TSEB for LE/ET estimation, with about 20 % RMSE reduction in daily ET at irrigated cropland and alpine meadow sites, and a reduction of 31 %, 54 %, and 33 % at desert steppe, shrub forest, and forest sites, respectively. The trends of the E and T partitioned by the TSEB and TSEB SM models followed the temporal trend of LAI, and there is generally better agreement of the E and T between the TSEB SM model and the water use efficiency (uWUE) method. The sensitivity analysis for the resistances in the TSEB SM model elucidated that soil resistance and canopy resistance had more noticeable effect on ET simulation, especially under soil water stressed conditions. Moreover, the results of the two models under different soil moisture conditions showed that the TSEB SM model had a similar performance in LE/ET as the TSEB model under soil moisture sufficient conditions, but it could effectively reduce the overestimation of LE/ET by the TSEB model under water limited conditions (<30 %). Finally, the uncertainty analysis of model input parameters showed that the uncertainty of soil moisture had more significant influence on the model than LAI. Combined with reliable soil moisture from remote sensing, the TSEB SM model has important significance for monitoring evapotranspiration in arid and semi-arid regions.",

      "abstract": "A quantitative understanding of the patterns and drivers of the sensitivity of terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) to compound dry-hot events (CDHEs) is essential to ensure the long-term stability of key ecosystem services under continued warming. However, these processes are still poorly understood and quantified in China due to its complex climate and landscapes shaped by interconnected environmental and human factors. Here, we explore the responses of summer vegetation productivity in China to four severity levels of CDHEs (i.e., mild, moderate, severe, and extreme) over the period 1982-2018 and elucidate the underlying ecological mechanisms. To this aim, we exploit GPP retrievals and meteorological data derived from satellite near-infrared reflectance and CRU datasets, respectively. We develop a copula model and a sliding window algorithm to simulate the dynamic joint behavior of GPP and compound climate conditions and use the ridge regression model for attribution. Results show that CDHEs exhibited - over the observational period - lagged effects on more than 60 % of China’s vegetated regions during summer, with an average lag time of 1.62, 1.73, and 1.82 months in June, July, and August, respectively. The sensitivity of GPP to mild CDHEs decreased in 61.48 %, 65.16 %, and 64.23 % regions from June to August during the study period, largely consistent with the patterns observed for higher CDHEs severity levels. Such emerging signals reflect a widespread enhancement of vegetation adaptability to CDHEs in China over the last decades. Vapor pressure deficit is the prominent driver affecting summer GPP sensitivity, followed by solar radiation, maximum temperature, precipitation, leaf area index, and CO 2 . Overall, these findings contribute to an improved understanding of the effects of CDHEs on terrestrial productivity and provide valuable insights for mitigation measures in key vulnerable areas in China under global warming.",

Globally, the annual PET was 1276.91 mm, with the annual ratios of PT and PE to PET of 44 % and 56 %, respectively. The global mean annual PET, PT, and PE significantly increased by 1.12 mm/yr, 0.44 mm/yr, and 0.67 mm/yr, respectively. Over 48 % of global land, the annual PET changes were controlled by PT, but the rest by PE. Attribution analyses indicated that air temperature was the major contributor of the global mean annual PET, PT, and PE increases, but the determinant factors differed spatially. Although the climate factors as the main contributors of the changes in the three variables had the largest area percentage, more than 16 % of global land showed the dominant factors of Leaf Area Index, CO 2 , and LUCC, especially for annual PT and PE changes with an area percentage exceeding 30 %. This study underlines the necessity of separating PET into PT and PE components and examining them individually to better understand PET changes. Also, it provides new and significant insights for an in-depth understanding of PET’s changes from perspectives of changes in climate and vegetation (e.g., vegetation greening and CO 2 physiological effects), as well as LUCC.",

      "abstract": "Hydro-economic models combine biophysical and socioeconomic variables and, are tools that inform decision-making related to water resources planning. This study analyses the coupling of a hydro-economic model of the Guadalquivir River Basin (GRB) in southern Spain with a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) macroeconomic model, applied to a drought situation and different water management policy scenarios. The two models are interconnected through changes in land use and crop prices. Results show that when the macroeconomic price effects are included in the analysis, there is an improvement in producers’ gross margin across all scenarios, with some scenarios (Drought Management Plan, Increased Efficiency, and Optimal Allocation) even registering a higher gross margin for irrigated land than the baseline scenario without drought (+4.5 %; +3.2 % and +2.6 %, respectively). However, this increase is not uniform across all crops; rather, the rise in gross margin for certain crops contributes to an overall average producers’ gain throughout the entire basin. Thus, by considering the price effect, the market equilibrium generated in the coupled model attenuates the microeconomic impact of a drought for producers. This improvement in producer surplus translates into a worsening of consumer surplus between 33 and 67 M EUR depending on the scenario. Finally, the Optimal Allocation scenario is the one in which welfare decreases the least (5 M EUR).",

While climate change is altering precipitation patterns and snow cover in High Mountain Asia (HMA), our understanding of ROS patterns and their underlying mechanisms remains limited. This study comprehensively analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution, trends, and potential flood risks associated with ROS (snow water equivalent (SWE) ≥ 1 mm and rainfall ≥ 1 mm) and ROS flood (SWE ≥ 10 mm and rainfall ≥ 10 mm) events in HMA using SWE and ERA5-Land rainfall data. Approximately 37.1% of HMAs have had at least one ROS event during hydrological years from 1979 to 2018 and their frequency increased with elevation. The dominant seasons for ROS production were winter at low altitudes, spring at mid-altitudes, and summer at high altitudes. Trend analysis revealed that lower elevations showed a decline in ROS events attributable to reduced SWE; whereas, higher elevations experienced an increase owing to a shift from snowfall to rainfall. ROS flood events significantly accelerated snowmelt (1.27-times faster than non-ROS events, respectively). ROS flood events, though low-frequent, accounted for 2.52% and 1.55% of the total regional rainfall and snowmelt, respectively, with the main flood risk concentrated in mid-altitude regions around 3.0-4.5 km. This research provides a scientific basis for water resource management, flood prediction, and adaptation in HMA.",

      "abstract": "The societal risks posed by heat waves can be reinforced and magnified during drought conditions. To explore this further in the United States, heat waves and drought events were defined at U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) stations using daily maximum air temperature and weekly time series of the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM). Standardized air temperature and heat index anomalies were evaluated to determine how droughts influenced heat wave duration, intensity, and heat exposure. Overall, compound heat waves had higher levels of heat exposure than noncompound heat waves, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. On average, compound events had 46.9°C more cumulative extreme heat degree hours (EHDHs; degrees Celsius above the 90th percentile) of exposure than noncompound heat waves with a third of USCRN stations having 50°C EHDHs or more. This reduced to 16.4°C EHDHs when heat index was used to define exposure. Increases in compound heat wave exposure were primarily driven by droughts lengthening heat waves (12 h-2 days longer) than by higher air temperature intensity (0.2 standard deviations warmer). Given that 5-cm standardized soil moisture anomalies were found to both vary (wet and dry conditions) within drought events and strongly impact both air temperature and heat index intensity, the muted intensity response to drought may be related to the USDM’s limited response to short-term precipitation events that are sufficient to moisten the soil and impact heat waves, but not ameliorate drought. This highlights the importance of evaluating heat waves at subdaily scales and explicitly accounting for the role of soil moisture in influencing heat wave intensity and exposure. Significance Statement Droughts were found to increase the risk of heat exposure when comparing compound to noncompound heat waves, particularly during the late afternoon to early evening periods. The increased exposure was driven more by droughts lengthening the duration of heat waves rather than increasing their intensity. Soil moisture anomalies provided further clarity on the compounding effect as a more direct measure of deficits important to heat wave evolution than the all-drought-type approach of the U.S. Drought Monitor.",

      "abstract": "Droughts significantly impact terrestrial vegetation ecosystems. Understanding the mechanisms by which drought affects ecosystems under different hydrogeological conditions is crucial for ecosystem protection. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics and mechanisms of propagation from meteorological drought (MD) to agricultural drought (AD) and ecological drought (ED) in the Jinsha River Basin from 2000 to 2014. The monthly standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), soil moisture index (SSMI), normalized difference vegetation index (SNDVI), and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SSIF) data were used to investigate the responses of AD and ED to MD. On the basis of the maximum correlation coefficients (MCCs), the differences in the drought propagation times of MD to AD and ED were explored in positively and negatively correlated areas. A random forest algorithm was used to identify the impacts of climatic factors driving drought propagation. The results revealed that AD was mainly positively correlated with MD, whereas the correlation coefficients between ED and MD ranged from negative to positive. The propagation time from MD to AD was relatively short in summer and autumn. In positively correlated areas, the propagation time from MD to ecological drought indicated by NDVI (EDndvi) was longer than that indicated by SIF (EDsif), and the opposite was true in negatively correlated areas. The random forest algorithm results indicated that temperature (T), solar radiation (S) and precipitation (P) were key factors influencing ED in positively correlated areas and that T was an important factor in controlling the occurrence of ED in negatively correlated areas. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) was more sensitive to MD and had a shorter response time in positively correlated areas, suggesting its potential for monitoring vegetation growth responses to drought. We found that MD was not the main factor influencing vegetation growth in negatively correlated areas. The findings of this study had significant implications for understanding the mechanisms of the response of vegetation growth to MD and offered scientific guidance for maintaining terrestrial ecosystem health.",

      "abstract": "Compound dry and hot extremes (CDHE) have gained a pronounced relevance due to the observed increase in their frequency and the severity of their impacts on natural and human systems. The Orinoco River Basin, an ecoregion of great importance given its high biodiversity and the third largest river basin in South America, is vulnerable to these compound extremes because its extensive savannas are highly prone to fire activity. Here, we analyzed the occurrence of CDHE in this basin during the period 1981-2021. We compared different surface and atmospheric variables during drought periods (dry extremes) and CDHE (defined as periods with abnormally hot conditions during a meteorological drought event). Our results show that CDHE exhibit a larger precipitation deficit than dry extremes, exacerbating the meteorological drought. This stronger precipitation deficit is a response of weaker trade winds transporting moisture toward the region, in addition to stronger mid-tropospheric anticyclonic structures over the north Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea that advect dry air masses, inducing a deficit in total column water vapor and relative humidity at the mid-levels over the Orinoco. The moisture deficit during CDHE is also felt over the landmass, not only at surface but also deep soil layers, exacerbating the agricultural and ecological drought. Moreover, the decreased cloud cover associated with the enhanced precipitation deficit during CDHE increases the solar radiation reaching the surface, raising land temperature and reinforcing the drought impacts. Therefore, fire activity over the basin is enhanced during CDHE, increasing their associated burned area. This is very relevant since the savannas of the Orinoco are highly flammable and prone to fire, being burned with high frequency due to the practice of extensive livestock farming.",

The objective of the work is to generate a fire susceptibility map for central Portugal using the Random Forest method, and to evaluate the importance of variables in the model and select those that contribute most to the accuracy of the susceptibility map. For the model, 13 social or environmental variables and the history of fires in the region were used for fire modeling with Random Forest, where only 10 were considered important for the model. For validation, the Kappa and accuracy of the fire occurrence classification model, Area Under the Curve (AUC), and burned area relative to susceptibility classes were calculated. The best model presented a Kappa of 0.641, AUC of 84.68%, and showed that the burned area increased with the increase in wildfire susceptibility. Population density and firefighter density were the most important variables, while environmental ones proved to be an important support for fire modeling.

      "abstract": "This research developed a composite drought index based on the copula theory, standardized precipitation, evapotranspiration and groundwater Index (SPEGI). SPEGI innovatively integrated surface water variables, that is, precipitation and actual evapotranspiration, and groundwater variables, that is, groundwater water storage changes. Subsequently, it was compared with standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), standardized soil moisture index (SSMI), and standardized groundwater index (SGI), and cross-validated with observed crop yield to validate its applicability. The Tarim River, recognized as China's largest inland river, has its water resources primarily supplied by its headstream. The headstream of the Tarim River Basin (TRB) is increasingly subjected to intense and prolonged droughts under climate change, which serves as the study area. Finally, the study assessed drought characteristics in the headstream of TRB using SPEGI. The results demonstrated that Gaussian copula provided the best fit for constructing joint probability distributions at a 1-month scale, whereas the Gumbel copula was most suitable at the 3-, 6-, and 12-month scales. The SPEGI effectively identified both meteorological and groundwater drought features and demonstrated a better correlation with crop yields compared to SPEI, SSMI, and SGI. Additionally, the drought characteristics in mountainous regions exhibited high frequency, short duration, and low intensity, whereas the plains exhibited low frequency, long duration, and high intensity. This research provided an innovative perspective for drought research, considering both surface water and groundwater and focusing on improved regional drought assessment and strategic development.",

      "abstract": "Accurately predicting sediment dynamics and understanding their intrinsic contributors are pivotal for sustainable environment and water management. While machine learning (ML) enables precise predictions, its “black-box” nature hinders transparency and credibility, posing challenges in interpretability and uncertainty quantification (UQ). To achieve trustworthy ML for riverine sediment timeseries predictions, this study proposes an integrated ML framework, enhancing key steps: feature selection, UQ, and interpretation. Lagged hydro-environmental variables are incorporated via rigorous feature selection. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and conformal prediction are utilized to refine interpretability and UQ, respectively. Based on 41-year multi-source data and three ensemble learning algorithms (LightGBM, XGBoost, and random forest (RF)), this study models daily suspended sediment concentration (SSC) separately for seven subtropical watersheds and evaluates overall and local accuracy. Key findings include: (a) Discharge and precipitation dominate SSC variability (explaining ∼56.8% and ∼18.9% of the variability, respectively). Sampling-day discharge and accumulative lagged precipitation should be prioritized as predictors. Precipitation-discharge interaction effects on SSC exhibit simple threshold effects, whereas the interaction effects of hydrological (precipitation, discharge) and environmental (SPEI, land cover) factors involve complex, bidirectional threshold effects. (b) LightGBM and XGBoost excel in long-term/general prediction, while RF outperform for short-term/extreme value predictions. (c) Conformal prediction-based UQ provides probabilistic information to quantify prediction reliability and efficiency, alongside uncertainty sources: discharge (∼38.9%) > precipitation (∼33.4%) > land cover (∼19.6%) > SPEI (∼8.1%). This framework advances trustworthy ML in riverine sediment modeling, while its algorithm-agnostic design ensures potential scalability to support broader hydrological applications and informed environmental decision-making.",

      "abstract": "Anthropogenic warming has exacerbated atmospheric heatwaves globally, yet the transboundary migration of heatwaves between land and ocean, along with the anthropogenic influence on this process, remain unclear. Here, we employ a Lagrangian tracking approach to identify and track spatiotemporally contiguous warm-season heatwaves in both reanalyses and simulations. This way, we show that land-ocean transboundary heatwaves, especially in the tropics, exhibit longer persistence, wider areal extent, and greater intensity than those confined to land or ocean. These transboundary migrations are primarily driven by the movement of high-pressure systems (such as the westward extension of subtropical highs) and the propagation of Rossby waves. Associated with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, the frequency of tropical heatwave migrations has increased over the past four decades, and is projected to accelerate further in the twenty-first century under the high-emissions scenario. Anthropogenically-driven landward migrations are amplified by stronger landward winds that drive heat advection, while oceanward processes are likely intensified by increased land-ocean temperature gradient. These intensified transboundary heatwaves not only accentuate humid heat risks for humans but also threaten ecosystems.",

This study assesses future changes in daily precipitation quantiles for a set of return periods in the MRBH under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, across short (2015-2045), medium (2045-2075), and long-term (2075-2100). The average projected changes indicate that, in the short term, under the SSP1-2.6 scenario, precipitation quantiles decrease for return periods longer than two years (ranging from 8.17 % to 16.16 %), while a slight increase (0.15 % to 9.97 %) is observed for the 2-year return period at 69 % of the stations. In contrast, the SSP5-8.5 scenario consistently increases across all return periods (ranging from 0.017 % to 26.16 %). In the medium and long terms, both scenarios project an increment in precipitation quantiles. In the medium term, the SSP1-2.6 scenario shows increases ranging from 0.013 % to 37.27 %, while the SSP5-8.5 scenario shows a variation from 0.0093 % to 37.22 %. In the long term, increases range from 0.21 % to 33.38 % under the SSP1-2.6 scenario and from 0.014 % to 66.03 % under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. These findings suggest extreme rainfall events may intensify, leading to more frequent and severe flood events.",

      "abstract": "Wildfire dynamics and their interactions with climatic variables pose significant challenges in Mediterranean ecosystems. This study investigates spatiotemporal wildfire patterns in Campania, southwestern Italy, for the period 2001-2020 during the peak fire season (June-September). Burned area, land cover/use, land surface temperature (LST), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) products of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) as well as the Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) dataset are employed. First, the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator are applied to each land cover/use class within each province. Next, Pearson's correlations among NDVI, LST, and precipitation are estimated at the pixel level, and their interconnections with fire activity are studied at the province level. The results reveal significant declines in grasslands across all provinces, with the strongest (−17.69 km2/year) in Avellino, and increases in grassy woodlands, e.g., +16.51 km2/year in Avellino and + 11.41 km2/year in Benevento. LST shows the strongest positive correlation with burned area in Caserta (r = 0.67), while NDVI correlates negatively with fire, with the highest magnitude in Avellino (r = −0.70). Precipitation-fire relationships are generally weak to moderate and negative, with the strongest in Benevento (r = −0.52). NDVI-LST correlations are significantly negative across all provinces, with the strongest (r = −0.79) in Benevento, highlighting vegetation stress under thermal extremes. To complement the regional assessment, a case study of the 2017 wildfire on Ischia Island is also presented, employing Sentinel-2 imagery for differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) mapping and dynamic world land cover data for detecting short-term post-fire land cover changes. The findings highlight the importance of integrating low to high-resolution satellite images to capture both broad-scale climate-fire interactions and localized fire dynamics, supporting improved wildfire susceptibility assessment in Mediterranean landscapes.",

This method has been widely used for modelling catchment ET and calibrating satellite-based ET algorithms at multi-annual timesteps, as it effectively accounts for how the relationship between water and energy balance changes with climatic aridity. However, substantial deviations from the predictive Budyko curve are observed as the spatiotemporal resolution increases, suggesting that additional environmental controls beside aridity also significantly influence hydrological partitioning over space and time. In this study, we assessed the impact of 14 environmental indicators on hydrological partitioning from the Budyko framework across 45 catchments over central-western Europe. The combination of catchment slope and two climatic factors − cumulative moisture surplus and rainfall erosivity − effectively explained spatial differences in hydrological partitioning (r = 0.83, rRMSE = 11.66 %). Interannual variations in the enhanced vegetation index and the fraction of precipitation falling as snow captured the temporal scatters (r = 0.37, rRMSE = 14.18 %). Based on these findings, we introduced a two-step modification involving a spatial adjustment of curve parameter ( w ) and a temporal correction of curve scatter (α) into the Budyko model, which led to improved ET prediction (Δr = 0.30, ΔRMSE = -21.62 mm yr −1 ) compared to the original framework. The revised Budyko model can be further applied to map ET beyond catchment scale, which facilitates water balance studies at regional scales. The Budyko-predicted ET, independent from existing energy-balance ET (ET EB ) products, can also serve as a macroscale water-balance ET benchmark for satellite-based products in data-scarce regions.",

      "abstract": "Flash droughts-characterized by their rapid onset-can cause devastating socioeconomic and agricultural damage. During such events, soil moisture depletion is driven not only by precipitation shortages but also by the elevated atmospheric moisture demand arising due to extreme heat. However, the role of extreme heat in shaping the evolution of flash droughts and their ecological impacts remains uncertain. Here we investigate the processes involved by analysing global reanalysis data from 1950 to 2022. We find that, when flash droughts are accompanied by extreme heat, they exhibit 6.7-90.8% higher severity and 8.3-114.3% longer recovery time than flash droughts without extreme heat. The presence of extreme heat during flash droughts accelerates soil moisture drawdown over high latitudes, where wet soils and enhanced radiation foster evapotranspiration. By contrast, it slows the absolute onset speed in subtropical transitional climate zones owing to evapotranspiration throttling. Our machine learning approach further reveals that hot flash droughts lead to sharper declines in ecosystem productivity, particularly in croplands, thereby threatening global food security. These findings underscore the pressing need for enhanced infrastructure and ecosystem resilience to hot flash droughts in a warming future.",

      "abstract": "Temporally compounding droughts (TCD), which are usually referred to as consecutive years of droughts or recurrent droughts, can lead to larger impacts on different sectors than those resulting from individual droughts occurring in isolation. Previous investigations of the changes in TCD mostly focused on case studies or selected events. However, systematic assessments of the distribution, propagation, and projection of TCD across the globe are still limited, which hinders the understanding of their risk in a changing climate. In this study, we leveraged annual precipitation and soil moisture from ERA-5 reanalysis products to define different types of TCD, including those based on meteorological droughts (TCD M ) and agricultural droughts (TCD A ), and explored their spatial distributions and propagations during historical periods (1950-2014), followed by future projections (2036-2100) based on model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Several regions, such as southern North America, northern Africa, and Australia, are the hot spots of TCD. In addition, the probability of TCDA conditional on TCDM (as a measure of drought propagation) is higher in southern North America, Africa, and Australia. For the future period, the frequency of short-term TCDM is projected to decrease in large regions across the Northern Hemisphere and increase in certain regions (e.g., northern South America, Mediterranean regions, southern Africa, and Australia). The projected frequency of short-term TCD A based on surface soil moisture shows an increase for the majority of global land areas except for a few regions, such as central Africa and southern Asia. The findings of this study are useful for the impact assessment of droughts and the development of mitigation measures under a changing climate.",

However, there are significant uncertainties in global drought trends 4, 5, 6, and a limited understanding of the extent to which a key driver, atmospheric evaporative demand (AED), impacts the recent evolution of the magnitude, frequency, duration and areal extent of droughts. Here, by developing an ensemble of high-resolution global drought datasets for 1901-2022, we find an increasing trend in drought severity worldwide. Our findings suggest that AED has increased drought severity by an average of 40% globally. Not only are typically dry regions becoming drier but also wet areas are experiencing drying trends. During the past 5 years (2018-2022), the areas in drought have expanded by 74% on average compared with 1981-2017, with AED contributing to 58% of this increase. The year 2022 was record-breaking, with 30% of the global land area affected by moderate and extreme droughts, 42% of which was attributed to increased AED. Our findings indicate that AED has an increasingly important role in driving severe droughts and that this tendency will likely continue under future warming scenarios.",

While basin-level studies have extensively investigated these impacts, regional and global-scale assessments remain limited. Here we use a comprehensive global dataset of river discharge observations to systematically assess the hydrological response to wildfires for a range of hydrologically homogenous world regions and biomes. Our analysis reveals contrasting hydrological impacts by region, with high-latitude discharge ratios declining by 7.5% and 16% in the first and second year after wildfire, respectively, while Northern mid-latitude regions showing a marginal 3.3% median increase in discharge ratio the first-year post-fire. Sub-tropical and equatorial regions display negative and positive effects, respectively. We further discuss how potential ecological and hydroclimatic factors, along with human river and watershed management, shape these diverse hydrological responses per hydroclimatic region.",

      "abstract": "Drylands are important carbon pools for climate change mitigation but remain highly vulnerable to climate and anthropogenic pressures. Despite China hosting one of the largest dryland areas globally, limited studies have quantified its biomass carbon storage and sequestration potential. Here, we divided China's drylands into ecological types and climate zones and employed random forest models to estimate biomass carbon carrying capacity and carbon sequestration potential. The results showed that the carrying capacity of China's drylands is 7.1 Pg C, with ∼4.1 Pg C (∼58%) already stored and an additional 3 Pg C potentially sequesterable. Regions with the highest carbon sequestration potential are concentrated in the eastern part of Inner Mongolia, the Northeast China, the northern part of Xinjiang, and the Huang-huai-hai region. Forests showed the highest total carbon carrying capacity (4.2 Pg C) and carbon sequestration potential (2.1 Pg C), followed by grasslands with a carbon carrying capacity of 2.7 Pg C and sequestration potential of 1.6 Pg C. Carbon sequestration thresholds varied across land use change types and aridity gradients. The identified hotspots in our study where vegetation has not yet reached its full potential should be the main target of future restoration projects. It should be noted that these estimates are based on historical climate conditions and land cover patterns, and may vary under future climate change and land use transitions. Therefore, these figures should be interpreted as conditional estimates, reflecting the limitations of using static climatic baselines.",

The data are divided into different periods: the first period (FP) between 1970 and 1996, the second period (SP) between 1997 and 2022, and all period (AP) between 1970 and 2022 to assess the change in meteorological drought in the region from the past to the present. Applying the run theory to the SPI series obtained in these periods, duration, severity, intensity, and peak values are calculated for wet and dry conditions. The Mann-Kendall (MK), Spearman-Rho (SR), and Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) methods are applied to ascertain the change in the spatial occurrence of drought classes. The study reveals that drought exhibits distinct characteristics and occurrence rates in different regions of the study area, with notable differences between the western and eastern regions. The study region exhibits considerable variability in average duration and severity. The results indicated that extreme and severe drought-wet conditions have increased again after a 30-year interval. Furthermore, it is determined that the region is experiencing significant shifts in extreme wet and dry conditions and extreme events related to flooding and drought.",

The prevailing large-scale evapotranspiration models usually rely on remotely-sensed meteorological conditions and terrestrial properties. In recent years, Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) has shown great potential in estimating transpiration, providing a new way for evapotranspiration estimation. In this study, we developed a transpiration model based on the water-carbon coupling theory by using remotely sensed SIF. Then we adopted different evaporation models to achieve the estimation of total ET using the two-source scheme. The performances of the proposed ET models were evaluated at 51 forest sites in FLUXNET2015 database. We found that the ET models we proposed generally perform well, but the different evaporation models largely determine the overall performance of ET models. In particular, the best-performing model − ET(SIF + PT) achieves a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 17.8 W m −2 and a Bias of −4.1 W m −2 by combining SIF-based transpiration model and an improved evaporation module based on the Priestley-Taylor model. The generally good performance of the ET model we proposed underscores the potential of using SIF to estimate forest evapotranspiration",

      "abstract": "Anthropogenic influence have led to an increase in the frequency of compound dry and hot events (CDHEs) globally under the background of global warming. However, there is limited research on the extent of anthropogenic influence on the spatial extent of CDHEs. Our analysis, focusing on the changes in the affected area of CDHEs across the global land during the warm season from 1961 to 2013, indicates an increasing trend in both hemispheres and six continents, with the most obviously increases observed in the Northern Hemisphere (15.8 %/53 yr), Asia (16 %/53 yr), and Africa (14 %/53 yr). Using the optimal fingerprinting method for detection and attribution analysis, we found that the anthropogenic signal was robustly detected in all regions except Oceania. The greenhouse gases emission played a major role in the observed increasing trends in all regions except Oceania. Furthermore, we conducted an event attribution analysis for the 2022 CHDEs areas in the Northern Hemisphere, finding that nearly 95 %, 91 %, and 89 % of the trends in the Northern Hemisphere, Asia, and Europe, respectively, could be attributed to anthropogenic climate change. Using the attribution result, we constrained projections of spatial extent of CDHEs under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 emission scenarios. The constrained projections show a smaller increasing magnitude compared to the raw projections (except for Asia), with the largest differences observed in South America in the Southern Hemisphere. By 2100, the CDHEs areas in the Northern Hemisphere is projected to reach 43 % and 68 % under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively. Asia faces the most widespread impact from CHDEs, with more than 93 % under the SSP5-8.5 scenario and 56 % under the SSP2-4.5 scenario. Therefore, reducing greenhouse gas emissions has huge benefits for better mitigating the impacts of CDHEs across the global land.",

      "abstract": "Climate-related extreme events impose a heavy toll on humankind, and many will likely become more frequent in the future. The compound (joint) occurrence of different climate-related hazards and impacts can further exacerbate the detrimental consequences for society. By analyzing postprocessed data from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project, we provide a global mapping of future changes in the compound occurrence of six categories of hazards or impacts related to climate extremes. These are: river floods, droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, tropical cyclone-induced winds and crop failures. In line with the existing literature, we find sharp increases in the occurrence of many individual hazards and impacts, notably heatwaves and wildfires. Under a medium-high emission scenario, many regions worldwide transition from chiefly experiencing a given category of hazard or impact in isolation to routinely experiencing compound hazard or impact occurrences. A similarly striking change is projected for the future recurrence of compound hazards or impacts, with many locations experiencing specific compound occurrences at least once a year for several years, or even decades, in a row. In the absence of effective global climate mitigation actions, we may thus witness a qualitative regime shift from a world dominated by individual climate-related hazards and impacts to one where compound occurrences become the norm.",

This study investigates the interrelationships among climatic, geographic, soil, and anthropogenic factors influencing drought risk in the Upper Phetchaburi River Basin. Ten key drought risk factors-precipitation, aridity index, slope, elevation, soil texture, drainage, fertility, erosion, land use, and land cover-were spatially analyzed using Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering and Pearson Product-Moment Correlation. The analysis revealed both direct and inverse relationships among these variables, underscoring the compounded effects of climate, land use, and soil dynamics on drought vulnerability. A particularly strong correlation between climatic and anthropogenic variables suggests a spatial-temporal alignment that intensifies drought conditions. Additional significant correlations-including precipitation-aridity index, aridity index-land use, and slope-soil fertility-further emphasize the integrated nature of environmental processes regulating drought susceptibility. Clustering analysis identified three distinct groups: (1) precipitation, aridity index, and soil erosion, illustrating how reductions in precipitation and aridity index accelerate soil degradation; (2) soil properties-texture, drainage, and fertility-highlighting their roles in water retention, nutrient availability, and vegetation resilience; and (3) elevation, land use, and land cover, demonstrating the combined effects of topography and anthropogenic activities on drought dynamics. These findings underscore the urgent need for sustainable land management, targeted ecosystem restoration, and climate-adaptive policies to mitigate drought risks. By elucidating localized drought drivers within broader environmental contexts, this study offers a transferable framework for informing proactive, cross-disciplinary drought mitigation strategies.",

However, accurate retrieval of non-optically active water quality parameters (NAWQPs) remains challenging due to their weak spectral responses and interference from diverse aquatic vegetation. In this study, we proposed a novel zoning-based ensemble modeling strategy (ZBEMS) by integrating aquatic vegetation classification with hyperspectral features derived from ZY-1 02D images, and tested it in Nansi Lake to retrieve NAWQPs (ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and dissolved oxygen (DO)). Firstly, diverse aquatic vegetation was identified using aquatic vegetation index (AVI), floating algae index (FAI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the dominant type within each 3 × 3 Km grid determined vegetation zones (floating emergent vegetation (FEVA), submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), and algae bloom (AB)). Secondly, multi-spectral scale morphological combination features (MSMCF) were extracted from the ZY-1 02D images. Finally, the ZBEMS integrating four machine learning models (Random Forest Regression (RFR), Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Regression (SVR)) was applied across different zones for NAWQPs retrieval. Within the sampling area, the model achieved R 2 values of 0.56, 0.54, and 0.57 and root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.04 mg/L, 4.56 mg/L, and 1.87 mg/L for retrieval of NH 3 -N, COD, and DO, respectively. Compared with traditional ensemble learning models, ZBEMS model improved the R 2 by approximately 0.13 for three parameters. These results indicate that the ZBEMS offers a promising approach for NAWQPs retrieval in complex aquatic environments.",

Yet, little is known about ecological and social impacts of such interventions in the context of socio-ecological framework and environmental justice. Here, we used a quantitative and spatial analytical approach to assess the changes of urban greenspace (UG) and examine the equity of changes in ES supply and demand across demographic and socioeconomic groups in Beijing and NYC between 2010 and 2017. Results showed that previously existing green space and its expansion were unevenly distributed across districts. High-income districts in NYC had high green cover and experienced the highest increase of UG, in contrast to high green cover in areas with low population density and the greatest increase of UG in high-income areas for Beijing, respectively. The inequitable distribution of UG resulted in a high level of mismatch in supply demand of ES, revealing a pattern of distributional ecological injustice within city. We also found more ecological supply was provided in the areas having less vulnerability, indicating that social vulnerability remained in a lower greenspace exposure after greening implementation in both cities. Our study contributes to a better understanding on how the dynamics of urban greenspace impact urban climate injustices, and provides new insights for critical urban adaptation interventions or practice on shaping ecological injustice.",

      "abstract": "Drought-Flood Abrupt Alternation (DFAA) events are complex hydrometeorological disasters that have become increasingly frequent under global warming, posing significant threats to socio-economic systems and the ecological stability. This study applies the Standardized Weighted Average Precipitation (SWAP) index to identify DFAA events at a daily scale in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (MLRYRB) from 2001 to 2022. Additionally, a method is proposed to analyze the driving factors of DFAA and quantify the spatial distribution of dominant contributors. The results indicate that: (1) in the MLRYRB, DFAA events lasted up to 50 days and occurred 7 to 10 times in total, with the highest frequency in southern Shaanxi, central Hubei, central Anhui, and southern Jiangxi; (2) the areas affected by DTF and FTD events decreased at rates of 0.43/a and 0.62/a, respectively. DTF events were predominantly moderate in intensity, while FTD events were mostly slight; (3) the key factors driving drought-flood alternation included convective precipitation (CP), total cloud cover (TCC), top net solar radiation (TNSR), 2-m temperature (TEM), and relative humidity (RH). Regions dominated by RH and TEM accounted for 44.62 % and 30.22 % of the study area, respectively, mainly in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui. These findings offer a scientific basis for developing disaster prevention and mitigation strategies in the region.",

      "abstract": "If renewable energy resources continue to become a larger part of the generation mix in the United States (U.S.), so does the potential impact of prolonged periods of low wind and solar generation, known as variable renewable energy (VRE) droughts. In such a future, naturally occurring VRE droughts need to be evaluated for their potential impact on grid reliability. This study is the first of its kind to examine the impacts of compound VRE energy droughts in the Western U.S. across a range of potential future climate and infrastructure scenarios. We find that compound VRE drought severity may increase significantly in the future, primarily due to the dramatic increase in wind and solar generation needed in some future infrastructure scenarios. We find that in our future climate scenario, the variability of energy drought severity increases, which has implications for sizing energy storage necessary for mitigating drought events. We also examine the spatial patterns of compound VRE drought events that effect multiple regions of the grid simultaneously. These co-occurring events have distinct spatial patterns depending on the season. We observed overall fewer connected events in the future with the combined effect of potential climate and infrastructure changes, although in the fall we observe a climate-induced shift toward events which impact more regions simultaneously.",

Study focus The study develops the Standardized Reservoir Index (SRI) for analyzing reservoir droughts using the standardization technique. Also, the copula analysis was conducted to calculate joint probabilities and return periods of drought characteristics, i.e., duration and severity. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and SRI time series were analyzed with the Sustainability Index (SI) to capture the anthropogenic impact on drought exacerbation. New hydrological insights for the region The results reveal a 7- to 9-month lag time to propagate from meteorological drought (SPI) to hydrological drought (SRI). A comparison of SPI and SRI shows a significant SI decrease between 2 % and 13 %, highlighting anthropogenic impacts on drought exacerbation. Examination of the precipitation trend using the modified Mann-Kendall test also shows an insignificant trend at the 5 % significance level. The copulas were fitted with high accuracy, with Nash Sutcliffe efficiency values between 0.9 and 1, and root mean square error below 0.16. The results indicate that, from the perspective of the OR state, exacerbated hydrological droughts are detectable in the investigated reservoirs. The average probability of occurrence was 42 % for meteorological droughts and 46 % for hydrological droughts, for different severity and duration values.",

      "abstract": "Dual-source remotely sensed evapotranspiration (ET) models require accurate separation of soil evaporation (Es), plant transpiration (Ec), and precipitation interception (Ei) based on soil and canopy resistances. Despite the availability of several ET products and algorithms, comprehensive evaluations of resistance configurations remain scarce. This study systematically evaluates various combinations of five soil resistance methods, eight canopy resistance methods, and two precipitation interception algorithms within the Shuttleworth-Wallace (S-W) framework. Using eddy covariance data from 119 FLUXNET sites and the latest ET products, we find that the Ball-Berry-Leuning method, unified stomatal method, and RL empirical method provide comparable and top-ranked performance across plant functional types (PFTs) and climate zones, with only a single free parameter calibrated by genetic algorithm. The power function method (S2), sensitive to soil surface water content proves to be the most effective for modeling Es, particularly in water-limited regions. The performance of best-performing but unexplored combinations (S2-C1, S2-C2, S2-C5) is consistent with PML-V2, GLEAM4, and underlying water use efficiency model, explaining 56% of the variation in daily ET and achieving an root mean square error as low as 1.02 mm day −1 . However, these models show reduced accuracy in arid zones, where prolonged water stress led to a 38% reduction in R 2 . This highlights the need for a more accurate representation of soil moisture stress in arid regions, which is often overlooked in existing models. Our study offers robust, parsimonious, and broadly applicable models for ET estimation across PFTs and climate zones.",

Yet, there remains limited research at the global scale analyzing how half of the annual precipitation falls predominantly on these days. Therefore, we leveraged five of the most notable satellite precipitation products (SPPs) to map the number of wettest days that account for 50% of annual precipitation (WD50) across all oceans and landmasses. We found substantial differences in WD50 between SPPs and further evaluated their ability to capture spatial patterns accurately. Out of the SPPs studied, data from the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement aligned most closely with rain-gauge measurements. This research also revealed substantial variability in WD50 across reference climate regions, shedding new lights onto the global distribution of WD50-a variable particularly relevant for water resources planning as precipitation regimes are projected to become more unevenly distributed in the future.",

However, whether UHI trends have shifted recently and their underlying drivers remain unknown. Here we investigate the variabilities in surface UHI trends and their associated determinants in 2,104 cities worldwide from 2000 to 2022. Our findings reveal that approximately half of the world's cities have experienced notable shifts in surface UHI trends, predominantly characterized by UHI deceleration. These shifts can be primarily attributed to alterations in vegetation trends during the day and to modifications in surface albedo and local warming trends at night. Our study challenges the conventional linear models commonly employed to estimate surface UHI trends, suggesting potential biases in such estimates. Our findings underscore the need for nuanced policies to curtail UHI growth by considering changes in urban underlying surfaces and background climate, particularly from a nonlinear perspective.",

      "abstract": "Using various observations and a chemistry-climate model, this study investigates the impact of wintertime total column ozone (TCO) on snow cover over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The results indicate that during anomalously high TP TCO events, the snow cover on the TP is anomalously high, and vice versa. Further analysis reveals that high TP TCO leads to a warmer stratosphere and a colder troposphere. The stratospheric warming induces lower geopotential height in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) over the TP. The cyclonic circulation in the UTLS associated with this low-pressure leads to high-potential vorticity (PV) stratospheric air being transported to the western TP. To maintain the conservation of PV, cyclonic vorticity forms above the western TP in the UTLS and can extend into the troposphere, then transporting water vapor from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea to the TP. The southerlies associated with this cyclonic circulation and positive vertical gradient of zonal wind in the troposphere induce ascending motions over the TP. Increased water vapor and ascending motions lead to more snowfall and cloud formation. The increased cloud enhances the cooling of the TP, leading to condensation process in the southern boundary of the TP and lower geopotential height in the UTLS over the TP. This decreased geopotential height strengthens the snowfall process. The increased snow cover in turn causes a cooling of the TP surface. This positive feedback further amplifies the snow cover variation. Model simulations suggest that a change of 10 DU in TCO can result in a 1.7% change in snow cover.",

      "abstract": "Understanding long-term terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations is vital for investigating hydrological extreme events, managing water resources and assessing climate change impacts. However, the limited data duration from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on mission (GRACE-FO) poses challenges for comprehensive long-term analysis. In this study, we reconstruct TWS anomalies (TWSAs) for the period from January 1960 to December 2022, thereby filling data gaps between the GRACE and GRACE-FO missions and generating a complete dataset for the pre-GRACE era. The workflow involves identifying optimal predictors from land surface model (LSM) outputs, meteorological variables and climatic indices using a novel Bayesian network (BN) technique for raster-based TWSA simulations. Climate indices, like the Oceanic Niño Index and Dipole Mode Index, are selected as optimal predictors for a large number of grid cells globally, along with TWSAs from LSM outputs. The most effective machine learning (ML) algorithms among convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector regression (SVR), extra trees regressor (ETR) and stacking ensemble regression (SER) models are evaluated at each grid cell to achieve optimal reproducibility. Globally, ETR performs best for most of the grid cells; this is also noticed at the river basin scale, particularly for the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna, Godavari, Krishna, Limpopo and Nile river basins. The simulated TWSAs (BNML_TWSA) outperformed the TWSAs from LSM outputs when evaluated against GRACE datasets. Improvements are particularly noted in river basins such as the Godavari, Krishna, Danube and Amazon, with median correlation coefficient, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, and RMSE values for all grid cells in the Godavari Basin, India, being 0.927, 0.839 and 63.7 mm, respectively. A comparison with TWSAs reconstructed in recent studies indicates that the proposed BNML_TWSA outperforms them globally as well as for all of the 11 major river basins examined. Furthermore, the uncertainty of BNML_TWSA is assessed for each grid cell in terms of the standard error. Results show smaller standard error magnitudes in grid cells in arid regions compared to other regions. The presented gridded dataset is published at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25376695 , featuring a spatial resolution of 0.50° 0.50° and offering global coverage.",

      "abstract": "Heatwaves are intensifying globally due to climate change. However, the contributions of large-scale atmospheric processes and land-atmosphere interactions to heatwave dynamics and their cascading impacts on water resources and human exposure are not fully understood. This study investigates heatwave frequency (HWF) across 50 global regions, spanning historical (1979-2014) and future periods (2025-2060 and 2065-2100) under SSP 370 (regional rivalry) and SSP 585 (fossil-fuel development) scenarios. Using bias-corrected general circulation model simulations and reconstructed terrestrial water storage (TWS) data, we quantify the contributions of atmospheric processes to HWF modulation and assess the impacts of HWF and temperature changes on water storage deficits using TWS drought severity index (TWS-DSI) and standardized temperature index (STI). We show that Western Central Asia exhibits moisture divergence driven by significant positive thermodynamic effects, which correlates with increased HWF. In West Africa, moisture flux divergence at 1,000 hPa accounts for 45% of HWF variability, while relative humidity at 300 hPa explains 58% of HWF changes in East Asia. HWF and STI strongly influence TWS-DSI, with high STI intensifying TWS deficits. Concurrent high HWF and wet conditions in Western North America are linked to atmospheric blocking and hydrological persistence, highlighting complex illative mechanisms. We project population exposure to HWF to rise tenfold globally by 2100, with regions such as South Asia experiencing over 100% increases due to combined climate and population effects. These findings emphasize the need for tailored adaptation strategies to mitigate heatwave impacts and ensure resilience in a warming world.",

      "abstract": "Previous analyses identified large-scale climatic patterns contributing to greater fuel aridity as drivers of recent dramatic increases in wildfire activity throughout California. This study revisits an approach to investigate more local fire weather patterns in the northern Sierra Nevada; a region within California that has experienced exceptionally high wildfire activity recently. The annual percentages of fire season days above 90th and 95th percentile Energy Release Component (ERC) values were very low prior to 1994 (Fig. 3). Since 1994, years with noticeable percentages of exceedances (>20 %) occurred more frequently. However, neither the highest nor second highest annual exceedances occurred after 2012. Starting in the late 1990s and early 2000s there was a decreasing trend in number of fire season days below the 80th and 50th percentile ERC thresholds. Linear trend lines indicated strongly negative declines throughout the study period. The most likely impact of these declines is on the effectiveness of fire suppression, which rely on low to moderate fire weather to “gain ground” on containment. That said, even the combination of both fire weather conditions (greater high fire weather days and lesser low fire weather days) provides an imperfect explanation for the recent increases in burned area. Additional influences, such as dense forest structures, greater fuel continuity, and ignitions (both number and timing of) are likely contributing as well.",

Franco) conifer stands, aged from about 125 to 500+ years, along an elevational gradient in western Oregon, USA based on periodic mortality surveys. Tree mortality increased from 2000 to 2023, a prolonged period of drought and warming. Soil moisture, air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were the key climatic predictors of tree mortality for all sites, species, and canopy classes based on logistic regression modeling. Increasing trends in annual probability of mortality were associated with decreasing summer available soil water and increasing summer temperature and associated VPD. These trends were most pronounced at mid-elevation (∼600 m) sites west of the Cascade crest, and they were higher for small diameter trees in suppressed and intermediate canopy class positions compared with co-dominant and dominant trees for all sites and species. Competition exacerbated the climate effects on mortality of small trees at drier sites. Insect-induced mortality was evident in large Douglas-fir following prolonged drought and high summer temperatures. In recent decades, long-term soil drying associated with warming temperatures appears to underlie tree mortality in these mesic forests of western Oregon.",

      "abstract": "Drought significantly impacts plant carbon uptake, a critical process for regulating atmospheric CO 2 . With the intensification of droughts under climate change, understanding ecosystem responses to these events is essential. In this study, we analyzed the impacts of droughts on Net Primary Productivity (NPP) in India over the 21st century. We tested two hypotheses: (a) increasing drought intensity and frequency will exacerbate NPP reductions, and (b) climate warming will diminish ecosystem resilience, leading to greater NPP reductions per drought event. To evaluate ecosystem responses, we employed a Multi-Dimensional Resilience Index (MDRI), which integrates resistance and recovery time to quantify resilience. Our analysis revealed a substantial increase in extreme and moderate droughts, while mild droughts remained stable. Extreme droughts were projected to cause NPP reductions three times greater under the SSP2-4.5 scenario and six times greater under the SSP5-8.5 scenario compared to the baseline period (1850-2014). Ecosystems in the Western Ghats and lower Himalayan regions demonstrated moderate resilience due to prolonged recovery times and moderate resistance. Conversely, ecosystems in Northeastern India exhibited high resilience, characterized by strong resistance and shorter recovery periods. Interestingly, while resistance exhibited an increasing trend, likely influenced by carbon fertilization, recovery times showed a declining trend, potentially linked to rising temperatures. These findings do not support the second hypothesis, as no significant changes in overall ecosystem resilience were observed due to compensatory effects between resistance and recovery. This study can inform conservation strategies aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts of drought on carbon cycling.",

      "abstract": "Improving our understanding of terrestrial carbon-water coupling processes at the basin scale is crucial for assessing the impacts of global change on river basin's ecosystem services. Supported by remote sensing technology, previous studies have investigated the variability of carbon sequestration or water yield of a basin separately. However, the integration of these two components in an assessment system has rarely been considered, which may lead to partial appraisals of eco-hydrological services. To address this knowledge gap, we have developed a new remotely sensed index, the Carbon-Water Efficiency Index (CWEI), which is derived as the product of the normalized precipitation use efficiency (PUE) and water yield efficiency (WYE) during a specified period for a given basin, to quantify the coupling carbon-water ecosystem service. In this study, the spatial and temporal variabilities of CWEI were investigated using satellite-based products across the 38 major river basins from 1982 to 2016. Furthermore, the response patterns of CWEI to its components were explored, and the contributions of the three variables (i.e., temperature, precipitation, vegetation coverage) on changes in CWEI were quantified for each of the basins. The results demonstrated that the CWEI exhibited an increase in 31.6% of the world's major river basins, of which 83.3% with an increasing CWEI demonstrated a response pattern of increasing PUE and decreasing WYE. Furthermore, temperature was identified as the primary contributor to CWEI in 50% of the basins. It is noteworthy that green hotspot basins, where afforestation projects were underway, exhibited enhancements in reduced water yield pressure and demonstrable benefits to local ecohydrology. The proposed CWEI provides a new framework for comprehending the sustainable development of river basins worldwide.",

      "abstract": "Drought affects the health of natural and socio-ecological systems by altering green water evapotranspiration and blue water runoff. However, the global patterns of green and blue water responses to drought remain unclear. Here we quantified drought using root-zone soil moisture reductions and examined the resulting water deficits across different climatic and vegetation conditions. We show that drought generally reduces both evapotranspiration and runoff globally, though with pronounced spatiotemporal variability. In high-latitude humid regions, drought can initially enhance evapotranspiration, whereas runoff responds more rapidly and declines consistently throughout drought periods. Furthermore, drought reduces runoff more than evapotranspiration in humid regions, but the reverse pattern occurs in arid regions. Compared to other vegetation types, forests exhibit smaller drought-induced reductions in evapotranspiration but greater reductions in runoff. These results underscore the importance of considering background climate and vegetation when assessing drought’s hydrological impacts, with important implications for ecohydrological understanding and water resource management.",

      "abstract": "Extreme precipitation events represent critical manifestations of climate variability and are profoundly influenced by intense water vapor transport, a key source and driver of these phenomena. The Tibetan Plateau (TP), often termed the “Third Pole,” serves as a crucial water source for Asia’s major rivers and is highly sensitive to climatic fluctuations. This study investigates the spatiotemporal characteristics and joint probability of concurrent extreme precipitation and water vapor transport events over the TP from 1979 to 2018. Utilizing copula functions, we estimate the joint and conditional probabilities of extreme precipitation and integrated vapor transport (IVT). Correlations between major climate indicators and these extreme events were analyzed, including the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), Nino 3.4 SST Index (Nino), and the Thermal Contrast Index (TCI) between the TP and the Indian Ocean, and simulations with the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model revealed water vapor pathways for 103 extreme events. The results indicate: (1) Extreme precipitation and water vapor flux indices exhibit spatial gradients and overall upward trends, with high values concentrated in the southeastern TP. (2) The central and northeastern regions of the TP exhibit strong coupling. Conditional probabilities highlight significantly higher risks of extreme precipitation in the western and central TP under specific IVT thresholds. (3) Climate indices demonstrate regional variability in their influence, with IOD and Nino generally suppressing water vapor transport, while TCI enhances it. (4) Extreme event water vapor sources exhibit spatial heterogeneity, driven by large-scale circulations such as westerlies and monsoons. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms driving extreme weather in complex terrains, offering a framework for improved risk assessment and climate adaptation strategies.",

      "abstract": "Soil erosion is a major environmental problem with significant impacts on land degradation. This study’s main objective was to determine the effect of different cover-management factor ( C -factor) values on soil erosion estimates with varying proportions of land use types. This effect was demonstrated in a mountain catchment, located in the Polish Carpathians, over two time periods (1977 and 2019), reflecting differing land use and land cover (LULC) influenced by political and socioeconomic changes, particularly after the collapse of communism. The LULC changes in the studied catchment, including an increase in forest area and a decrease in cultivated land, represent broader regional trends within the Carpathian Mountains. The Revised Universal Soil Erosion Equation was used to estimate soil erosion. The model was validated using 30 years of stationary measurements from experimental plots on Carpathian slopes. This study investigated four different C -factor variants, including values derived from previous remote sensing-based European studies and local long-term field data, to comprehensively assess their impact on soil erosion estimates. This study’s results show how the proportion of each LULC type changes the estimated soil erosion values at different C -factors. The average differences in soil erosion between the four C -factor variants were up to 41 % in 1977 and over 96 % in 2019. These contrasts are due to significant differences in the C -factor in all variants, especially for grassland, forests and cultivated land, the areas of which changed significantly over the studied period. The results of this comparison should be considered in soil erosion analyses and guide the selection of appropriate C -factor values, especially in areas where detailed data are unavailable. Overall, this analysis showed that C -factor selection is crucial for determining soil erosion values and that land use structure plays an important role in soil erosion dynamics and sustainable development. Based on this study’s results, specific recommendations for land use management and conservation strategies are proposed. To mitigate soil erosion, afforestation efforts should be prioritised on steeper slopes, while permanent grassland cover should be maintained in areas prone to surface runoff.",

In this study, we use an analytical approach to investigate the role of VPD in the depletion of soil moisture through evapotranspiration (ET) and evaluate if the anomalies reflect its actual contribution toward drying. We model the energy and water balance of the land and lower atmosphere using a simplified slab model and use the energy and water balance equations of the model to decompose the daily changes in soil moisture during flash droughts into those caused by external forcings such as precipitation, wind and radiation on a day and the system response driven by the initial conditions of ground temperature, air temperature, soil moisture and specific humidity on the day. We apply this approach to investigate the role of VPD in ET-driven soil moisture depletion in 10 major watersheds of India. Contrary to previous studies, we find negligible contribution of VPD toward soil moisture depletion in humid regions and high contribution in arid regions. In arid regions, even low anomalies of VPD can contribute significantly to soil moisture depletion due to the large magnitude of VPD, whereas in humid regions even large VPD anomalies do not lead to significant impact on soil moisture depletion. Our results show that the influence of VPD is underestimated in arid regions and overestimated in humid regions in previous studies which have used VPD anomaly based metrics for quantifying its effect on flash droughts.",

Conventional E p estimates-such as the reference evapotranspiration (E ref ) derived from the Penman-Monteith equation-assume fixed vegetation properties, thereby neglecting dynamic physiological responses to elevated CO 2 (eCO 2 ) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). In this work, we extended recent E p formulations by transitioning from a big-leaf to a two-source framework that separately represents vegetation and bare soil, explicitly capturing the effects of Earth’s greening and dynamic stomatal responses to eCO 2 and VPD. Using global datasets, we generated ratios of actual evapotranspiration (E) to E p for historical (1985-2020) and future (2021-2100) periods under multiple CO 2 emission scenarios. The E/E p ratios were converted into the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) and compared with the standardized soil moisture index (SSI). Results showed that, in agricultural regions, the refined E p formulations exhibited gentler upward trends compared to E ref -primarily due to the moderating influence of increased stomatal resistance (r s ) under rising VPD. Future projections further suggested that r s responses to eCO 2 and VPD might partially offset increases in E p , implying that future plant water stress may be less severe than conventional indices predicted. Nonetheless, persistent discrepancies between ESI and SSI projections underscore the critical role of non-meteorological drivers in shaping future evaporative demand and highlight the need for further research to resolve the remaining uncertainties.",

      "abstract": "Drought phenomena exhibit three-dimensional spatiotemporal propagation patterns, often impacting vast regions and lasting for extended periods. Quantifying these spatial and temporal dynamics is essential for understanding their progression and underlying causes. However, there is a lack of studies investigating the spatiotemporal progression and migration of major drought events. In this study, we employed the Spatio-temporal Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (ST-DBSCAN) clustering method to identify significant drought events across the Contiguous United States (CONUS) from 1901 to 2022. This algorithm effectively identifies clusters of arbitrary shapes within a specified three-dimensional space. By tracking the centroids of these drought clusters, we analyzed the progressive development and migration pathways of these events. Our findings indicate that the Great Plains region acts as a key migration corridor, experiencing a higher frequency of drought events compared to other areas in the CONUS. We observed that droughts can travel hundreds of kilometers, gradually intensifying before eventually dissipating. Moreover, a significant linear relationship exists between migration distances and the duration of droughts. Moreover, over 77% of the analyzed drought events exhibited notable spatial shifts, suggesting that the majority of these events migrated across different regions instead of staying confined to a single area. Furthermore, we identified two primary migration patterns for these drought clusters: eastward and westward movements. These findings offer crucial spatiotemporal frameworks for studying the migration process and provide valuable insights for predicting drought occurrences.",

In this study, a distributed climate-water-ecology-economy (CWEE) comprehensive water demand model was established to estimate the spatial and temporal changes in socio-economic and ecological water demand. Annual and seasonal changes in water scarcity levels were spatially analyzed in Xinjiang. Subsequently, the logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) method was employed to decompose the contributions of three major impact factors to changes in water scarcity. The results indicated that the socio-economic water demand in Xinjiang increased significantly, with a 110% increase (1989-2017). The water scarcity index (WSI) showed an increasing trend in fluctuation, which was between 0.29 and 0.42 with a predominant moderate water scarcity before 2007 and higher than 0.5 with severe water scarcity after 2007. Monthly water scarcity was prominent in some basins. The improvement in water use efficiency helped to reduce socio-economic water demand. However, the sharp expansion of the planting scale and changes in the crop structure have led to a significant increase in socio-economic water demand (with agricultural water demand contributing over 93%), emerging as the primary factors exacerbating water scarcity. Therefore, controlling the crop planting scale, reasonably arranging the crop structure, and developing agricultural water-saving technologies are the main measures to relieve water scarcity and realize sustainable development in Xinjiang.",

      "abstract": "Freshwater resources are fundamental to supporting humanity, and measures of water scarcity have been critical for identifying where water requirements and water availability are imbalanced. Existing water scarcity metrics typically account for blue water withdrawals (i.e., from surface-/groundwater), while the contribution of green water (i.e., soil moisture) and water quality-dimensions with important implications for multiple societal sectors-to water scarcity remains unclear. Here, we introduce the concept of multidimensional water scarcity that explicitly assesses all three of these dimensions of water scarcity and evaluates their individual and combined effects. We find that 22 to 26% of the global land area and 58 to 64% of the global population are exposed to some form of water scarcity annually, with multidimensional (i.e., blue, green, and quality) water scarcity particularly high in India, China, and Pakistan. Examining seasonal water scarcity, we estimate that 5.9 billion people (or 80% of the world’s population in 2015) were exposed to at least one dimension of water scarcity for at least 1 mo per year and that 1-in-10 people (10%) were exposed to multidimensional water scarcity at least 1 mo per year. Our findings demonstrate that the challenges of water scarcity are far more widespread than previously understood. As such, our assessment provides a more holistic view of global water scarcity issues and points to overlooked scarcity where action needs to bring human pressure on freshwater resources into balance with water quantity and quality.",

Aims To examine future landscape patterns in fuel hazard and availability across a broad climate- to fuel-limited gradient of native vegetation. Methods We used six future climate projections to predict fuel hazard (proxy for fuel load and structure) and fuel availability (using vapour pressure deficit) across 11 bioregions in Victoria, Australia. We evaluated shifts in fuel hazard ratings and fuel availability between two time periods: 2020-2039 and 2080-2099. Key results The greatest shifts in fuel hazard were increases in near-surface and elevated fuel in ecosystems closer to the middle of the climate- to fuel-limited gradient. Fuel hazard was not predicted to change in the most climate-limited areas but predicted increases in vapour pressure deficit indicated more frequent availability to burn. Conclusions Global climatic change will likely shift landscape fuel patterns, and any changes will vary depending on an ecosystem’s position along fuel- to climate-limited gradients. Implications Fuel management will need to consider the risks associated shifting patterns of fuel hazard and availability with the acknowledgement that risk is changing under changing climates.",

This study employs seven regional climate models from the Land Use and Climate Across Scales project under the EURO-CORDEX framework to investigate deforestation’s effect on multi time scale droughts across Europe using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Simulations contrast idealized scenarios of maximum forest cover and grassland to evaluate climatological responses. The multi-model median results reveal intensified droughts post-deforestation, especially in northern Europe for long-term droughts at the 24-month scale (SPEI24 decrease of approximately 0.5). Pronounced seasonal variability emerges: winter drying (SPEI01 reduction of ∼0.3) and summer wetting (SPEI01 increase of ∼0.25) in Scandinavia, driven largely by shifts in potential evapotranspiration rather than precipitation. Model discrepancies underscore that employing multiple models under a unified framework and protocol reduces extreme or biased outcomes in assessing multi-time scale drought responses to land cover change, compared to reliance on single-model analyses. Regional contrasts underscore heightened drought risks in water-limited Mediterranean areas compared to seasonally modulated impacts in northern Europe. These findings advocate the need for region-specific land management strategies to mitigate climate risks and inform policies addressing forest change biophysical consequences in Europe.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the variability and causes of extreme precipitation events is critical for effective climate risk management and adaptation to climate change. Although previous studies rely on extreme precipitation indices, they either exceed a certain absolute threshold or are based on the chance of a given quantity occurring, ignoring the inequality of projected extreme precipitation events. To fill in the gaps, this study used a group of thirteen bias-corrected CMIP6 GCMs to predict differences in extreme precipitation levels for the near future (2021-2060) and far future (2061-2100), using two common socioeconomic pathways (SSPs): SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 compared to the current period (1985-2014). The current study aims to evaluate future spatiotemporal inequality in the MME mean of extreme rainfall indices across Bangladesh using Gini coefficients (GCs) and their plausible causes of inequality in the precipitation system. The results indicated a varying increase in precipitation inequality in the near and far future compared to the baseline. In the near future, the northern region shows a significant spike in precipitation inequality (GC= 0.24), while the far future shows a slightly reduced inequality (GC= 0.22). Importantly, far-future projections suggest more potential shifts than near-future shifts in precipitation inequality. The simple daily intensity index (SDII) shows positive correlations with sociodemographic variables such as population, male, and female (r= 0.56, p< 0.01), suggesting a socioeconomic loss in the northern region. The results of the random forest model revealed that literacy rate and labor participation are critical sociodemographic factors influencing extreme precipitation in Bangladesh. Higher geopotential heights, lessened relative humidity, and increased monsoon rainfall, all connected to a decrease in surface pressure, contribute to the precipitation system’s inequality, as demonstrated by the. ERA5 reanalysis datasets. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the spatiotemporal irregularity of precipitation extremes and may assist policymakers in managing water-related disasters.",

      "abstract": "Environmental observation networks, such as AmeriFlux, are foundational for monitoring ecosystem response to climate change, management practices, and natural disturbances; however, their effectiveness depends on their representativeness for the regions or continents. We proposed an empirical, time series approach to quantify the similarity of ecosystem fluxes across AmeriFlux sites. We extracted the diel and seasonal characteristics (i.e., amplitudes, phases) from carbon dioxide, water vapor, energy, and momentum fluxes, which reflect the effects of climate, plant phenology, and ecophysiology on the observations, and explored the potential aggregations of AmeriFlux sites through hierarchical clustering. While net radiation and temperature showed latitudinal clustering as expected, flux variables revealed a more uneven clustering with many small (number of sites  100) to intermediate (15-70) groups, highlighting the significant ecological regulations of ecosystem fluxes. Many identified unique groups were from under-sampled ecoregions and biome types of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), with distinct flux dynamics compared to the rest of the network. At the finer spatial scale, local topography, disturbance, management, edaphic, and hydrological regimes further enlarge the difference in flux dynamics within the groups. Nonetheless, our clustering approach is a data-driven method to interpret the AmeriFlux network, informing future cross-site syntheses, upscaling, and model-data benchmarking research. Finally, we highlighted the unique and underrepresented sites in the AmeriFlux network, which were found mainly in Hawaii and Latin America, mountains, and at under-sampled IGBP types (e.g., urban, open water), motivating the incorporation of new/unregistered sites from these groups.",

Recently, the unprecedented Pantanal 2020 fire season (P20F), burning a third of the biome, resulted in well-reported local impacts on the ecosystem, economy, and health. Nevertheless, the long-range ripple effects of this event remain unknown. We investigated the P20F-related cascading hazards, integrating models, observational and satellite-based data. P20F-related smoke elevated PM 2.5 levels in the SA’s most populated area, exceeding WHO guidelines by up to 600%. Smoke-induced air pollution episodes coincided with widespread heatwaves, amplifying health risks. The mortality burden attributable to this multi-hazard short-term (14 days) exposure was estimated to be 2150 premature deaths (21% increase above expected levels). Our findings highlight that the impacts of CDHW-fires in SA are beyond the local level, implying growing challenges for risk management and public health and the need for governance based on telecoupled flows, linking different systems over multiple scales.",

Using hindcasts from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) multi-model seasonal forecast ensemble, the analysis explores the predictability of land-atmosphere interactions related to soil moisture anomalies. The results indicate that regions with strong soil-moisture-atmosphere coupling, such as parts of western North America, southern Europe, and Central Asia, exhibit potential for predicting seasonal temperature and precipitation patterns a season or more in advance. However, significant uncertainty exists in estimates of the soil-moisture initial conditions and soil-moisture persistence timescales. Moreover, while some regions exhibit realistic coupled behaviour, others, including a large swathe of North America, Eastern Europe, and Northern India display exaggerated coupling, resulting in systematic errors in temperature forecasts. This study underscores the potential for predicting the atmosphere in summer based on memory of soil-moisture initial conditions whilst highlighting the need to improve the representation of soil-moisture atmosphere feedbacks in order to enhance the skill of seasonal climate predictions over land.",

      "abstract": "The January 2025 wildfires in Los Angeles County, one of the most catastrophic fire seasons in recent decades, were driven by a confluence of extreme drought, high temperatures, and intense Santa Ana winds. While wildfires are a familiar threat in California, the unprecedented intensity, frequency, and scale of these blazes pushed residents and officials to confront challenges unlike anything the state had previously faced. This study examines the environmental conditions preceding the fires, focusing on multi-source satellite-derived and reanalysis datasets of soil moisture, temperature, precipitation anomalies, and wind patterns. The anomalous soil moisture depletion resulting from negative precipitation anomalies in southern California, combined with temperature anomalies exceeding +2.8 °C, created highly flammable conditions, while gusty winds exacerbated fire spread. Using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 for Land (ERA5-Land) datasets, we performed spatial and temporal anomaly analyses to quantify deviations from climatological norms. Spatial analysis revealed a strong correlation between moisture deficits and fire intensity, particularly in the wildland-urban interface zones. Additionally, the research highlights how a decrease in leaf area index (LAI) and prolonged aridity have increased vegetation vulnerability, contributing to the rapid escalation of fires. The findings underscore the urgent need for integrated climate adaptation strategies and resilient land-use planning to mitigate wildfire risks in wildland-urban zones.",

However, its effect on precipitation regimes, particularly at the sub-daily scale, is poorly understood. In this work, we use a high-resolution, spatially continuous satellite precipitation dataset to examine urbanization-induced shifts across precipitation intensities over global cities. We show that urbanization generally causes asymmetric shifts, increasing lower-intensity events and decreasing higher-intensity ones, with distinct patterns in tropical monsoon regions. These shifts, primarily driven by changes in event frequency, lead to reduced precipitation variability in urban areas, particularly in temperate cities and those exhibiting higher urbanization levels. Sub-daily analysis reveals that lower-intensity precipitation most notably increases in the early morning, while higher-intensity events decrease in the late afternoon, dampening diurnal precipitation variability. These findings offer important observational evidence of how urbanization alters precipitation regimes and highlight the need for adaptive urban water management strategies.",

      "abstract": "Droughts around the world have resulted in less annual streamflow relative to annual rainfall. The decrease in streamflow cannot be explained by changes in land-use, precipitation or temperature alone. Rather, the decrease in annual streamflow has been linked to changes in annual rainfall-partitioning. Climate change is predicted to induce similar, if not worse conditions than previous droughts. This could make the disproportionate shifts in annual streamflow more frequent or intense. Currently, most methods assume annual rainfall-partitioning remains constant and thus are unlikely to accurately predict how climate change could impact streamflow. Our aim is to conduct a thought-experiment to examine the various ways climate change could alter annual rainfall-partitioning and to determine what types of changes in rainfall-partitioning are likely to be statistically detectable in the coming decades. Using a synthetic streamflow model, we show how changing the rainfall-runoff intercept, rainfall-runoff slope, lag-1 autocorrelation, standard deviation per rainfall depth and, skewness per rainfall depth alters rainfall-partitioning. Of all the rainfall-partitioning changes examined only the rainfall-runoff intercept and slope are likely to be statistically detectable in the coming decades. Changes impacting lag-1 autocorrelation of annual streamflow, standard deviation per rainfall depth and skewness per rainfall depth are unlikely to be statistically detectable in the coming decades. Although being unlikely to be statistically identified, these changes still alter both the rainfall-runoff and streamflow-time relationships. Rainfall-partitioning changes that alter streamflow and are unlikely to be statistically detected in the coming decades will make prediction and allocation of water resources more challenging.",

      "abstract": "Effective water management requires a deeper understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of thresholds that trigger the propagation from meteorological to hydrological droughts. In this sense, this study resorts to a probabilistic approach for assessing the likelihood of occurrence of a hydrological drought at distinct levels (moderate, severe, and extreme) conditioned to the durations and severities of meteorological droughts. The aim is to investigate how climate conditions and catchment characteristics influence these propagation thresholds. Therefore, critical thresholds were estimated for 50 sub-basins in the Alto São Francisco River Basin, Brazil. The duration thresholds, whose medians were 3.61, 5.58, and 10.67 months for moderate, severe, and extreme events, respectively, were not too different across the study region, for all levels, and no clear spatial patterns could be found for this statistic. The severity thresholds, on the other hand, were more structured in space, with medians 4,13, 6.81, and 10.09 for the referred levels, but much more dispersed. Additionally, we analyzed the correlations among the propagation thresholds and mean annual precipitation, baseflow index, and land use characteristics of the sub-basins, but no significant relationships were identified. Our results highlighted the difficulties in describing the spatial variability of the propagation thresholds, due to the complex interactions of climate, storage, and human intervention. Despite these limitations, the proposed approach proved able to capture the joint variations of drought statistics and might be useful for water resources management, promoting better decision-making and the development of appropriate mitigation strategies.",

      "abstract": "Effect of catchment characteristics (e.g., land use/land cover changes) is increasingly accepted as the main cause of runoff changes, besides direct effects of climate change and human activities. However, previous studies usually attributed this effect to human activities, and ignored the effect of climate changes, namely chain transmission effects via catchment characteristic alterations. This study proposes a novel assessment approach of runoff change to disentangle both direct and chain transmission effects by adopting nonlinear relationships between catchment characteristic parameters and multiple impact factors into the Budyko framework. Eight catchments in the arid and semi-arid, semi-humid, and humid climatic zones are selected as our study area. Results show that runoff in most catchments decreases, while catchment characteristic parameters increase, with slopes of −2.44 to 3.79 mm/year and −0.003 to 0.017/year, respectively. It indicates that more precipitation evaporates than that contributing to runoff due to the catchment characteristic alterations. These changes are the most significant in the semi-humid zone, followed by those in the arid and semi-arid zone. Annual temperature and precipitation, gross domestic product, industrial water use, and population are the main impact factors. The contributions of human activities to runoff changes are usually the largest (i.e., −62.9% to 72.0%), followed by the direct effects of climate change (i.e., −32.6% to 88.0%). The chain transmission effects of climate change are also nonnegligible, with the contributions of −38.3% to 8.2%, particularly in the semi-humid zone. Our study improves the traditional Budyko-based framework for attributing runoff changes and provides scientific support for understanding hydrological cycle change mechanisms in climate-sensitive areas.",

      "abstract": "Severe drought increasingly threatens the resilience, productivity, and distribution of forest biomes worldwide. Understanding the evolution of tree drought resilience over the past century, along with its geographical and taxonomic relationships, is essential for predicting future forest dynamics. Using a tree-ring database from Canadian forests, encompassing 40,147 trees across 4558 plots and 23 species, we analyzed temporal and spatial patterns of drought resilience. We examined how leaf habit, prior drought exposure, and site- and tree-level factors influence growth resistance (immediate drought response), growth recovery (post-drought growth resumption), and overall resilience. Our findings indicate that most major Canadian tree species exhibit low and declining drought resilience. Mean temperature, moisture availability, and elevation emerged as critical factors in shaping tree responses to drought. At high elevation, drought impacts were buffered by cool temperatures, enabling trees to maintain stable growth rates. Deciduous species showed a significant decline in recovery and resilience throughout the 20th century, whereas evergreen species displayed stable but low resilience and recovery. Summer droughts particularly reduced resistance and recovery in deciduous species compared to evergreens. However, prior drought exposure mitigated negative drought responses over a tree's lifetime, suggesting an adaptive capacity in both evergreen and deciduous species. Older forests unaccustomed to severe droughts appear especially vulnerable, potentially leading to shifts in ecosystem composition and reduced biodiversity. The declining resilience of deciduous species, combined with the low resilience of evergreens, suggests major changes for Canadian forests, including reduced productivity and altered species composition. Our results emphasize the importance of proactive forest management strategies to preserve forest productivity and biodiversity in the context of a changing climate.",

However, their accuracy varies across RSET estimation methods and diverse hydroclimate regions. While ET modeling efforts to account for biophysical processes and controlling parameters have made good progress in recent years, a parallel approach of integrating in-situ ET with RSET could reduce biases in RSET products. Basin water balance ET (WBET) and flux tower ET are widely applied to evaluate RSET accuracy, yet such ET measurements are rarely used for RSET bias corrections, especially for large area applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: the water balance equivalence (WABE) method, which generates spatially continuous WBET for correcting biases in RSET products. The WABE method computes synthetic WBET by integrating observed WBET and flux tower-derived FLUXCOM ET, which fills the spatial gaps of observed WBET and generates a spatially continuous WBET dataset. Synthetic WBET (2002-2015 annual average) of eight-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC8) basins across the conterminous United States (CONUS), constituting 44 % (887 out of 2035 basins) of CONUS basins, was determined within 2.0 % (RMSE = 12 %) of observed WBET at CONUS and between 1-12 % (RMSE = 3-33 %) across 18 regions in CONUS. With WABE-based bias corrections, the overall annual bias of RSET decreased from 10 % (RMSE = 34 %) to 6 % (RMSE = 26 %) across 37 flux tower sites. The WABE method offers a new approach for RSET accuracy improvement and shows great promise for large area implementations with a potential to yield substantial benefits for building accurate basin water budgets and water management decisions",

Though the low precipitation and high temperature leading to reduced soil moisture have been well documented, the quantitative estimation of the impact of CDHEs on soil moisture deficits (or agricultural droughts) has been rather limited. In this study, we investigated the distinct response of soil moisture deficits to CDHEs across two major basins in China, the Yangtze River Basin (YZRB) (mostly humid regions) and the Yellow River Basin (YRB) (mostly arid and semi-arid regions). We found the response of soil moisture deficits is stronger under CDHEs compared with individual meteorological droughts (precipitation deficits). In addition, due to the difference in evapotranspiration response, the physical processes of soil moisture deficits responding to CDHEs in the YZRB differ from those in the YRB. The differences in meteorological factors (e.g., rainfall, temperature, vapour pressure deficit, radiation and evapotranspiration) leading to soil moisture deficits under individual meteorological droughts and CDHEs are also investigated. The case study of the record CDHEs during 2022 further demonstrates the response pattern of soil moisture deficits and associated driving factors. These results highlight the importance of considering different climate regions in understanding the impact of CDHEs on agricultural droughts.",

      "abstract": "Compound agricultural drought and hot events (CADHEs, co-occurring soil moisture depletion and high temperature) have intensified over the last decades and are expected to further rise in view of climate change. Such increasing climate hazards have the potential to push agricultural systems towards critical tipping points with dramatic consequences for human societies. Despite the urgency of this issue, the future evolution of CADHEs characteristics in response to changing environmental conditions remains poorly quantified. Here, we propose a multivariate probabilistic assessment framework based on a copula function to integrate the key characteristics of CADHEs - duration, intensity, and severity - and project future CADHEs dynamics. To this aim, CADHEs are identified based on the joint distribution of standardized soil moisture index (SSI) and standardized temperature index (STI) retrieved for the mid-term (2021-2060) and long-term (2061-2100) periods from an ensemble of nine Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) Global Climate Models under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (sustainability pathway and high-emissions pathway: SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5). Results show that the likelihood of CADHEs is projected to increase globally throughout the 21st century compared to the baseline period (1975-2014), with a more pronounced increase under SSP5-8.5. Northern Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia emerge as key hotspots where longer duration, greater intensity, and higher severity are expected to manifest simultaneously. Under SSP5-8.5, these hotpots are expected to expand further compared to SSP1-2.6, particularly in the long-term period. Our findings provide useful input for forthcoming global disaster risk and adaptation policy, ultimately contributing to the long-term stability of agricultural systems and food security.",

      "abstract": "Across North America, warmer temperatures have increased reference evapotranspiration (ETo), taxing water resources. This problem is especially pronounced for semi-arid regions with large amounts of irrigated agriculture, such as California's Central Valley. In this region, increased ETo has increased irrigation demand, but the role of anthropogenic climate change (ACC) in driving this increase has not yet been quantified. Here, we quantified the influence of ACC on ETo and how these changes have translated into increased irrigation demand. We calculated observational ETo from ERA5-Land and counterfactual ETo that removes the forced changes simulated by 20 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 from the observational records. At the scale of North America, we found that ACC drove a 64 mm increase in annual ETo from 1980 to 2022, compared to the observed 54 mm increase. The largest observed increases in ETo were found in the southwestern and central regions, where ACC has likely exacerbated trends linked to natural climate variability. The largest ACC contributor to increased ETo was increased vapor pressure deficit, while decreased solar radiation has tempered increased ETo. Finally, we found that ACC has increased annual crop irrigation demand in the Central Valley by 0.76 km 3 during 1980-2022, with cumulative increased irrigation demand of 9.2 km 3 , equivalent to ∼11% of the region's groundwater loss during this time. Our findings suggest that ACC is accelerating demand for water in this already water-limited region, and this phenomenon is likely occurring in other semi-arid agricultural regions of North America.",

      "abstract": "The escalating demand for agricultural land, along with limited availability in lowland areas, has driven cropland expansion into highlands (CEIH), potentially resulting in land degradation, habitat degradation, and a decline in food production. However, few studies thoroughly investigated the distribution and driving factors of global CEIH, even though a considerable amount of cropland has extended to the highlands over recent decades. To investigate CEIH, we employed spatial statistics, elevation spectrum analysis, and terrain gradient methods to quantify spatio-temporal patterns and elevation changes in global cropland distribution from 1995 to 2020. We then explored the key driving factors of CEIH at different scales using spatial regression models and multiscale geo-weighted regression model. The results revealed that global average cropland elevation increased from 422.782 m in 1995 to 427.321 m in 2020, representing a 4.539 m net increase. CEIH was reflected on both global and continental scales in all continents except South America during the study period. Furthermore, CEIH showed an intense agglomeration pattern. Human activities and cropland reclamation rate emerged as the primary underlying driving factors of CEIH. The encroachment of development on lowland agricultural areas forced CEIH, which was the core of this phenomenon. Vertical cropland expansion was predominantly concentrated in ecologically vulnerable highlands and ecological transition zones. The driving factors of CEIH exhibited spatial and multiscale heterogeneity. These findings provided a scientific basis for formulating targeted cropland conservation policies by highlighting the differences in cropland management performance across various levels of government globally.",

Focusing on South China, this study identified heat wave-extreme precipitation compound events based on summer daily maximum temperature and precipitation data of 79 meteorological stations spanning 1970 to 2019. A two-dimensional joint cumulative probability distribution function of heat wave intensity and extreme precipitation intensity was constructed using the copula function, and the return periods of different types of compound events were analyzed to evaluate their occurrence characteristics. The results indicate that the average heatwave intensity and extreme precipitation intensity increased at rates of 0.1°C per decade and 4.1 mm per decade, respectively. A two-dimensional joint analysis of heatwave and extreme precipitation intensities was performed, with the Gaussian copula function identified as the most appropriate model. In recent years compound events have exhibited higher frequencies, stronger intensities, wider spatial distributions, and significantly shorter return periods compared to earlier periods. Moreover, under similar conditions of heatwave and extreme precipitation, the Pearl River Delta and northern mountainous regions are more prone to the occurrence of compound events.",

      "abstract": "China has implemented large-scale hydraulic engineering projects in arid regions where water resources are severely scarce to efficiently maximize limited water resources for production and domestic needs. The processes and consequences of how the change of hydrological factors affects vegetation distribution remain unclear. This study employed multi-source remote sensing data to investigate the impact of hydrological factors on vegetation distribution in the Shiyang River Basin (SRB) in the arid region in Northwestern China. The results indicate that: (1) The NDVI values in the SRB showed a fluctuating upward trend of (0.0014/yr), with vegetation increase occurring in 62.71% of the area while vegetation degradation was observed in only 6.44% of the area. (2) The Surface Water Storage Anomaly (SWSA) shows an increasing trend of (0.112 mm/month), while Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA) and Groundwater Storage Anomaly (GWSA) exhibit significant declines at rates of -0.124 mm/month and -0.236 mm/month, respectively. (3) Vegetation growth on agricultural land and in planted forests has shown significant growth, in contrast to the general degradation of natural vegetation that is dependent on groundwater. In addition, surface water inputs directly catalyze vegetation growth dynamics. However, the complex mechanisms linking vegetation increase and decreasing terrestrial water reserves in arid regions still need to be studied in depth. The potential negative ecological impacts that may result from the continuous decline of terrestrial and groundwater reserves should not be taken lightly.",

      "abstract": "In 2023, South America experienced an unprecedented heatwave that threatened socioeconomic structures and ecosystems. This study uses attribution analysis to evaluate the contributions of atmospheric circulation patterns and human factors to the heatwave's probability and intensity. The 2023 heatwave is a 1-in-130-year event and a 1-in-65-year event, with and without considering the 2023 heatwave in the fitting, respectively. The large-scale meteorological analysis revealed that the heatwave was driven by an anomalously high-pressure system that formed a heat dome from dry, hot air columns. ALL (all-forcing scenario) and GHG (greenhouse gas scenario) simulations indicate the likelihood of future extreme heatwaves increases by 28.45% [27.60%, 29.30%] (90% confidence interval) and 30.42% [29.51%, 31.33%] (90% confidence interval), respectively, based on data from 1850 to 2014.

The research aims to determine the weather conditions that favor the occurrence of wildfires and their spatial impact on vegetation and to assess the degree of land degradation after the wildfires. Through the calculation of the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), critical dry periods with significantly negative values were identified in July (− 1.60) and August (− 1.94), indicating severe droughts with a high hazard of wildfire occurrence. Additionally, the calculation of the Angstrom index identified a period of high wildfire hazard (from July 5 to August 5, 2017). Vegetation condition monitoring and burn severity during the high-hazard period were assessed by calculating the differenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dNDVI) and the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). By intersecting dNDVI and dNBR with the results of the supervised classification, the impact of wildfires on different land use types was effectively assessed. It was determined that a total of 214.61 km 2 (dNDVI) and 168.77 km 2 (dNBR) of meadows and pastures, 270.45 km 2 (dNDVI) and 35.2 km 2 (dNBR) of forested areas, and 30.12 km 2 (dNDVI) and 17.95 km 2 (dNBR) agriculture areas where exposed to moderate, high, and very high wildfires. Additionally, a total of 19,077 residents were affected by the wildfires. The research results highlight the need to develop and implement more effective prevention and hazard management strategies, particularly in protecting the study area’s forest ecosystems and agriculture.",

      "abstract": "Global warming is increasing the frequency and intensity of drought events, posing profound threats to ecosystems. Ecological drought is a multifaceted process in terrestrial ecosystems, characterized by the impairment of vegetation eco-physiological functions due to water stress. However, current ecological drought assessments primarily focus on ecological water supply and demand, often overlooking the status of vegetation growth. To address this gap, we developed a standardized composite ecological drought index (SCEDI) that integrates precipitation (Pre), ecological water deficit (EWD), and the vegetation health index (VHI) using a Euclidean distance-based approach. We further analyzed spatiotemporal dynamics of ecological drought and its characteristics, utilizing run theory and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) methods. Results showed that ecological drought intensified in spring (SCEDI change: −0.002) and winter (−0.013), but weakened in summer (0.006) and autumn (0.002). The first EOF mode explained 30.51 % of the total variance, indicating a reversal in wet-dry patterns between mountainous regions and oases around 2002. Over the past 34 years, Xinjiang has experienced more than 19 ecological drought events, each with an average duration of approximately 3.11 months. Regionally, droughts in mountainous areas occurred more frequently but were shorter and less intense, while in oasis areas they were less frequent but more persistent and severe. Furthermore, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis identified EWD (SHAP value: 0.265) and precipitation (0.176) as the most influential drivers of ecological drought. Higher values of both factors were positively associated with ecological drought severity, while lower values had a mitigating effect. This study highlights the potential of SCEDI in accurately capturing ecological drought dynamics and provides a scientific basis for ecological risk assessment and adaptive drought management in arid regions.",

      "abstract": "Escalating impacts of snow droughts have critically threatened hydrological stability and socioeconomic resilience on the Tibetan Plateau, Asia’s alpine water tower. However, the mechanisms linking snow droughts to compound climate extremes remain poorly understood. Here, we presented comprehensive assessment of how snow drought regimes modulated compound climate extremes during the period 1979-2022. We found significant increases in severity for both dry snow droughts and warm snow droughts, with warm types emerging as a dominant driver of snowpack depletion. Dry/warm snow droughts triggered compound dry-hot/pluvial-hot extremes through divergent heat-moisture regulation pathways: surface energy budget imbalances acted as the common trigger, while moisture heterogeneity governed the dry-wet divergence. After snow disappearance, a significant coincidence rate of 0.68 (0.58) for compound dry-hot extremes (compound pluvial-hot extremes) was observed at a 1-month lag time ( p < 0.05). These findings necessitate adaptive strategies to mitigate cascading threats to water-ecosystem-socioeconomic systems in the Asian water tower.",

Even treatments with lower overall efficacy successfully modified firebehavior when applied at large scales. Fuel treatment effectiveness outcomes were robust underextreme weather conditions.

Using fully coupled Earth system modeling and flux tower observations, we disentangle radiative (surface available energy) and non-radiative (advection-sustained vapor gradients) controls on global ET. The decoupling factor, a pivotal biophysical regulator of land-atmosphere coupling for ET, exhibits a climate-vegetation latitudinal gradient spanning 0.1 (arid) to 0.5 (continental). Global warming enhances land-atmosphere coupling, suppressing radiative contributions while amplifying non-radiative influences. Urbanization reduces ET but tends to shift its dominant driver toward available energy, unlike rural areas dominated by advection-sustained vapor gradients. The urban-rural contrast in the radiative contributor intensifies at ∼0.3 W m −2 decade −1 (2.4 times that of the non-radiative contributor) under RCP8.5, linked to a 60% slower decline in urban decoupling factor than rural areas. This study provides a fuller picture of the mechanistic understanding of ET.",

The leading management practice to promote conifer resilience is to reduce fuel loads and tree density. However, it is unknown if these policies will enable forests to persist in the long term. Here we further develop, calibrate, and benchmark the FATES vegetation model to project changes in vegetation structure, including conifer and oak basal area and shrub cover, under a high global warming future climate scenario (2015-2098) and management scenarios in a mixed conifer forest in California’s southern Sierra Nevada. Accounting for vegetation parameter uncertainty, we found that tree thinning and surface fuel reduction treatments delayed conifer losses until∼ 2070, but could not prevent a shift towards oak-dominant forests by 2100 when drought coincided with regional mean annual temperatures exceeding 3.5 C above pre-industrial levels (equivalent to 2.5 C of global mean warming). Our results suggest that dry mixed conifer forests in California will be a carbon source under 2.5 C of global mean warming in the late 21st century regardless of management and that conifer fire resilience efforts are being deployed in areas that would ultimately transition to oak-dominant forests if global warming exceeds 2.5 C. However, there is still significant projection uncertainty associated with key biological traits controlling photosynthesis, fuel drying and decomposition rates, drought tolerance, and competition between conifers, oaks, and shrubs. We recommend targeted data collection for these traits to reduce projection uncertainty.",

However, as a key indicator vital in regulating agricultural productivity and crop irrigation, water use efficiency (WUE c ) is becoming increasingly complex to estimate due to climate change. This study explores the critical role of key meteorological drivers, such as maximum temperature (tmax) and vapor pressure deficit (vpd), and their impacts on crop-specific WUE c . Future impacts are also assessed through integrating machine learning models with climate projections from the CMIP6 framework under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios to forecast WUE c trends from 2025 to 2099. Based on WUEc projections, crop-switching strategies were designed to optimize land allocation among cereals in the Imperial Valley and Lower Gila River regions. Results suggest that reallocating cereal crops under SSP2-4.5 can reduce water consumption by up to 13.7 %, while increasing farmers’ profits (up to 44.8 %) and calorie production (up to 2.7 %). Under the warmer SSP5-8.5 scenario, sustaining profit (up to 39 %) and calorie gains (up to 10.2 %) would require up to 9.5 % more water. These findings highlight the importance of crop-switching as a practical adaptation strategy and emphasize the need for region-specific approaches to ensure resilience to climate change. The research underscores the potential of climate-driven decision-making to enhance agricultural sustainability in water-scarce environments.",

Here, we examined the trajectories, interdependencies and drivers of multidimensional WUE metrics and their components (gross primary production (GPP), evapotranspiration, transpiration (T), and canopy conductance (Gc)) using a conceptual drought propagation framework. We found that even though the carbon assimilation efficiency per stomata increases during drought, the canopy-level WUE (represented by transpiration WUE (TWUE)) declines, indicating that stomatal regulation operates primarily at the leaf level and cannot offset the drought-induced reduction in WUE at the canopy scale. A stronger dependence on T and TWUE indicates that the water-carbon trade-off relationship of vegetation more inclines toward water transport than carbon assimilation. Gc fails to prevent the sharp decline in GPP during drought and has limited capacity to suppress T, as reflected by the reduction magnitude and the threshold (the turning point at which a component shifts from a normal to drought-responsive state). The primary drivers of the water-carbon relationship under drought propagation include vapor pressure deficit and hydraulic traits. Among plant functional types, grasslands show the strongest water-carbon fluxes in response to drought, whereas evergreen broadleaf forests exhibit the weakest response. These findings refine our comprehensive understanding of multidimensional ecosystem functional dynamics under drought propagation and enlighten how the physiological response of vegetation to drought affects the carbon and water cycles.",

This study employed environmental covariates representing climate, soil, and vegetation, combined with a hybrid convolutional neural network - Long Short-term Memory-self-attention (CNN-LSTM-SA) model to predict net primary productivity (NPP) of the Northeast China (NEC) and the Mississippi River Basin (MRB) Mollisol regions. The analysis covered the periods from 2001 to 2020, and 2021 to 2040 under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs): SSP245 and SSP585. Subsequently, areas requiring crop type adjustments were identified, and appropriate crops were assigned to each growth site. Our results elucidate that: (a) During 2021-2040, a general increase in temperature and minor fluctuations in precipitation were observed across the study area. In the NEC, crop NPP initially increases before decreasing, whereas in the MRB, it consistently decreases. (b) Both vegetation and soil covariates explained 75.6% of NPP variability in the NEC, while in the MRB, climate factors, particularly precipitation, accounted for 18.4% of the variability. (c) The proportion of area requiring adjustment in the NEC ranged from 4.45% to 5.13% (SSP245) to 5.05%-5.77% (SSP585), while in the MRB, it varied from 4.92% to 7.54% (SSP245) to 6.49%-9.10% (SSP585), suggesting a necessity for more substantial cropping type adjustments under the SSP585 climate scenario. (d) In the NEC, the area cultivated with corn, soybean, and other crops will decrease, while rice cultivation will increase. Conversely, a decrease in wheat and pasture, and an increase in corn and soybean cultivation are suggested in the MRB. (e) Following crop type adjustments, the average NPP enhancements for corn, soybean, rice, and other crops in unsuitable areas of the NEC were 22.85%, 22.2%, 17.35%, and 20.5%, respectively, In the MRB, the average NPP enhancements for corn, soybean, wheat, and pasture were 28.5%, 26.9%, 32.4%, and 21.1%, respectively. Our research provides valuable insights into predicting future NPP changes, and develops effective crop adjustment strategies to address global food security challenges.",

      "abstract": "Accurately quantifying evapotranspiration ( ET ) and gross primary production ( GPP ) is essential for sustainable agroecosystem management. Hybrid deep learning ( DL ) models, which integrate physical knowledge with data-driven techniques, have demonstrated strong potential in improving flux predictions. However, most existing frameworks estimated ET and GPP separately, thereby overlooking their intrinsic coupling via shared physiological mechanisms such as stomatal regulation. In this perspective, we proposed a novel hybrid modeling framework that incorporated DL -based canopy stomatal conductance ( G s ) as an intermediary biophysical variable within process-based host models to simultaneously estimate ET and GPP . The framework was evaluated using multi-year eddy covariance observations from sunflower and maize agroecosystems under three constraint strategies: water-only ( HDW ), carbon-only ( HDC ), and joint water-carbon ( HDWC ). Results showed that although HDW and HDC achieved high target-specific accuracies, they exhibited limited generalization in cross-target predictions. In contrast, the HDWC model, optimized with weighting coefficients of 0.5 for sunflower and 0.6 for maize, effectively balanced the trade-off between ET and GPP , achieving average Kling-Gupta Efficiency ( KGE ) values of 0.881 for sunflower and 0.931 for maize. Multi-year evaluations further revealed that HDWC reduced root mean square errors ( RMSE ) to 0.45 and 0.50 mm d −1 for ET , and 0.97 and 1.35 g C m −2 d −1 for GPP in sunflower and maize, respectively, while minimizing interannual variability and extreme biases. Notably, the inter-model differences in G s estimates highlighted the enhanced interpretability of HDWC , which more realistically captured the physiological coupling between water and carbon fluxes. Overall, our findings demonstrated that the joint constraint strategy provided a robust and interpretable framework for the simultaneous prediction of ET and GPP , offering a valuable tool for advancing intelligent simulations of agroecosystem processes.",

      "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) accounts for the majority of water available from precipitation in the terrestrial water cycle, and improvements to the accuracy, resolution, and coverage of ET data can enhance hydrologic models and assessments. The OpenET collaboration of six remotely sensed ET modeling teams has demonstrated that an ensemble approach to ET estimation generally provides improved accuracy relative to individual ensemble members. The performance of individual models has been shown to vary by land cover type and climate zone, but a thorough study of the variables that influence model performance differences has not yet been conducted. In this paper, we model the performance of OpenET models relative to flux tower data as a function of variables such as land cover type and precipitation. These performance models are used to map estimated OpenET model performance across the conterminous United States. We develop relative weights based on these modeled performance metrics and show that a performance-weighted ensemble improves accuracy relative to the current OpenET ensemble method to varying degrees. The monthly mean absolute error of the weighted ensemble is reduced relative to the current method by 8% in agricultural settings, by 23% in shrublands and mixed forests, and by 5% in grasslands and evergreen forests. We produce weight maps that can be used to generate performance-weighted ensemble values for OpenET data. The results can be used to inform model selection and provide insight about the controls on model performance that could lead to model refinement.",

Here, we investigate the influence of preceding winter snow on spring wildfires in Northeastern Asia. Our results reveal soil moisture serves as a key mediator linking winter snow to spring fires. Anomalously low (high) snowfall during winter leads to drier (wetter) land surfaces in spring, thereby increasing (decreasing) spring wildfire risk. A multiple linear regression model based on this mechanistic association achieves a robust four-month lead forecast of spring burned area, with a prediction-observation Spearman correlation of 0.65 ( p < 0.01), and explains 41% of the variability in the spring burned area across Northeast Asia. Cross-validation further confirms the significance and reliability of this lead-time relationship. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of winter snow in modulating spring wildfire activity in Northeastern Asia and demonstrate the potential to leverage snow conditions to improve seasonal wildfire forecasts.",

This innovative tool streamlines the workflow from raw climate data processing to projections of annual shocks to crop yields at the country level, using the response surfaces from an empirical econometric model developed and documented in Waldhoff et al. (2020), which leverages historical weather, CO2, and crop yield data for robust empirical fitting for 17 crops. gaia uses these response surfaces with monthly temperature and precipitation projections (e.g., from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) (O’Neill et al., 2016) climate data bias-adjusted and statistically downscaled by the ISIMIP3BASD approach (Lange, 2019) in the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) (Warszawski et al., 2014)) to project yield shocks that can be applied to agricultural productivity changes at the country level for use in multisectoral economic models. The historical and future projections use gridded, country-and-crop specific monthly growing season precipitation and temperature data, aggregated to the national level, and weighted by cropland area derived from the global Monthly Irrigated and Rainfed Crop Areas around the year 2000 (MIRCA2000) dataset (Portmann et al., 2010). These annual, country, and crop-specific yield shocks can be aggregated to different definitions of regions, crop commodities, and time periods, as needed by specific multisectoral economic models. gaia serves as a lightweight, powerful tool that can aid exploration of crop yield responses under a broad range of future climate projections, enhancing human-Earth system analysis capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Increasing climate variability, especially prolonged droughts, shapes forest water consumption and constrains vegetation growth. However, the effects of drought-induced changes on evapotranspiration (ET) fluxes vary due to species-specific differences and drought characteristics. Here, we analyzed the seasonal variations in ET in pine, beech, and mixed forest stands in northeast Germany (2012-2021) and explored the ability of a process-based ecohydrological model (EcH 2 O) in reproducing the water balance components observed at three forested lysimeters. To better understand how individual climate variables control ET fluxes, we performed simulation experiments with detrended climate inputs. Multi-variable calibration showed that the model reproduced well in-situ soil moisture, seepage, and interception (EI) in the three stands. Precipitation (P) was the main driver of ET anomalies, with above-average ET in wet years and below-average ET in dry years. However, only small reductions in ET were observed during the dry year 2018. This could be attributed to high P in the previous year, i.e., P legacy effects, which led to only small reductions or even positive anomalies in ET. The beech stand, with a seasonal leaf cycle, had lower ET and interception losses compared to the pine and mixed stands, which maintain year-round foliage. This resulted in greater percolation to deeper soil layers in beech forests. These findings suggest that broadleaf species such as beech by allowing greater water transfer to groundwater, offer a distinct hydrological advantage in terms of promoting deep percolation. Our results therefore provide a process-based rationale for the strategic selection of broadleaf species in forest management to enhance groundwater recharge and promote sustainable water management. Additionally, model testing at such data-rich sites will be valuable for improving the process-consistency and reliability of other hydrological models, particularly in studies aimed at investigating the effects of different vegetation cover.",

Here, we utilize the lag-1 temporal autocorrelation of satellite-based vegetation data to evaluate long-term resilience trends in stable and restored forests across China from 2001 to 2020, then apply machine-learning algorithms to explore the key drivers behind these trends. Results show that nearly half (45%) of forest ecosystems have experienced resilience declines, whether they are stable forests (44.4%) or restored forests (44.8%). Increased aridity and interannual precipitation variability have a significant impact on the resilience declines in both types of forest ecosystems. Comparatively, non-climate variables exert a larger impact on resilience declines in restored forests than in stable forests. Resilience declines are more prevalent in restored forests with low plant species richness (0.2 m 3 /m 3 ). Structural equation models reveal that fewer critical factors directly influence the resilience of restored forests compared to stable forests. These findings underscore the importance of integrating these determinants into ecological restoration efforts to ensure forestation sustainability.",

      "abstract": "The recent development of the physics-aware Mass-Conserving Long Short-Term Memory network (MC-LSTM) provides an alternative to other data-driven Deep Learning (DL) models in hydrology. Mass-Conserving Long Short-Term Memory incorporates mass conservation directly into the LSTM architecture. Despite the theoretical advancements, studies have reported a surprisingly limited performance of the MC-LSTM in streamflow simulation. We hypothesize that such a limitation is due to the unrealistic mass conservation scheme in MC-LSTM, which overlooks unobserved incoming water fluxes beyond precipitation. As an attempt to verify this hypothesis, we propose a Mass Conservation Relaxed LSTM (MCR-LSTM), which incorporates a bi-directional mass relaxation (MR) component to account for potential incoming water fluxes beyond precipitation. We train and test the proposed MCR-LSTM model across 531 watersheds in the contiguous United States (CONUS) against three baseline models: the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting, LSTM, and MC-LSTM. Our results show that MCR-LSTM outperforms MC-LSTM despite its underperformance compared to LSTM. Specifically, MCR-LSTM's advantage over MC-LSTM is mainly seen in the Plains and Western U.S., where the newly incorporated MR component better simulates water loss and suggests the likely existence of additional incoming water fluxes beyond precipitation, respectively. The novelty and contribution of this study are twofold: firstly, it introduces an alternative physics-aware DL tool (i.e., MCR-LSTM) in hydrology with higher accuracy in specific regions compared to MC-LSTM. Secondly, it provides a diagnosis of regions where strict, precipitation-based mass conservation constraints may be unrealistic in streamflow simulation.",

      "abstract": "Dryland ecosystems are a critical component of the terrestrial carbon cycle and host a significant portion of the world's biodiversity. Under anthropogenic warming, these water-limited ecosystems are increasingly threatened by the more frequent and severe heatwaves and often co-occurring droughts (known as compound hot-dry extremes). However, the respective impacts of heat and water stress on ecosystems functioning in drylands during compound extremes remain unexplored. Using satellite-observed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence as a proxy for vegetation productivity, our study examined its response to variations of soil moisture and air temperature by separating conditions where the two climatic factors are coupled (hot and dry) or decoupled (hot but not dry, dry but not hot). The decoupled conditions confirm soil moisture as the predominant control of dryland ecosystem productivity. However, temperature acts as a significant modulator of the moisture control particularly under wet or dry extremes: high temperatures amplify both the adverse effect of dry extremes and the positive effect of wet extremes. The productivity sensitivity to temperature and water varies strongly across regions and vegetation types, with deeper-rooted vegetation exhibiting stronger resistance to hot-dry extremes. With more frequent occurrence of hot-dry extremes under global warming, this trend leads to more negative productivity anomalies and leaves a footprint on the trajectory of productivity changes in drylands. This study highlights the additional heat-water stress on dryland ecosystems by compound hot-dry extremes superimposed on that from anthropogenic warming and drying, which adversely impact photosynthetic activities and increasingly counteract the beneficial CO 2 fertilization effect.",

Developing high-precision fire risk assessment models and identifying key driving factors are essential for effective fire prevention and control. However, selecting appropriate modeling variables and revealing the spatial heterogeneity of driving forces remain insufficient in current research. To address these issues, this study compared and analyzed multiple variable selection methods (PCA, LASSO, Stepwise Regression) coupled with machine learning algorithm (RF, SVM, BP-ANN) to identify the optimal modeling framework for simulating the spatial distribution of forest and grassland fire risk in Xinjiang from 2001 to 2022. Furthermore, we detected temporal breakpoints and trend conversions, and quantified the contribution of driving factors. The results indicate that: (1) Step_RF model is the optimal model (Acc = 89.31 %, F1 = 88.19 %, AUC = 0.9546) for simulating forest and grassland fire risk in Xinjiang; (2) Spatially, fire risk exhibited a decreasing gradient from northwest to southeast, with higher risk in regions of high altitude and high vegetation coverage; (3) Most of the region showed a significant increasing trend, nearly half of the region experienced a trend shift from increasing to decreasing in 2015-2019; (4) All variables exhibited bidirectional effects, with aboveground biomass showed a particularly pronounced positive influence in shrublands, open forest land, medium-coverage and low-coverage grasslands.

In this study, ecological modeling combined with hotspot analysis was applied to quantify the spatial mismatch between ecosystem service (ES) supply and demand on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in 2020. We introduced the concept of comparative ecological radiation force (CERF) to characterize the spatial flow of ESs and to estimate the total compensation required to balance these flows. Our results highlight that the value of carbon sequestration, represented by net primary production (NPP), reached 1.21 × 106 CNY, alongside other key services such as soil conservation (SC) (284.69 × 10 6 CNY), water yield (WY) (44.99 × 10 6 CNY) and food supply (FS) (20.81 × 10 6 CNY). The directional analysis of service flows revealed that NPP, along with SC and WY, predominantly flowed from east to west, while FS exhibited a north-to-south pattern. Notably, NPP received only 0.16% of the total ecological compensation, in contrast to 95.42% for SC, 4.21% for WY, and 0.21% for FS. This study provides an integrated framework for aligning EC strategies with carbon management goals, offering insights to support carbon neutrality efforts and ecosystem restoration on the TP.",

      "abstract": "The intrinsic water use efficiency ( W ) of trees serves as a key variable linking water and carbon fluxes in forest ecosystems. Interannual variations in aridity (e.g., represented by the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, SPEI) can cause changes in W . However, it is unclear whether the aridity constraint on W , as indicated by the sensitivity of W to SPEI (S W ), has changed with recent climate change. Here, we use stable carbon isotope abundance of tree rings from 296 sites to estimate interannual variation of W and S W . S W is defined as the slope in a linear regression of W against SPEI and is negative for most of the tree sites. Our findings suggest an increasing aridity constraint on W from 1951 to 2010, with the absolute value of S W increasing by 112% over the period. This more negative trend in S W is statistically significant for gymnosperms but not for angiosperms. The change in S W over the past six decades is linked to rising aridity and atmospheric CO 2 , as revealed by a theoretical stomatal model. Our study highlights the increasing aridity control on tree W variation and implies the resilience of tree intrinsic functions to aridity variability under future climate change.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, compound climate and weather extremes have received significant attention due to the heightened threat they pose to the environment, human societies, and the economy. This study investigates the impacts of compound drought-flood (CDF) extremes using data from two widely-used disaster databases: the emergency events database (EM-DAT) and its geocoded disasters (GDIS), along with the DesInventar database. The analysis covers the period from 1960 to 2018, consistent with GDIS’temporal coverage. CDF events are defined as instances where drought and flood hazards occur concurrently or sequentially, with a flood taking place during a drought period or within four months of its end. Our findings for the global extratropics reveal that the economic losses and the number of affected people resulting from CDF events are up to eight times higher than those ascribed to isolated droughts or floods, with a confidence interval ranging from one to twelve. Similar qualitative results emerge from DesInventar and EM-DAT, albeit with some quantitative differences. Furthermore, impact ratios have increased in more recent decades compared to earlier periods, emphasizing the increasing impacts of the drought-flood compound events. These results highlight the amplified negative impacts when droughts and floods occur concomitantly or sequentially, underscoring the need for targeted policies to address their socioeconomic risks, particularly under changing climatic conditions.",

      "abstract": "Various composite drought indices have been developed to quantify drought conditions. However, many challenges, such as inadequate soil moisture representation, empirical variable weights, and arbitrary drought classification, still exist. Xinjiang was selected as a typical study area, and an Improved Scaled Drought Condition Index (ISDCI) was developed by integrating precipitation, vegetation, temperature, and downscaled soil moisture with objectively determined weights. Additionally, the classification of drought severity has been refined in a relatively objective way. The results indicate the following: (1) Compared to the Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI) and the Vegetation Health Index (VHI), ISDCI showed a higher correlation with the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI). (2) The optimized drought classification scheme exhibited better alignment with SPEI in terms of drought frequency and drought affected area. (3) Based on ISDCI, Xinjiang experienced an overall drying trend during the 2001-2023 growing seasons. The Ili River Basin dried the fastest (slope = − 8 × 10 −4 ), while the Tarim River Basin showed the slowest drying trend (slope = −2 × 10 −4 ). Oases and some mountainous areas became wetter, whereas deserts continued to dry. (4) ISDCI effectively captured major droughts, including those in Xinjiang (2008) and the Ili River Basin (2014). Overall, ISDCI offers high-resolution and near-real-time drought monitoring capabilities, providing scientific support for agricultural management and water resource regulation in arid and semi-arid regions.",

In this paper, we examine future rice production failure risks across India by integrating down-scaled climate projections with machine learning models that capture complex crop-climate interactions. First, we identify key drivers of historical crop failures and demonstrate the critical role of monthly weather variability. We then use our historically-trained ML models to project future production failure risk across India, linking spatial changes in failure risk with projected future weather distributions and exploratory scenarios of changes in irrigation access. Our findings indicate that district-level risks of rice production failures in India are projected to increase (26% average) under future climate change across all shared socioeconomic pathways in the near (2025-2054) and far (2055-2084) future. Our analysis demonstrates that expanding irrigation access could play a vital role in mitigating these risks, with substantial risk reductions observed in high-vulnerability regions. These insights provide actionable information for policymakers aiming to enhance agricultural resilience, identifying priority areas where adaptive measures, particularly irrigation improvements, can most effectively reduce vulnerability to climate-driven production risks.",

Among all investigated economies, Russia has demonstrated the strongest co-relationship (R-squared value of 0.730) between unseasonal CO 2 emissions and land cover changes, indicative of its heavy reliance on fossil fuels. Both Brazil (1200 km 2 /MtCO 2 e on average) and Russia (10,700 km 2 /MtCO 2 e) exhibit greatest sensitivity in land cover changes to CO 2 emission changes.

      "abstract": "Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) is a critical parameter to reflect the trade-off relationship between water consumption and carbon sequestration. Generally, WUE is calculated as the ratio of gross primary productivity (GPP) or net primary production (NPP) to evapotranspiration (ET) or transpiration (T). These formulations, however, do not reflect the intermediate processes of vegetation water utilization. Here, by selecting typical ecosystems in Northwest China, a WUE chain framework was developed to decompose WUE into four intermediate processes: GPP/T, T/ET, ET/SW (SW refers to soil water), and SW/TWI (TWI refers to total water input). The variance decomposition method and structural equation model were used to attribute the changes in WUE. The results revealed that T/ET and ET/SW were the main processes driving WUE variance. The variance in ET/SW accounted for 55.5%, 49.1%, and 58.1% of the WUE variation in croplands, grasslands, and forests, respectively, whereas the variance in T/ET explained 46.0% of the WUE variation in shrublands. Regarding the factors controlling WUE and its intermediate processes, temperature enhanced the WUE of croplands and grasslands by affecting GPP/T and T/ET. Precipitation controlled forests WUE by regulating T/ET and SW/TWI. Elevated CO 2 primarily regulated the WUE of shrublands by impacting GPP/T, T/ET, and SW/TWI. The CO 2 fertilization effect was detected across all four ecosystems. This study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms causing spatial variability in WUE, enriching our understanding of the integrated water-carbon cycle.",

      "abstract": "The adverse effects of droughts have been a struggle for humanity from an early age and are still truly relevant problems. The efforts to understand, prevent, and mitigate the drought have motivated researchers to develop indicators, indices, and action plans for its management. The presented paper suggests a novel index entitled Survivability from Droughts Index (SDI) to evaluate quantitative and qualitative indicators that represent the WEF Nexus system as well as the pillars of sustainability: economy, social, institutional, and environmental aspects. The index consists of four main sub-indices, namely, perception, vulnerability, adaptability, and recoverability. Each of these defines the stages when engaging with drought. The SDI encapsulates the economic survivability capacity of the agricultural sector at the scale of a river basin, in the case of the Gediz River Basin (GBR), Türkiye. In GBR, the calculated SDI of a relatively wet year, 1982, is determined as 0.38. While in a relatively drier period, namely 1991-1992, the value drops to 0.31, in a recent year, 2023, the value increases to 0.48. The results of the paper both validate the historical droughts and indicate that survivability from droughts can be achieved by actions to improve the sub-indices of SDI. The overall framework of SDI demands various data and engagement with stakeholders, but the results represent a strong connection with the analyzed case study. The presented outcomes are most beneficial to the decision-makers to detect and prioritize their measurements, such as new investments, insurance policies in drought-vulnerable areas within the analyzed extent.",

To mitigate climate change and the growing risk of agroecological droughts, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is increasingly recognized as unavoidable. However, it remains unclear whether the increase of agroecological drought due to atmospheric CO 2 emissions will be symmetrically reversed by an equivalent atmospheric CDR. Here we investigate this question by utilizing an idealized atmospheric CO 2 emission and removal experiment from the CDR Model Intercomparison Project, involving eight Earth system models, and develop a new methodology to quantify climate hysteresis and reversibility. We find that drought increases in hotspot regions cannot be symmetrically reversed by an equivalent CDR: drought severity under the CDR pathway is 65% ± 30% greater than under the emission pathway; drought frequency increases are only partially reversed by 73% ± 18% when CO 2 emissions are balanced by equivalent CDR. Drought hysteresis and irreversibility are most pronounced in the Mediterranean, northern Central America, west and east southern Africa and southern Australia. Our findings imply irreversible drought impacts associated with CDR, highlighting the need for planning long-term drought adaptations.",

      "abstract": "Despite the increased frequency and intensity of meteorological droughts, Eurasian vegetation has demonstrated resilience during droughts or dry spells, possibly due to soil moisture retention from seasonal snowmelt. In this study, we present the first continental-scale investigation of quantifying this critical relationship through a comprehensive analysis of drought indices, snowmelt patterns, and soil moisture retention dynamics from 1960 to 2024. The results show that drought severity varies spatially, with southwestern Eurasia experiencing extreme short-term droughts [standardized precipitation index (SPI) < −2.5] and broader regions facing prolonged drought (SPI −1.5 to −1.0). Spring snowmelt exceeds 45 mm in eastern China, central/southern Russia, and northern Europe, while other regions receive less. This directly influences summer soil moisture, with high-snowmelt areas retaining more than 50 mm, compared to deficits of less than −25 mm in low-snowmelt zones such as southwestern Eurasia. Notably, summer precipitation shows weak correlations (r < −0.25) with soil moisture retention in drought-prone areas, highlighting snowmelt’s disproportionate importance. Furthermore, the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis confirms a strong snowmelt-soil moisture coupling in northern Eurasia (48.1% variance), but concerning trends emerge: snowmelt declines in Siberia and Scandinavia correspond with drying in central Asia and southern Europe. While central Russia shows increasing snowmelt, overall trends indicate reduced snowpack persistence and earlier melt timing. These changes threaten the historical balance between water availability and ecological needs. Our findings emphasize the need for adaptive water management strategies to offset the loss of spring snowmelt buffers, which serve as a natural drought defense in the mid- and high latitudes of Eurasia.",

The study proposes a multiple regression-based regionalization approach using morphometric variables from nearby gauged catchments. Two unmonitored catchments were simulated due to their agroclimatic importance. The GR4J model excelled at simulating daily runoff, yielding satisfactory NSE, KGE, and RMSE values in most validations. Although GR5J and GR6J offered benefits in complex scenarios, they struggled with extreme precipitation events. Parameter regionalization, involving catchment area, mean slope, and shape factor, effectively transferred information, with R 2 values from 0.68 to 0.99. Supported by a validated agroclimatic classification, this integrated approach underscores the value of combining regionalization and hydrological modeling in data-scarce catchments.

However, the spatial variability of snow cover loss in burned forests has been under characterized. Here, we use remotely sensed snow data to show that, under average winter conditions, snow melts earlier in the first year postfire in 99% of the snow zone. Postfire snow cover loss is more extreme in relatively low-elevation, warm environments compared to that in high-elevation, cold regions. Under +2°C of warming, 73% of the snow zone would experience more extreme earlier postfire snowmelt compared to historically average conditions. Regions with the largest shift earlier in postfire snowmelt timing under average climate conditions also have the largest shift earlier in postfire snowmelt under +2°C warming. The spatial variability in postfire snowmelt timing and exacerbated impact in projected warmer winters affect ecosystem water availability, snow albedo feedbacks, and snowmelt runoff forecasting essential to water resource management.",

      "abstract": "As Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are being increasingly employed to make important simulations in rainfall-runoff contexts, the demand for interpretability is increasing in the hydrology community. Interpretability is not just a scientific question, but rather knowing where the models fall flat, how to fix them, and how to explain their outcomes to scientific communities so that everyone understands how the model arrives at specific simulations This paper addresses these challenges by deciphering interpretable probabilistic DNNs utilizing the Deep Autoregressive Recurrent (DeepAR) and Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) for daily streamflow simulation across the continental United States (CONUS). We benchmarked TFT and DeepAR against conceptual to physics-based hydrologic models. In this setting, catchment physical attributes were incorporated into the training process to create physics-guided TFT and DeepAR configurations. Our proposed physics-guided configurations are also designed to aggregate the patterns across the entire data set, analyze the sensitivity of key catchment physical attributes and facilitate the interpretability of temporal dynamics in rainfall-runoff generation mechanisms. To assess the uncertainty, the modeling configurations were coupled with a quantile regression by adding Gaussian noise N(0,σ) $N\\,(0,\\sigma )$ with increasing standard deviation to the individual catchment attributes. Analysis suggested that the physics-guided TFT was superior in predicting daily streamflow compared to the original TFT and DeepAR as well as benchmark hydrologic models. Predictive uncertainty intervals effectively bracketed most of the observational data by simultaneous simulation of various percentiles (e.g., 10th, 50th, and 90th). Interpretable physics-guided TFT proved to be a strong candidate for CONUS daily streamflow simulations.",

      "abstract": "Drought has been putting enormous pressure on agriculture and food security, especially for African countries with inadequate monitoring. However, there is still a lack of standardization in the synthesized drought index, which could better monitor drought than normalized indices, as well as insufficient attention to the geographical backgrounds of weights. We aim to develop a Standardized Optimal Synthesized Drought Index (SOSDI) that will improve drought monitoring and reflect dominant factors. The standardization transforms the input variable distribution functions, with the constraint optimization to compute the weight. Weight matrices are suggested to examine the geospatial heterogeneity of the input variable. Assessment of SOSDI from several dimensions was implemented. SOSDI was applied to monitor the periodic drought in East Africa, where rain-fed agriculture was susceptible to seasonal alternation. The results confirmed that standardization was more effective than normalization in the synthesized drought index, and the average correlation between SOSDI with existing indices, soil moisture, and crop yield reached about 0.6, 0.7, and 0.7, respectively. The cyclical drought is well captured on the seasonal and annual scales, mostly during the long-dry season. SOSDI could capture drought evolution and had good resistance to disturbances. Overall, SOSDI demonstrated a strong capability in drought monitoring and enhanced the drought expression derived from vegetation and temperature more effectively, rather than just precipitation.",

      "abstract": "Extreme rainfall seasonality plays a critical role in vegetation growth, agricultural production, and water resource management. Under global warming, increasing attention has been paid to its seasonal shifts and nonstationarity characteristics. In our comprehensive research, we utilized daily precipitation data from approximately 2200 gauge stations across China to investigate the spatial patterns, interannual variability, and long-term changes in the seasonality characteristics of annual maximum daily precipitation from 1960 to 2018. In the northern river basins, such as Hai, Songliao, Yellow, and Northwest River Basins, extreme daily events exhibit lower magnitude but stronger seasonality, accompanied by later timing and less variability in the mean date. Conversely, the southern river basins, such as Yangtze, Pearl, and Southeast River Basins, display the opposite pattern. Trend analysis shows that the mean occurrence date of extreme precipitation has generally advanced across most basins. Changes in the seasonality index reveal a clear north-south contrast: in the Northern basins, seasonality has weakened, implying that extreme precipitation events become more dispersed throughout the year. In the Southern basins, seasonality has strengthened, with extreme precipitation becoming more concentrated. The seasonal pattern of total column water vapor (TCWV) partly explains the earlier timing of extremes, especially in northern and central regions.Notably, El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) exert a discernible influence on the seasonality of extreme precipitation. El Niño induces delayed extremes in the Huai and lower Yangtze River Basin, but earlier events in the Northwest and Pearl River Basin. Notable reduced SI during El Niño versus La Niña phases, indicating La Niña intensifies precipitation seasonality. This study plays a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of extreme precipitation events, ultimately promoting resilience and reducing vulnerabilities to weather-related disasters.",

However, previous studies have not characterized the whole response process of vegetation to drought, and there are uncertainties in their methods and indicators. In this study, we developed a new indicator system and derived the response modes of global vegetation to extreme drought. We examined the influence of environmental variables on the modes, as well as the temporal changes of vegetation's responses. We found that vegetation in low- and mid-latitude regions exhibited contrasting response modes to extreme drought. Long-term moisture played a dominant role in shaping the spatial patterns. Over the past 40 years, both the total loss and response time of global vegetation have increased with time. Among various biome types, tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests exhibited a mode of low maximum decrease and short response time to extreme drought, resulting in the lowest total loss, whereas temperate grasslands, savannas and shrublands demonstrated high vulnerability in both current and future trends, warranting great attention. These results provide valuable insights for a more comprehensive understanding of global vegetation's responses to extreme drought and for assessing the vulnerability of different biome types.",

      "abstract": "Droughts are increasing with climate change, affecting the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems and limiting their capacity to mitigate rising atmospheric CO 2 levels. However, there is still large uncertainty on the long-term impacts of drought on ecosystem carbon (C) cycling, and how this determines the effect of subsequent droughts. Here, we aimed to quantify how drought legacy affects the response of a heathland ecosystem to a subsequent drought for two life stages of Calluna vulgaris resulting from different mowing regimes. We imposed a subsequent drought in a long-term (20 years) drought field experiment combined with different mowing years. We hypothesised that drought legacy would reduce the impact of a subsequent drought on ecosystem respiration (ER) through shifts in microbial community composition, and we expected a stronger effect of drought legacy on building stage Calluna (mowed in 2013) than on seedlings (mowed in 2020), with knock-on effects for net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and ER. We found that drought legacy persistently shifted soil bacterial and fungal communities, but the subsequent drought had minimal effect. Drought legacy also shifted plant community composition, with the strongest effect of subsequent drought on the building stage of Calluna . Subsequent drought reduced all CO 2 fluxes independent of drought legacy, and this effect was most pronounced in the building stage of Calluna . The observed strong and persistent shifts in soil microbial communities as a result of 20 years of summer drought did not explain ecosystem CO 2 fluxes, which were determined by changes in plant communities. Thus, our findings show a mismatch between aboveground and belowground responses to drought, and highlight that older heathlands are more vulnerable to drought, reducing their CO 2 uptake capacity in the crucial phase of ecosystem C stock accumulation. These findings give insight into the consequences of long-term drought for ecosystem C cycling and its response to future drought.",

Moreover, LUE models represent environmental stresses inconsistently. We conducted a global-scale comparison of different combinations of temperature and water stress functions to systematically evaluate the impact on GPP estimates. Monthly observation data from 172 eddy covariance flux towers distributed around the world were combined with six stress functions drawn from three prominent LUE models (the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA), Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) to develop nine candidate schemes, and the model performance was evaluated according to the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) and root mean square error (RMSE). Globally, the best-performing configuration coupled the water stress function from VPM with the temperature stress function from CASA (R 2 = 0.721; RMSE = 55.4 g C·m −2 ·month −1 ). However, the model performance markedly varied with the vegetation types: temperature stresses were the principal limiting factor in forests, croplands, and wetlands, whereas water stresses were the principal limiting factor in arid and temperate grasslands. A feature importance analysis using the XGBoost algorithm corroborated this pattern. The differences among stress functions mainly originated from their input parameters. A sensitivity analysis revealed that GPP is most responsive to changes in the optimum temperature compared with water or temperature extremes. These findings underscore the need to tailor stress parameterization to specific climate zones and vegetation types. They provide clear guidance for improving GPP estimates based on remote sensing products and lay a foundation for the next generation of carbon-cycle models to consider the effects of climate change.",

      "abstract": "Monthly runoff prediction is crucial in water resource management, involving both short-term hydrological dynamics and long-term planning. It has a decisive impact on flood prevention, resource allocation, and ecological protection. In the context of increasing uncertainties in runoff due to climate change and human activities, accurate monthly runoff forecasting becomes even more essential. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel dual-channel parallel monthly runoff prediction deep neural network architecture-MamGA-built on the significant application value of deep neural networks in runoff prediction. The architecture first introduces the Mamba model, which employs a selection mechanism to achieve selective information propagation and suppression, effectively enhancing the processing capability of global feature information while reducing the computational complexity of modelling long sequences. Furthermore, this paper incorporates a Depth-gated Attention Layer that combines bidirectional depth-gated modules and linear attention mechanisms to address the shortcomings of the Mamba network in unidirectional information processing. Integrating an Embedded Coding layer and a Sequential Decoding layer constructs an efficient coding and decoding system, further strengthening the model’s ability to capture global features and temporal information. To validate the effectiveness and advancement of the MamGA model, this study selected the Manwan Station (MW), Xiaowan Station (XW) in China, and the Thunder Creek Station (TC) in the United States as experimental subjects. Five evaluation metrics were employed for comparative analysis against nine benchmark models. The experimental results indicate that the MamGA model exhibits significant superiority across all cases. For instance, at the MW station, compared to the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, the MamGA model reduced the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) by 33.08% and 23.93%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nash Efficiency Coefficient (NSE), correlation coefficient (R), and Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) improved by 8.41%, 3.93%, and 8.36%, respectively, with both R and NSE exceeding 0.9. The MamGA model also demonstrated significant performance improvements at other stations compared to the competing models. The study suggests that the MamGA model, as an advanced tool for monthly runoff prediction, can significantly enhance the accuracy of runoff forecasting, providing robust support for the optimal allocation and management of water resources",

In the western United States, increasing variability in streamflow and shifting hydrologic regimes have heightened concerns about flood susceptibility and long-term water security. This study aims to predict flood susceptibility and analyze multi-decadal trends in extreme streamflow events across 1,088 United States Geological Survey flow-monitoring stations. We employ an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework, integrating a random forest model with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to identify and interpret the dominant drivers of flood susceptibility. The XAI model achieved a high predictive performance (Area Under Curve = 0.92), offering a reliable probabilistic tool for hazard mitigation and emergency planning. SHAP analysis showed that low channel elevation, high discharge variability, and flatter slopes were the strongest predictors of flood susceptibility, jointly accounting for 53% of model importance. Additionally, a statistically significant positive trend in annual mean discharge emerged as another important predictor (7% SHAP contribution). Seasonal analysis further revealed that streams with lower summer and spring flow thresholds were particularly susceptible, as reduced channel capacity and flow volatility heightened flood potential. Spatially, flood susceptibility hotspots (with predicted susceptibility >50%) emerged along the Pacific slope, extending from coastal Washington through northern California, where low elevations and flat terrain facilitate water accumulation. Additional clusters were identified in interior mountainous regions, including the Sierra Nevada and Cascades. To complement station-level findings, we developed a county-level composite risk index incorporating flood hazard susceptibility, land cover, settlement patterns, population exposure, and social vulnerability. This probability-based XAI-driven framework provides a transparent and actionable tool for identifying at-risk areas, enabling targeted mitigation strategies and resilience-building efforts across the western United States.",

      "abstract": "Net ecosystem productivity (NEP), i.e., the balance between carbon uptake and respiration, is a critical indicator of ecosystem carbon dynamics under climate extremes. The effects of drought on ecosystem carbon fluxes were investigated via eddy covariance observations from 77 flux sites worldwide (FLUXNET2015, ChinaFLUX, and the Heihe network), with drought quantified on the basis of the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) across multiple timescales ranging from 1-12 months (SPEI-1 to SPEI-12). The results revealed that ecosystems were most sensitive to short-term drought (1-3 months), with most sites exhibiting maximum carbon flux-SPEI correlations. Although short-term moisture variability drove immediate responses in carbon fluxes, the cumulative moisture stress over seasonal timescales (SPEI-6) indicated a significant threshold response in these fluxes: relative to normal conditions (SPEI-6 > − 0.5), the NEP increased slightly under mild to moderate drought conditions (−1.5 < SPEI-6 ≤ − 0.5). However, for SPEI-6 ≤ − 1.5 (severe drought), the NEP decreased sharply, indicating that adaptive mechanisms were compromised beyond the critical SPEI-6 threshold of − 1.5. Notably, wetlands (WET) and mixed forests (MF) maintained their carbon-sink functions even under severe drought, indicating substantial drought resistance through hydrological buffering and functional diversity. Moreover, the results of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis revealed that the leaf area index (LAI) was the main regulator of the NEP, contributing approximately 30 % under both nondrought and drought conditions. Relative to normal conditions, drought modulated the controls on carbon fluxes: the importance of canopy conductance (Gc) increased from 17.93 % to 25.52 % (+7.59 percentage points), whereas the importance of net radiation (Rn) decreased from 19.81 % to 9.09 % (−10.72 percentage points), indicating a transition from energy to water limitation in terms of ecosystem carbon dynamics. These findings establish a critical seasonal drought threshold for ecosystem carbon dynamics and capture the shift from energy to water limitation in carbon flux regulation, offering actionable insights for ecosystem management and drought resilience strategies.",

      "abstract": "Meiyu is a special precipitation anomaly taking place in China, Japan, and Korea. In China, Meiyu always happens in the lower reaches (LR) of the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). Its traditional characteristics have changed in recent years with global warming. Meiyu is getting more and more extreme. It potentially threatened the energy supply. But precise projections are still lacking. A Meiyu projection and risk analysis approach (MPRA) is developed in this study. It is aimed to give a comprehensive picture of future Meiyu considering multiple synoptic patterns (SPs) based on statistical downscaling and K-means clustering. Multilevel Meiyu recurrence risks will be quantified by the Copula function, and the effects on food, energy and water resources will be discussed. Results suggest that the future Meiyu will last longer and have much more rainfall compared with the 2000s (i.e., 1985-2014). Considering four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), Meiyu will be most severe under SSP585, with 16.27 days and 38.19 mm/grid more than in the 2000s. The high-pressure anomalies around YRB can easily trigger long-duration and high-intensity Meiyu. The multilevel heavy Meiyu (i.e., with 5, 10, 20, and 50 return periods) will keep increasing only under SSP585 in the 21st century, with 10 times increase in total conditional probabilities. Intensified Meiyu will threaten food and water energy, but somehow drive the energy transition. It is suggested to implement emission reduction to mitigate climate change and improve the resilience to Meiyu risks.",

      "abstract": "Compound precipitation-wind extremes (CPWEs) pose significant socio-economic challenges in urban areas, with the most severe impacts often felt by vulnerable populations. While CPWE studies have often focused on large-scale assessments, localised urban contexts, at a scale of a city and its suburban surroundings, remain understudied, particularly in terms of how CPWEs might differentially impact different socio-economic communities. This study aims to advance understanding of how CPWEs interact with social vulnerability at a localised scale, using the San Francisco Bay Area (SFBA)-a global hotspot for CPWEs with diverse climates, physiography, and socio-economic factors-as a test case. Daily precipitation and wind speed data (~4 km) from the gridMET dataset (1982-2022) were used to identify CPWEs during the wet season (October-April). Patterns of CPWE event frequency and trends were then analysed. We found that the return period for CPWEs in the SFBA ranges from 0.5 to 2 years, suggesting nearly annual occurrences. Over recent decades, these events have become more frequent (an increase of two events per decade) and more intense, particularly in terms of daily precipitation trends (an increase of 0-5 mm/decade), across the SFBA. We further examined the connection between CPWEs and social vulnerability using the Social Vulnerability Index from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, considering factors such as socio-economic status, household characteristics, racial and ethnic composition, housing conditions, and access to transportation. Key urban centres, such as San José and Oakland, emerged as hotspots where high CPWE frequency coincides with high levels of social vulnerability due to economic constraints, inadequate housing, and limited transportation access. These findings underscore the need for targeted adaptation measures to protect populations most at risk in the SFBA.",

This study introduces a daily drought-flood abrupt alternation index (DFAI) to overcome these challenges. Using a gridded observational dataset and simulations from five global climate models (GCMs), we analyse the spatiotemporal characteristics and evolution of DFAA events across mainland China. Validation against historical disaster records shows that the daily DFAI detects DFAA events missed by the monthly DFAI; and identifies the Southwest Monsoon Convergence Zone as a high-frequency hotspot, contrasting with the fragmented patterns of the monthly index analyses. Long-term trend analysis reveal significant nationwide increases in DFAA frequency and intensity; under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5), the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP3b) projections indicate no overall increase in future DFAA frequency but a consistent intensification, particularly under SSP5-8.5, where mainland China may experience stronger events. The improved index enables higher-resolution DFAA detection and supports enhanced risk assessment and adaptive strategies for managing compound hydrometeorological hazards.",

However, ecological drought, as a vivid manifestation of an ecoclimatic event, is not adequately understood with respect to its spatiotemporal evolutions and risk assessment in a warming climate. Leveraging the simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways with modest and higher emission scenarios (i.e., SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5), we used the standardized ecological water shortage index (SEWDI), based on the ecological water deficit to characterize the ecological drought over Northwestern China (NWC). For assessing the change in risk of ecological drought under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios over NWC, the characteristics of ecological drought were extracted via the three thresholds in run theory, and then the corresponding risk indicators were calculated. Results showed that SEWDI can be utilized to effectively characterize the ecological drought over NWC. The decrement rate of severity for the ecological drought exceeded -0.02/10a over NWC in the middle future (i.e., the period 2051-2075) under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. The regions with higher (lower) risk of ecological drought were mainly located in the western and central (eastern) parts of NWC under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, especially a larger ecological drought risk would occur under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. In comparison with the historical period 1982-2014, the projected ecological drought risk over NWC pronounced increased under these two projected scenarios. These findings have implications for coping with the potential ecoclimatic risk of droughts.",

However, there is a knowledge gap in how short-term extreme events, such as atmospheric heat waves (AHWs), impact stream temperatures, particularly for headwater streams that are important habitats for endangered salmon. This study investigates the response of four headwater streams in the Oregon Coast Range to AHWs. The average number of AHWs per year for the study period (2012-2022) at each site varied between 5 and 6. Four years (2014, 2015, 2016, and 2021) had more AHWs than average. Based on seasonal averages, 18 AHWs occurred in spring, 11 in summer, and 14 in both fall and winter. Average daily air temperature (mean for all sites by season) during AHWs was 14.8°C in fall, 19.4°C in spring, 22.4°C in summer, and 12.0°C in winter. Stream temperatures were significantly elevated (above 95% exceedance for the DOY) at all sites in all seasons during AHWs. However, stream temperatures in the post-AHW period (defined as the period 8-14 days after an AHW event) were not significantly elevated except in the fall (October-December), when stream temperatures remained significantly elevated at all sites. Thermal sensitivity, defined as the slope of the linear regression between stream temperature and air temperature, was used to assess the relationship between stream temperature and air temperature. Across sites, thermal sensitivity ranged from 0.34°C/°C to 0.69°C/°C in spring, 0.34°C/°C to 0.59°C/°C in summer, 0.36°C/°C to 0.50°C/°C in fall, and 0.21°C/°C to 0.34°C/°C in winter. In all seasons, AHWs are associated with significant increases in stream temperature and may result in persistent warming during periods of low flow, with potential impacts to aquatic ecosystems.",

In this study, a framework is presented which adopted a three-dimensional identification method by accounting for spatiotemporal continuity to identify MD and AD and quantify their intensity. The compound droughts are detected through spatiotemporal matching and their spatiotemporal propagation potential is characterized by defining the compound drought duration ( CD ) and the compound drought affected area ( CA ). Then, a four-dimensional C-vine copula with three conditional factors, namely meteorological drought intensity ( I MD ), CD , and CA is constructed to assess the triggering probability of AD by MD. The results for the framework applied in Naoli River Basin, Northeast China, showed that 45 compound drought events were detected among all MD and AD events from 1982 to 2017. These compound droughts were characterized by strong spatiotemporal coupling between MD and AD. CD quantified drought persistence, whereas CA represented its spatial extent. Both CD and CA are essential variables for understanding the propagation of MD into AD. Under specific I MD , CA is positively correlated with triggering probability of AD, while CD exhibits a nonlinear hierarchical phenomena: CD < 3 months, the probability of extreme AD is close to 0; CD ≥ 5 months, the probability of extreme AD remains significantly high even with lower I MD . Consequently, proactive interventions during the initial stages of drought propagation is critical for effective drought management. The framework incorporating CD and CA can effectively capture the complex spatiotemporal processes of drought propagation and reduce biases associated with single conditional factor assessments. The framework could provide valuable guidance for AD probability assessment and disaster management in other regions.",

Existing wisdom explains the geographic likelihood of these floods, but falls short in determining when they can be anticipated. Here we identify synoptic origins (referring to large-scale weather patterns and the associated rainfall processes) of extreme floods by analyzing a large catalog of flood-producing storms over the North China Plain. The most extreme floods are associated with a northward and westward extension of the Subtropical High, providing favorable synoptic conditions for predecessor rainfall processes, despite their relatively low frequency of occurrence. Low-level moisture convergence modulated by both regional topography and synoptic forcing dictates the spatiotemporal variability of extreme rainfall. We reveal a critical dependence of basin-scale flood controls on synoptic origins of extreme floods. Our analysis provides process-driven insights into the tail behavior of flood peaks that can inform flood risk management.",

It is replenished by precipitation and transported back to the atmosphere through land surface evaporation and vegetation transpiration. Soil moisture is, therefore, influenced by both precipitation and evapotranspiration, with spatial heterogeneities and seasonal variations across different ecological zones. The relationship between soil moisture and precipitation was found to be nonlinear and negative in Northern Hemisphere ecosystems. However, the driving mechanisms of these negative correlations, especially how soil moisture is influenced by precipitation and evapotranspiration, still remain unclear. This study quantified the spatiotemporal distribution of the nonlinear dependence of soil moisture to precipitation, and identify the dominant factors in different ecoregions to explore the driving mechanisms and regional patterns. The joint distributions of precipitation and soil moisture were analyzed at monthly and annual scales, using soil moisture and precipitation data from ERA5-Land and Global Precipitation Climatology Project, respectively. The nonlinear negative dependences reached to 19.2 %, 0.7 %, and 2.3 % at monthly scale, while were 3.0 %, 4.0 %, and 8.6 % at annual scale, respectively, for the three soil layers. These negative dependences were shown to be most prominent in temperate grasslands, savannas, shrublands, deserts, xeric shrublands, and tundra regions, where driven by the land surface temperature and by the air temperature-gross primary production relationship at the monthly scale based on Ridge regression models and Bayesian models. Additionally, the negative dependence is also linked to freeze-thaw cycles, precipitation seasonality, and temperature fluctuations, which lead to asynchronous changes between soil moisture and precipitation at the seasonal scale. At the annual scale, the negative dependence was associated with long-term changes in precipitation and temperature that affect vegetation and surface properties, by altering soil water capacity. These findings enhance the understanding of land-atmosphere interactions providing a valuable basis for future research on drought, hydrometeorology, and ecological conservation.",

      "abstract": "Decadal changes in terrestrial surface wind speed since the 1960s have been extensively documented, while the mechanism and the extent of their impacts on terrestrial ecosystem productivity remain unclear. Here, we systematically explore the impacts of wind speed changes on terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) using satellite-derived data, reanalysis datasets, flux tower observations, CMIP6 models, and exploratory simulation experiments. Our results show a negative sensitivity of terrestrial GPP to wind speed change, ranging from −156.67 to −65.82 g C m −2 yr −1 (m s −1 ) −1 , across different data sources from 1983 to 2100. This is mainly attributed to the impacts of wind speed decline on stomatal conductance by reducing atmospheric dryness and soil drying. We find that during 1983 - 2010, wind speed decline is the most important factor, after rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, in its contribution to the increasing trend in GPP (6.0% -7.8%). With further declines in wind speed, this contribution to GPP is projected to rank between second and third during 2031 - 2100. Among seven plant functional types, grasslands contribute most to the wind-induced changes in the GPP trend under current and future climates. These findings highlight the substantial effects of wind speed on centennial-scale global carbon dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Cascading drought-flood events (CDFEs), also referred to as “drought-to-flood transitions” or “drought-flood abrupt alternations,” in which a flood follows a period of drought, may have different flood generation mechanisms than floods occurring independently from drought, as the drought could affect soil infiltration rates and, consequently, runoff dynamics. With the increasing frequency of extreme weather events driven by climate change, understanding the cascading nature of drought and flood events has become crucial for effective disaster risk management. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on how these drought-flood interactions work and translate to economic losses. This study addresses this gap by identifying CDFEs and flood-only events (FEs) across Central Europe and linking them to their flood impacts from the modelled Historical Analysis of Natural Hazards in Europe (HANZE) database. CDFEs are associated with significantly higher maximum daily mean streamflow (58.51 m3/s vs. 38.20 m3/s), deeper mean water depths (1.90m vs. 1.88m), and greater economic losses (€33.09 million/km2 vs. €29.75 million/km2) compared to FEs. These findings underscore the special features of cascading drought-flood events and the need to take them into account in flood risk management.",

However, its extent and severity remain insufficiently quantified across global, regional, and national scales. Here we integrate annual aridity-index-based dryland classifications to indicate potential desertification areas, apply land cover conversion to bare areas to identify desertified areas, and use high-resolution population data to estimate both the number and spatial distribution of populations exposed to desertification at multiple scales. Between 2001 and 2018, the global desertified area increased by 5,387.8 ± 383.5 km 2 yr −1 , while the exposed population grew by 126,857 ± 6,723 people yr −1 . Population exposure exhibits pronounced spatial heterogeneity, particularly at the national level. As desertified areas expand, more people, who lack the resources to migrate, become increasingly dependent on degraded land, thereby further accelerating land degradation. This self-reinforcing feedback loop complicates efforts to achieve land degradation neutrality by 2030, as outlined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. By explicitly incorporating hyper-arid areas and linking ecosystem service loss with population exposure, this study develops a cross-scale analytical framework that enhances the assessment of desertification exposure and offers new insights into global desertification risks.",

Temporal crop diversification-rotating multiple species over time-has been proposed to improve soil health and water retention based on field-scale experiments. However, widespread adoption remains limited on farms, in part due to unverified benefits at larger scales. Here, we assess the influence of crop diversification on agricultural water-use efficiency (WUE, ratio of gross primary productivity to evapotranspiration) along a spectrum of monoculture to complex species rotations in California. Leveraging new high-resolution remote sensing datasets, we show that crop diversification is a key driver of agricultural WUE, and increasing the number of species planted in the previous six years from two to four increases WUE by ~20% after accounting for differences between crops. Our results provide spatially explicit, large-scale quantification of crop diversification's improvements to WUE, with direct implications for climate adaptation. More broadly, our framework offers a tool to evaluate other sustainable practices and guide policy and farm-scale decision-making.",

To quantitatively assess changes in grassland fire susceptibility under future climate scenarios, this study used historical fire data and CMIP6 model data, combined with multiple regression and the MaxEnt model, to simulate the distribution and trend of NDVI and fire susceptibility. Results showed that NDVI decreased under the low emission scenario (SSP119), and NDVI of grassland with medium and low coverage increased under medium and high emission scenarios (SSP245 and SSP585), while that of high coverage grassland decreased slightly. Fire susceptibility was higher in the east and south, and lower in the Qaidam Basin and northwest, with wind speed, distance from settlements, NDVI, slope, and human footprint as main driving factors. Mann-Kendall and Theil-Sen slope analyses showed that future fire susceptibility areas under medium- and high-emission scenarios increased significantly and fluctuated, concentrating in the periphery of the Qaidam Basin and Southern Qinghai Plateau. Risk varied significantly among grasslands of different coverage. The study reveals the impact of global emission pathways on regional fire risk, emphasizing the need to strengthen adaptation, mitigation, and optimize grassland fire prevention to safeguard ecological security of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.",

      "abstract": "As climate change intensifies, extreme weather increasingly threatens California’s Central Valley (CV), a vital agricultural region exposed to rising risks from heatwaves (HW), droughts (DR), and compound extremes. These events disrupt crop productivity and broader processes like water demand, pest dynamics, and soil stability, posing systemic risks. This study examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of HW, coldwaves (CW), DR, excessive rainfall (ER), and their compound (e.g., HWDR) and cascading forms from 1951 to 2025, using NOAA nClimGrid-Daily data. We assessed trends in frequency, intensity, and duration over long-term (1951-2025) and mid-term (1981-2025) periods. Results show increasing HW and DR in the southern CV, with 35 % and 60 % of the region exhibiting strong upward trends in HW frequency and intensity (mid-term), respectively, linked to warming (+0.234 °C/decade) and precipitation variability. Northern CV, especially Tehama to Sacramento, shows greater vulnerability to ER, CWDR, and CWER, reflecting heightened climate variability. Hotspots of extremes are shifting northward, with HWDR migrating at 20.94 km/decade. June-July HW and DR peaks coincide with critical crop stages, while February-March rainfall supports early vegetation growth. Almonds showed the highest vulnerability to drought, with severe kNDVI anomaly drops in 2014, while grapes responded moderately to heat and benefited from early rain, reaching a kNDVI anomaly peak of 0.03 in 2005. Intra-annual analysis reveals that 2014′s extreme HW and DR, combined with low rainfall and groundwater decline, intensified stress during hull split and fruit set. Targeted strategies like precision irrigation and drought-tolerant cultivars are essential to enhance agricultural resilience.",

This study analyzed LST variations and their response to key biogeophysical factors-Albedo, evapotranspiration (ET), leaf area index (LAI), and soil moisture (SM)-across forests, grasslands, and croplands from 2000 to 2020. LST exhibited distinct daily (daytime vs. nighttime) and seasonal (growing vs. non-growing seasons) trend patterns. While annual LST remained stable (Slope (S) =0.0014 K/yr, p > 0.05), significant seasonal contrasts emerged: cooling during growing seasons ( S = -0.05 K/yr, p  0.05). Diurnal asymmetry was evident, with daytime LST cooling ( S =-0.106 K/yr, p < 0.05) and nighttime LST warming ( S = 0.064 K/yr, p = 0.06). Grasslands showed unique warming trends in both annual ( S = 0.093 K/yr, p = 0.08) and non-growing seasons ( S = 0.22 K/yr, p < 0.05), contrasting with cooling in croplands and forests. The reduction in daytime LST was primarily driven by ET, contributing -0.08 K/yr, while the increase in nighttime LST was mainly regulated by Albedo, with a contribution of 0.07 K/yr. During growing seasons, SM was the key driver of cooling, contributing -0.028 K/yr. In contrast, LST warming in the non-growing seasons was co-regulated by Albedo (0.038 K/yr) and LAI (0.059 K/yr). Compared to croplands and forests, grasslands exhibited increasing LST in annual and non-growing season, largely influenced by Albedo (0.07 K/yr), ET (0.05K/yr), and LAI (0.1 K/yr). These findings highlighted the role of the biogeophysical effects of vegetation and land-use types in shaping LST variations, offering critical insights for climate-land interactions and sustainable land management.",

      "abstract": "Elevated air temperature and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) are key drivers of plant physiological and ecological processes. However, their relative impacts on vegetation productivity remain difficult to isolate due to the strong coupling between them. This coupling complicates efforts to disentangle independent effects, particularly under compound drought conditions at regional or global scales. We used solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and gross primary productivity as proxies for vegetation productivity from 2000 to 2023. Causal relationships among factors and between each factor and SIF were first identified using the convergent cross mapping method. These relationships were then integrated into a partial least squares structural equation model to disentangle the relative effects of air temperature and VPD on SIF. Additionally, we used CMIP6 data under future scenarios to assess their respective future contributions. Our results show that VPD has a dominant negative effect on vegetation productivity. In contrast, air temperature generally exerts a positive influence when the interaction between the two variables is excluded. However, the interaction between VPD and air temperature weakens the positive effect of warming. Furthermore, the adverse impacts of VPD are intensified by other climatic factors. Future projections under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios indicate a continued intensification of VPD’s negative effects and a gradual decline in the positive influence of air temperature by the end of the 21st century. Our study highlights the critical role of VPD in regulating ecosystem functioning. It clarifies the individual contributions of air temperature and VPD to vegetation productivity and underscores the growing threat posed by VPD under global warming, particularly in mid-latitude regions. These findings provide important insights for vegetation management and climate change mitigation strategies.",

      "abstract": "The Yellow River Basin (YRB) is characterized by water scarcity, emphasizing the critical necessity for a comprehensive understanding of the effects of evapotranspiration (ET) on regional precipitation. Despite the vegetation greening phenomenon leading to a considerable rise in ET, uncertainties still exist regarding its effects on precipitation at the regional scale. To address this research gap, we integrated GLEAM ET and UTrack data, and found a significant increase in the ET rate of 1.06 mm/yr 2 in the YRB from 1980 to 2020. Notably, ET contributes 107 mm/yr of precipitation locally, constituting 20 % of the total, with the primary contributions coming from the upper and middle regions. Transpiration accounts for approximately 15 % of the total precipitation, underscoring the significant role played by vegetation transpiration in the YRB. Moreover, our findings indicate that ET contributes 63, 23, 20, and 20 mm/yr of precipitation to the Haihe River Basin, Yangtze Basin, Huaihe River Basin, and Songliao River Basin, respectively. Compared to 1980−1984, the increased ET led to around 11 mm/yr of additional precipitation during 2016−2020, effectively counterbalancing one-third of the ET increase observed. We further illustrated a schematic diagram depicting the water cycle in the YRB, emphasizing the reinforcement of the vertical water cycle within the basin. This study significantly advances our knowledge of hydrological processes at the basin scale, highlighting the crucial supplementary effect of ET. Such insights are instrumental in guiding scientific planning related to ecological restoration and water resource management.",

Here we use satellite-derived water isotope observations and physical models to trace atmospheric moisture origins for major global rain-fed crops from 2003 to 2019, distinguishing between oceanic and terrestrial sources. Our analysis shows that the fraction of rainwater originating from land ( f ) varies both geographically and seasonally, with an important threshold at ~36%. Regions with higher f , that is, more dependent on land-originating water, are more prone to insufficient rainwater supply and soil moisture deficits during the main growing season. Crops in these regions show higher sensitivity to hydroclimate-with reduced productivity in lower-rainfall years-and a higher likelihood of drought. Notably, more than 40% of global maize and 60% of winter wheat is grown in regions where rainfall depends heavily on land-originating moisture ( f ≥ 36%), underscoring the vulnerability of key staple crops to hydroclimate stress. Our results highlight the importance of managing local land moisture sources and reveal where targeted water management strategies would be most expected to enhance agricultural resilience.",

      "abstract": "Accurately predicting runoff responses in ungauged catchments remains a central challenge in hydrology, particularly for regions lacking sufficient observational data. The regionalization approach is a powerful strategy to address this challenge, enabling the extrapolation of knowledge derived from gauged catchments to ungauged locations. However, the development of robust regionalization models is often constrained by limited datasets, in terms of the number of catchments and/or the availability of catchment attributes. Despite recent advancements, most existing studies evaluate model performance using subsets of the same dataset for both training and testing, limiting the assessment of model transferability. To address this gap, this study introduces a regionalization framework using the large-scale CAMELS-US dataset to train a set of regression models for predicting the calibrated parameters of the GR2M, a monthly water balance model. The framework is then evaluated on the CAMELS-GB (Great Britain dataset), representing a distinct climatic and geographic context beyond continental boundaries. A critical aspect of this study is its focus on uncovering the physical meaning of the GR2M parameters by linking them to measurable catchment attributes. Results show that while linear regression models perform well within the training domain, their predictive skill declines significantly when applied to the GB dataset. In contrast, machine learning models, particularly Support Vector Regression, demonstrate strong generalization capabilities, achieving high accuracy in predicting runoff responses across GB catchments. These findings underscore the importance of nonlinear approaches in developing globally transferable regionalization frameworks and underscore their potential to support reliable hydrologic predictions in data-scarce regions.",

Interpreting relationships between watershed characteristics, hydrologic regimes, and model performance can reveal potential areas for model improvement. In this study, we use machine learning to assess model performance of a regional hydrologic model to forecast the occurrence of streamflow drought. We demonstrate our methodology using a regional long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning model developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and data from 384 streamgages across the Colorado River Basin region. Performance was assessed by clustering catchments using: (a) physical and climatological catchment attributes, and (b) streamflow drought signatures time series. We examined the association of USGS LSTM model error measures with clusters generated by both approaches to interpret meaningful spatial and temporal information about LSTM model performance. Clustering static catchment attributes identified elevation, degree of streamflow regulation, baseflow contribution, catchment aridity, and drainage area as the most influential attributes to model performance. Clustering gages by their drought signatures revealed that catchments with significant seasonal peak runoff between January and June generally exhibited better model performance. Additionally, a Random Forest classifier was trained to successfully predict LSTM model performance (F1 score of 0.72) based on physical and climatological catchment attributes. Low degree of flow regulation was identified as a key indicator of better LSTM model performance. These findings point to the opportunities for improving the USGS LSTM model performance in future hydrologic drought prediction efforts across regional and CONUS scales.",

Across the western U.S., low peak SWE is associated with wider streamflow distributions at 63%-85% of gages, depending on measure used to assess the temporal distribution of streamflow ( p FDR < 0.1 at 43%-61%). Effects are consistent in sign but not magnitude using snow pillow data.

Our model predicts an annual GPP in CONUS rivers of 10.1 teragrams of carbon per year and an ER of 18.7 teragrams of carbon per year, which implies that net ecosystem productivity (NEP; where NEP = GPP - ER) is a small contributor to river carbon dioxide emissions. More than 70% of river metabolism occurs in the West, where regions of both extreme heterotrophy and autotrophy exist. Autotrophy is prominent across the West and is sensitive to drought, particularly in understudied biomes such as arid desert shrublands, which may indicate that global riverine uptake of carbon dioxide is higher than hypothesized.",

Understanding the interactions among atmosphere, ocean, climate, and soil is therefore necessary for water resource management, drought monitoring, and disaster prevention. Assessing those interactions so far primarily focused on dynamic climate models and statistic models. However, the former model is proven to have well-known biases in simulating both the strength and the timing of rainfall in GHOA, and the latter model often fails to discover causal relationship due to autocorrelation and high dimensionality within time series variables. Here, we use a data driven causal graph discovery algorithm called PCMCI+ to discover causal relationships among El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) teleconnection patterns, precipitation, temperature and soil moisture (SM) during 1980-2022 over drought-prone GHOA. Additionally, we quantitatively calculated the causal effects of teleconnection patterns on SM mediated through different climate paths, and the correlation with regional drought conditions are further explored. Results suggest that IOD generally presents higher causal effects on climate variables (temperature and precipitation) or on SM through both climate pathways than ENSO over most parts of GHOA, and the strongest correlation with drought conditions are generally found during different IOD phases. Moreover, precipitation is a more vital path through which teleconnection patterns causally impact SM in GHOA. Our study provides the first attempt to quantitatively analyze the causal effects of teleconnection patterns on SM through both precipitation and temperature pathways, and it highlights the causal relationships within atmosphere-ocean-climate-soil interactions, which could help for better understanding of climate change impact on drought over GHOA.",

      "abstract": "The mathematical complexity of climate modelling presents significant challenges to teaching climate change at the undergraduate level. Here we address this challenge with the Cambio climate model, a set of ordinary time-dependent differential equations that simulate carbon exchanges between Earth’s atmosphere, ocean, and land reservoirs. Students obtain solutions to versions of these equations that embed a series of feedbacks, progressively adding i) temperature-dependent Henry’s Law equilibration of CO 2 between oceans and atmosphere, ii) reductions in global albedo as parameterized by anticipated reductions in Earth’s cryosphere, and iii) reductions in the efficiency of terrestrial CO 2 fertilization parameterized by observed changes in net atmosphere-to-land CO 2 fluxes. As validation, we find that the range of anthropogenic warming produced by this progression plausibly replicates the range of published warming values, even for a fixed Charney equilibrium climate sensitivity. We have found that students taking an undergraduate general education course on modeling Earth’s climate with minimal prerequisites and no programming experience can learn the necessary programming skills to write the code to create Cambio from the ground up. Creating and implementing Cambio themselves helps students develop skills needed to understand the nonlinear processes inherent in climate dynamics, including feedbacks, time delays, reservoir stocks, and flows between reservoirs. We also describe an analytical solution to the Cambio equations that reproduces observed log-linear increases in atmospheric and oceanic carbon reservoirs. We conclude with pedagogical insights regarding the use of scaffolded Python/Jupyter Notebooks, as a way to reach a wide range of students.",

      "abstract": "Rapid urbanization and income growth are reshaping domestic water demand across Asian megacities. Accordingly, we developed an integrated system dynamics model at the city scale to reconstruct the domestic water demand and supply for 42 megacities from 2015 to 2035. The cities were clustered into five archetypes based on climatic conditions, technological advancement (TA), wastewater reuse (WR), and economic growth trajectories, and uncertainty was quantified using a Monte Carlo (MC) ensemble. We summarized this uncertainty by reporting the 5th-95th percentile range of key risk metrics for each city and synthesized four indicators, namely shortage depth, frequency, probability, and urgency, into a composite vulnerability index (CVI). Our results revealed the concentration of demand growth in South Asia and the Pearl River region, whereas East Asian megacities exhibited flat or declining trajectories. The MC analysis indicated a near-universal risk, with the median probability of at least one shortfall defined as a water supply-to-demand ratio (WSDR) <1 between 2015 and 2035 at 1.00 for every archetype. Furthermore, archetypes 1, 2, 4, and 5 were projected to remain below sufficiency for nearly the entire period, whereas archetype 3 would sustain sufficiency for a median of 16 years. Minimum WSDR medians ranged from 0.44 (in archetype 2) to 0.83-0.85 in buffered cities like Hong Kong and Shanghai. CVI spanned 27.6-80.0 across the cities, with Chennai, Shenzhen, Surat, Bengaluru, and Kolkata ranking highest, and Chongqing, Shanghai, Hyderabad, Hong Kong, Nagoya, and Tokyo ranking lowest. The archetype-level CVI was highest for archetypes 2 and 1 and lowest for archetype 3. Our findings highlight that large-scale TA consistently improves WSDR, whereas the effects of WR remain heterogeneous and context-dependent. We also confirmed climate variability to be a persistent stressor. Overall, this framework offers comparable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics to prioritize efficiency, reuse integration, and supply augmentation programs across diverse urban contexts.",

Past studies on precipitation have focused on precipitation or drought indices, neglecting 400 mm isohyet fluctuations. This paper defines its global fluctuation range, creates the Precipitation Line Fluctuation Intensity (PFI) Index, detects spatio-temporal migrations in typical regions, and explores regional differences and drivers to assess climate change. Results show PFI 400 exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity, with the strongest fluctuations observed in Australia and the weakest in western South America. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and topography are identified as the primary factors influencing these fluctuations, with PDO being the most widely affecting dynamic factor, especially on short-term scales. The study reveals that regions with strong fluctuations are often influenced by the coupled effects of multiple factors, such as temperature, wind speed, and atmospheric circulation. Moreover, the 400 mm isohyet is migrating rapidly toward higher values in western North America and northern Africa, potentially increasing drought risks. These findings underscore the complexity of precipitation line fluctuations, enhancing the theoretical framework for precipitation variability and offering critical insights for water resource management and climate adaptation in arid, semi-arid, agricultural, and pastoral regions under climate change.",

Here, we propose a framework to map annual changes in soil carbon and litter (SOCL) as the difference between the net land CO 2 flux from atmospheric inversions and satellite-based maps of biomass changes. We show that SOCL accumulated globally at a rate of about 0.34 ± 0.30 ( ± 1 sigma) billion tonnes of carbon per year (PgC yr − 1 ) during 2011-2020. The largest SOCL sink is found in boreal regions (0.93 ± 0.45 PgC yr − 1 in total) particularly in undisturbed peatlands and managed forests. The largest losses occur in the dry tropics (−0.50 ± 0.47 PgC yr − 1 ) and correspond with agricultural expansion from land use change, cropland management and grazing. By contrast, forests in the wet tropics act as a net soil carbon sink (0.32 ± 0.35 PgC yr − 1 ). Our findings highlight the large mitigation opportunities in the dry tropics to restore agricultural soil carbon.",

Accordingly, large ensembles-which allow internally-generated variations to be averaged out-are essential for assessing the response of ENSO to external forcing. In this study, we analyze state-of-the-art large-ensemble simulations from CMIP6 climate models and show that, in most models, ENSO frequency increases under anthropogenic warming. Two factors drive this frequency increase. First, a shift toward the Eastern Pacific (EP) El Niño pattern-characterized by higher frequencies and greater amplitudes relative to the Central Pacific (CP) pattern. Second, an overall increase in the frequency of both EP and CP variability. These changes scale with the intensity of anthropogenic forcing. Most models also exhibit ENSO strengthening that begins in the 20th $20\\text{th}$ century and continues throughout the 21st $21\\text{st}$ century. Consequently, the observed intensification of ENSO during the second half of the 20th $20\\text{th}$ century could be of anthropogenic origin.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the accuracy of long-term water demand projections and tracks the evolution of water demand management incentives across 61 California water suppliers from 2000 to 2020. Through a systematic analysis of Urban Water Management Plans, we find that water suppliers consistently overestimated future demand by an average of 25% for 5-year projections and 74% for 20-year projections. This overestimation stems primarily from assumptions about per capita water demand rather than population growth estimates. While suppliers generally projected stable or increasing per capita demand, actual water demand per capita declined by 1.9% annually between 2000 and 2020, leading to a decoupling of water demand from population growth. Concurrently, we document a substantial increase in water demand management incentives, with non-voluntary regulations emerging as the dominant demand management approach by 2020, largely driven by state policies like the Model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance and California Green Building Standards. Demand management efforts have evolved from primarily indoor and educational initiatives toward outdoor-focused non-voluntary regulations and rebates. This shift appears closely linked to the reduction in per capita demand that suppliers failed to fully capture in their water demand projections. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating dynamic conservation trends into demand projections and suggest that suppliers should develop more sophisticated forecasting methods that account for the continuing evolution of water efficiency incentives. This research provides valuable insights for water resource planners seeking to improve the accuracy of water demand projections in an era of increasing conservation and climate uncertainty.",

We analyze changes in baseflow ( BF ) and stormflow ( SF ) in 3,388 watersheds globally in the response to changes in precipitation characteristics, vegetation (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI ), temperature, potential evapotranspiration, and the aridity index from 1982 to 2016, based on Random Forest Model simulations and Shapley Additive Explanations. We also evaluate the effects of anthropogenic climate change on changes in baseflow index ( BFI , the ratio of baseflow to total streamflow) using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) method applied to multi-model simulations from ISIMIP2b. Results show that the BF and SF in the majority of watersheds show consistent trends, but they also show the opposite trends in specific seasons. Over 60% of watersheds in the Northern Hemisphere experienced a decrease in BF contribution to the total streamflow during the June-July-August season. Minimum temperature and NDVI are the most important factors influencing changes in BF and SF . Minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation seasonality, and precipitation intensity show negative effects on the BF , and the impact of vegetation on the BFI varies from region to region. The contribution of BF to the total streamflow decreases significantly at the global scale under the impact of anthropogenic climate change, according to the SNR analysis. The interaction of climate and vegetation changes on changes in BF and SF should take into account to regional adaptation of climate change for the utilization of groundwater and surface water resources.",

Analyzing 12,311 streamflow stations, we found ∼23% of stations exhibit significant trends in variability (∼11% increasing, ∼12% decreasing). A spatial pattern emerges, that is, increasing variability dominates in tropical regions, driven largely by declining low flows, while decreasing variability prevails in cold regions, mainly due to rising low flows. In arid and semi-arid transition zones, changes in variability are strongly associated with reductions in streamflow. Non-free-flowing rivers exhibit a higher proportion of decreasing variability than free-flowing rivers. Further analysis of precipitation variability shows a consistency of variability between precipitation and streamflow only in tropical regions, indicating widespread non-precipitation-led flow regime changes.",

Using CMIP6 multi-model simulations, we quantify influences of human-induced climate change on three CDHW types (i.e., precipitation-based (CMDH), runoff-based (CHDH), and soil-moisture-based (CSDH)) by isolating greenhouse gas, aerosol, and natural forcings (1960-2014). Greenhouse gas forcing emerges as the dominant driver of global CDHW intensification, with CSDH showing the strongest and most coherent amplification of CDHW frequency and severity. Aerosols partially offset warming-induced increases, particularly in monsoon regions. Interpretable machine learning reveals temperature as the primary driver, with precipitation and vapor pressure deficit playing event-dependent roles. Future projections (2015-2100) under high-emission pathways indicate significant severity growth (6.8%, 9.4%, and 15.4% for CMDH, CHDH, and CSDH on average) and sharply rising population exposure (with slope of 0.22, 0.23, and 0.65 for CMDH, CHDH, and CSDH) concentrated in tropical and temperate regions.

      "abstract": "Dynamic water storage reflects the movement of water within a watershed, including infiltration from the surface to the subsurface. In this study, we addressed two questions: (a) What are the spatiotemporal patterns of dynamic water storage during 13 extreme drought events? and (b) How do these patterns correlate with specific hydroclimatic and physiographic characteristics? To answer these questions, we analysed the variability of dynamic water storage d S ( t ), estimated via a water-balance approach as the increase or decrease in storage over time from the beginning to the end of the rainy season across 43 watersheds in south-central Chile (1980-2020), focusing on how meteorological droughts influence watershed storage dynamics. Our results show that dynamic water storage responds rapidly to precipitation, with maximum values ranging from 17 to 632 mm, and declines to negative values during dry periods. On average, storage peaks were observed 126 days after the onset of precipitation. The initial storage reduction during the droughts averaged 51 mm. Lower storage maxima are associated with drier climatic conditions (negative values of the standardised precipitation index [SPI] and the Palmer drought severity index [PDSI]), increased numbers of consecutive dry days in both summer and winter, and catchment characteristics such as higher elevation, steeper slopes and higher flow velocities. Seasonal shifts in storage, with accumulation at the beginning of the wet season and a rapid decline to negative values at the end of the dry season, reflect periods of water connectivity and disconnection, offering critical insights into hydrological modelling and drought mitigation strategies. We interpret the disconnection period as one in which surface water levels decrease owing to the absence of precipitation and increased evapotranspiration rates, highlighting the vulnerability of watersheds to extreme climatic events.",

Here we argue that extreme day-to-day temperature changes, exceeding the 90th percentile threshold of historical records, are an independent, but largely ignored, aspect of extreme weather events. Such extreme temperature changes have a stronger impact on human health in many locations than do diurnal temperature variations. Global observations show that such events have become more frequent since the 1960s in low and mid-latitudes but decreased at high latitudes, primarily due to GHG forcing. Climate models project a further amplification of extreme day-to-day temperature changes under warming, with frequency, amplitude and total intensity rising by ~17%, ~3% and ~20%, respectively, by 2100 in regions covering 80% of global population. Increased extreme day-to-day temperature changes are associated with drier soil and increased variability in pressure and soil moisture, posing substantial risks to societal and ecosystem resilience and adaptation.",

      "abstract": "Groundwater systems exhibit strong spatial heterogeneity and nonlinear dynamics, complicating the parameterization of physically based hydrological models and limiting adaptability at large scales. Deep learning (DL) offers a promising data-driven alternative but faces challenges in prediction accuracy and interpretability. This study proposes a novel Graph Fourier Network (GFN) model that integrates Fourier domain modeling, dynamic graph structure generation, and multi-head graph attention. Hydrogeological units are embedded as prior information, leveraging data from 473 groundwater monitoring wells across the Yellow River Basin (YRB), China. We show that the proposed GFN model significantly outperforms baseline models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Spatio-Temporal LSTM (ST-LSTM), achieving an R 2 of up to 0.90. By incorporating hydrogeological prior knowledge, the GFN model enhances the extrapolation capability of groundwater level predictions, particularly for extended lead times up to 25 days. The predicted groundwater level dynamics show lagged and nonlinear responses to climatic and ecological drivers, with their spatial heterogeneity shaped by hydrogeological conditions. These response patterns include the prolonged influence of precipitation, and spatially varying effects of evapotranspiration and vegetation across hydrogeological units. These findings highlight the GFN model informed by hydrogeological information effectively captures characteristics of regional groundwater system. This study provides a fast and reliable approach for short- and long-term regional groundwater prediction under varying hydrogeological conditions.",

This study assesses the impacts of climate variability (ENSO and IOD) on rainfall in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, central India. The research uses long-term data spanning 44 years (1981-2024) to analyse spatiotemporal variation of climate sensitive indicators such as rainfall, runoff, soil moisture, and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). The main objective of the study is to identify areas in the Central Indian region affected by the combination of ENSO (El Niño/La Niña) and IOD (Positive/Negative) phenomena. The clustering approach, Wavelet analysis, and the Hidden Markov Model are applied to analyse the rainfall pattern over the study area. The study indicates that the negative trends of rainfall, runoff, and soil moisture have shifted to positive trends since 2002. The findings of rainfall associated with climate indices using anomalies and clustering approach indicate that the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) shows a significant relationship with the rainfall pattern than the Dipole Mode Index (DMI). The weighted overlay analysis of climate sensitive parameters with the help of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) indicates that the pure events of Positive IOD and El Niño are strongly linked to increase and decrease in the rainfall respectively, while La Niña, occurring with the negative IOD, is associated with significant increase in the rainfall. El Niño with Negative IOD create unfavourable conditions, whereas El Niño with Positive IOD yield favourable conditions in some areas and unfavourable conditions over other areas of Vidarbha region.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed strong trends in humid heat, including the nearing of human physiological limits in some regions. Understanding of past extremes and their meaningfulness for contextualizing future possibilities, especially in the near-term, is limited by the absence of a global analysis focused on the most extreme humid-heat-anomaly events. Here we identify record-setting humid-heat days for 216 global regions and assess the likelihood of these records being broken even under present-day climate forcing. We use several reanalyses as a historical catalogue, and large climate-model ensembles to represent other statistically plausible events. Unlike the spatial pattern of large temperature anomalies, we find that humid-heat anomalies are most intense, and most seasonally and interannually concentrated, in the deep tropics and arid subtropics. Many top events have attracted little if any prior attention. The eastern United States is especially susceptible to record-breaking humid heat due to modest current records (>1% inferred annual exceedance probability) contrasting with numerous simulated large-anomaly days. Australia and eastern China are also prone to locally exceptional episodes, with >40% of ensemble members simulating events exceeding the ERA5-based distribution maximum. Model biases for key characteristics, together with the observed record-setting day affecting its estimated return period by >2.5x in half of regions, underline several valuable aspects of a joint observation/model perspective on humid heat. This approach aids in evaluating the plausibility of as-yet-unseen extremes; identifying regions of concern that might otherwise be overlooked and underprepared; and gauging regionally specific correlations between event magnitudes and societal impacts.",

The switch of precipitation types not only directly changes the runoff but also influences the response of runoff to other factors, such as landscape or precipitation, which is not fully understood in previous studies. In this study, we modified the snow-involved Budyko equation for catchments with high snow ratio (the proportion of snowfall in precipitation) from the perspective of available water and energy. The elasticity of runoff derived from two modified Budyko frameworks was used to quantify the response of runoff to different factors with snow ratio and aridity index changes at 552 catchments in the contiguous USA. The results indicate that ignoring the effect of snowfall in the Budyko framework leads to overestimation of the elasticity of runoff to precipitation and landscape. With the increase of snow ratio, the elasticities of runoff to precipitation and landscape will decrease. For most catchments, the snow ratio elasticity will increase with the increment of snow ratio, and this trend is more significant in arid regions. A weak negative correlation between the snow ratio elasticity coefficient of runoff and snow ratio in humid catchments with high snow ratios are also detected. This study suggests that under the context of global warming, the decline of snow ratio will cause a more sensitive response of runoff to the changes in climate and landscape, which may result in a great challenge to the water resources management in the future.",

Given the critical role of eco-hydrological conditions in lake functions, this study applied multi-source remote sensing data and image fusion technology to construct continuous high-spatiotemporal resolution Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) (8 days, 30 m) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) (16 days, 30 m) for the Poyang Lake (China's largest lake floodplain system) from 2000 to 2023. A novel Standardized Inundation Area Index (SIAI) was proposed, and then the responses of wetland vegetation growth to hydrological drought in the lake were quantitatively analyzed. Results revealed that EVI of the Poyang Lake floodplain wetlands exhibited a bimodal pattern throughout the year, with peaks in April and September. SIAI trends indicated a long-term worsening condition of hydrological drought in the lake. Evident quadratic relationships were identified between EVI and SIAI at both monthly and annual time scales, with a concave fitted curve showing maximum annual EVI at SIAI = −1.46. The impact of hydrological drought on vegetation growth showed a 1-4 months time-lag effect and a 2-11 months cumulative effect from March to June, though these were potentially interrupted by the summer flooding process. Autumn vegetation growth relied primarily on contemporary lake water conditions. The highlighted quadratic response of vegetation growth to hydrological drought deepens the understanding of floodplain eco-hydrological adaptability under extreme water regimes.",

Recently, frequent occurrences of successive hot-pluvial extremes (SHPEs) have been presented, yet the risk of SHPEs on crop yield has not been investigated. Here we reveal peril of recurrent occurrences of SHPEs during intra-growing season and their connection with subsequent yield loss over breadbasket regions. Our results show an increasing trend in evolution of recurrent SHPEs during intra-growing seasons from 1979 to 2024. A significant risk of synchronized low crop yields is found in breadbasket regions, as shown by negative yield percentage changes and linear regression analysis. XGBoost classifier model predicts a negative likelihood of 49%, 50%, 49%, and 50% for maize, rice, soybean, and wheat yield responses to the emergence of frequent SHPE events, respectively. Alternatively, XGBoost regression surpasses and explains 36% of yield variability caused by recurrent occurrences of SHPEs globally for the studied crops, although it exhibits heterogeneities across different regions. The insights provide a foundation for considering the actual risk, which ultimately contributes to improving crop yield.",

Combining precipitation, stream gauge and demographic data, we quantify the physical drivers and population exposure to this extreme event. Leveraging a Lagrangian MJO precipitation tracking algorithm, we unravel the multiscale interactions responsible for the AR’s development. El Niño favored a large, long-lived MJO that interacted with the North Pacific Jet (NPJ) over more than three weeks.

Given the changing climate, however, an update of these studies is warranted, leveraging the more extensive and longer series of data sets currently available on floods and exogenous climate drivers. Using a Lagrangian particle tracking model (HYSPLIT), this study explores the large-scale moisture delivery pathways associated with monthly floods during the winter season across the CONUS. The contributions of various moisture sources (i.e., land, extratropical Pacific, tropical Pacific, extratropical Atlantic, tropical Atlantic, and Arctic) to winter floods are summarized for each hydrologic region (HUC02) based on the moisture delivery pathways identified by the HYSPLIT model. Our results show that major oceanic sources are the primary contributors to winter floods in coastal regions, whereas land remains a significant source for hydrologic regions over the Midwest. Humidity profiles along the trajectories further indicate that air masses from the Pacific lose substantial moisture when crossing western mountain ranges and subsequently gain over east of the Rockies, making land a key contributor to floods over the upper Midwest. We also find substantial variability in moisture source contributions depending on flood severity in specific regions. In addition, the circulation patterns associated with extreme flood trajectories reveal consistent large-scale features, typically involving a deep low-pressure system delivering moisture to hydrologic regions.",

Specifically, (i) drought events identified by FDT exhibit higher concentrations of DOC, TP, and TN than those by VDT (e.g., the DOC concentration recognized by FDT is 23.11% higher than that of VDT). However, their fluxes are restricted by reduced streamflow (e.g., the DOC flux recognized by FDT is 80.15% lower). (ii) Both methods show drought duration and severity positively correlate with nutrient concentrations, but FDT exhibits faster response rates. (iii) Discrepancies arise because FDT identifies longer, cross-seasonal droughts (25.35% longer average duration), while VDT detects short-term wet-dry fluctuations, fragmenting events. The study reveals that apart from the perturbations caused by drought itself on water quality, the drought identification method used can also make remarkable difference in the assessment of these perturbations, which calls more research or attention.",
